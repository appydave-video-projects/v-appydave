Now I've encountered my first either bug or at least missing the complete
implementation. So the first thing that we notice is that we've got the four
videos that we've recorded so far. If we go over to the ecamm directory I've
created two false starts and we can see them. Now my expectation is that if I
deleted one of these files it should delete, it should get removed from here.
That hasn't happened. The other thing that I'm expecting is that if I come
down here to the other file and press discard it should remove. Now I'll remove
this one so that we can see it and the one that I want to remove which should
affect the actual file here is this value. So we press
discard and it says removed from list but we don't see it actually removed. So
we've got two little issues to resolve.
