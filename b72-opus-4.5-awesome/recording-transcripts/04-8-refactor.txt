so the recording is in place no folder exists right now we'll just click on this
rename and see if it works and it did now that's also interesting notice how
it's saying little fake here and we've got capital fake here I think there's an
issue with the way it I think there's an issue in the naming conventions going on
here now it looks like it's worked correctly so we've got the fake file in
the capital fake directory which is based on this value here I didn't need
to create the directory it did it automatically
