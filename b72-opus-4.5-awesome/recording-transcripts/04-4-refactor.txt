So let's look at one of the functional requirements I just added and that was
as a content creator when I finish recording a video it comes into the
incoming list and it should also automatically increment the sequence
number. So we'll head over to the web application and we can see that there is
a video currently sitting in the ecamm folder and the sequence number is 3
let's just check that 54 is the video that's correct and if we head over here
we do want it to become number 3 so we'll come back to our tool and we'll
just do a rename and hopefully we see a new video we do. Now the next test I want
to do is around these two bugs that we had so I want to be able to delete
videos of my hard drive and have the web interface automatically change also
want to be able to delete it from the web interface and see the hard drive
change
