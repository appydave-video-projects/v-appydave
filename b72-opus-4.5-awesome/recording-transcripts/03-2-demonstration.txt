So what's really cool is it's picked up the file but it did have a minor bug so
when I put in the watch directory and the target directory and I hit save I
didn't see anything happen I never saw any files move I wasn't sure what to
expect and so what I did was I just pasted in the information I had in
screen and a little message and it's told me that the big problem is that the
environment variable that's driving that configuration needed to be changed and
then restart the server so I just said well can you make it so this happens
automatically and so it just built a restart server based on the environment
variable changing and as soon as I hit save it just started working again but
the next question is what happens to the files so this is the this is the
previous recording it's stored in this is the first segment of the recording
now it's just stored as an ecam recording with a date time stamp and
where it needs to be is over in this video project folder under the
recordings directory and it should be named 1-1-intro so we'll come
back to the application and we'll put in a one and we'll leave it with intro and
and we can see what file name it's going to be let's click rename and see what
happens it says renamed to that's really cool because I think it's worked
click on the file yeah that's the same file now renamed at the target location
now what I'm going to do now is stop this segment of the video and what we
should see is a new video pop up here just with the date time stamp so I'll
hit stop
