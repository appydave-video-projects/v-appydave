So I'd finished the video and then forgot that I needed a recap stats like
what have we talked about so let's just go and have a look at what we built
today. Now it's called the Recording Namer proof of concept this is the
development timeline and we can see that the initial Claude code and we can see
that the initial Claude Opus 4.5 took 10 minutes and this built all the and this
built all of the application while I went to bed the next day I got up we
fixed a couple of bugs that took two minutes then I added a bunch of new
features that you saw me do that's about three minutes of coding each time there
were a couple of bugs so I had to do some bug fixing two minutes and then I
had and then I added an auto detect files which was really just working out
that if I started a new web session would it find the next file to create
the stack is relatively complex we've got a server it's using Express 5
socket IO and other sorts of libraries we've got a client in react with Vite
and Tailwind CSS information is being sent directly from my file system to
the web using socket but when we need to query a little bit of information we're
using tan stat query now information is sent directly from my file system to the
web server using the socket IO and the application is in a mono repo with seven
files for the server ten for the client and one file that shared between them
both so everything was done without me actually looking at code it was just
either asking it to follow the requirements updating the requirements
and merging them in or just giving it the odd little you've got a bug here's
some context go and fix it
