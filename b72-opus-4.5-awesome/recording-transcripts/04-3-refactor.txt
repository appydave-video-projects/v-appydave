Now we're about to do a test and you might have noticed something, the camera has changed around and this is one of the issues I have with video recording and one of the reasons why quite often I might have re-recorded the four videos that we've just seen because I have the camera in the wrong location.
I'm not going to worry about it today but what we can see here is that I need to change the target video directory and the reason for that is I went and changed the main directory from Sonnet to Opus, I got the name wrong right at the beginning so what we'll do is we'll just come up here and we'll change this to Opus, that's what the video is going to be about.
Now I'll hit save and I'm also going to keep the configuration and I'm also keeping the configuration reduced so that we can see more information here.
The other thing I've done and this is a pretty normal part of my recording processes is that I've renumbered these because I realised that when I finished this video I want to talk about the scenario, that'll be chapter two and I want to talk about the intro, that'll be chapter one and so I've manually renamed this but this might be a capability I want to add into the tool later on anyway.
But with that house cleaning out of the road let's go down to Ecamm Live where we've got this 53 video here and it's part of the refactor and we'll put it into chapter four to refactor and let's just do a rename and see what happens, it should disappear, it did and it should pop into the right location and rename, this is excellent.
