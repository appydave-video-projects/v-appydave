So I think we've finished testing the application and the refactor except for
this last button called the new chapter and so now we're about to go into a
recap. So what I'd like to do is just see what happens when we press this button
we'll click on it and it says number five which is perfect segment one I
really need to rename that to segment but we'll just call this a recap and so
in the interest of recaps what do we have we have this little config button
we can go and change the recordings it will automatically save it to the
environment file now as well as also creating the directory if it doesn't
exist if we were to hit refresh on a file without anything in it nothing
following the naming conventions it would reset everything to one one intro
we will also go into a new chapter in a moment called the outro that's where
we're going to test some of these tags see what they do but for now I'll stop
the recording
