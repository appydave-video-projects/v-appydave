recorded so what we'll do is we'll just hit rename and we can see that that new
video has come in here 051 recap so the next thing let's just get so now we can
go into the outro so I'll hit new chapter and at this point what I would
usually do is some sort of outro and at this point what I would record is some

I'm at Dave if you are interested in learning a bit about context engineering
then join my school community the link is in the description and what we'll do
now is we'll just come down and change this and we're going to click on this
little tag we'll press that and so now when it saves it it should be 061 outro
call to action so there's a little bit of a tag for me in my video editing
we'll save the video
