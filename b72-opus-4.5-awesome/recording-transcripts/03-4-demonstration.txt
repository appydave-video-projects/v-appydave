and there's the recording in Ecamm and we're already configured. Now one of the
reasons I like to put these names, now one of the reasons I like to have the
names there is that this is how I build my chapters and I use large language
models to read the transcript and read the file names to figure out what a
good chapter heading should be. So we'll make our last manual change this is 013
and we will call it intro and it's filtered in and as we hit the rename and
have a look at the recordings folder we can see that I made a mistake it should
have been demonstration and this is really highlighting why we need to build
in a little bit of automation so it just remembers the name each time and
automatically increments the sequence as we go. So I'll finish this part of the
video and it will be number four segment when I hit stop and then the next stage
we'll move into doing a little bit of refactoring.
