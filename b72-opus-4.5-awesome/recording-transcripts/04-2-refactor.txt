So to fix the actual bugs and also add a couple of new functional requirements
what I've done is I've read in the original Neymar proof of concept file
that built this application I've seen what it's got I can see that part of the
issue is that it hasn't finished off this area autosuggest but what I've done
is created a file called fr which is for the functional requirements but what
I've done is created a file called recording Neymar functional requirements
and if we go and have a look at them what I've done is using story notation
I've said what the bugs are so as a content creator if I manually remove an
ecamm live video from the hard drive I just want it to be removed from the web
interface from the incoming files or if I do it from the web interface I
actually want it to be moved into a trash directory now I've done it as
both bugs and some new functional requirements and what I'll do is save
this file and I've just put in this little prompt that says can we move the
functional requirements there are only five of them into the original Neymar
proof of concept application and I just need it to blend in cleanly so you can
see there that it's put some IDs into it so we'll just say can you implement
and the great thing is it just breaks it up into tasks and we keep going we
should be checking that we are still on the right model it should be
