So what I've done is just finished the recording we were just listening to and
that's a long video it's 23 megabytes and then we've got two little short
videos one is 2.8 and one is 2.6. Now I can already see a nice capability to add
to the application and that would be a combination of the file size and also
the transcript. The transcript would be really useful but the first thing we can
do is just take the bigger video which is this one and do a simple rename. Now
when we do the rename we should see a little toast message here and hopefully
we're going to see this increment to five so we'll run that we've got a toast
and that has incremented to five. Now we've got to get rid of files so we'll
come down to our terminal and we will just pick one of them it doesn't really
matter which one and we'll just delete it off the hard drive here it's gone and
our web interfaces updated automatically so that's perfect. Now we've also got a
discard button here and what we want to see is this file here just get removed
so let's go and click discard and see whether that works that works as well. So
that's awesome we've had three different capabilities that this one is just
seeing the sequence number change and these were the two bugs and that was all
the prompt was. This whole file was and that's all the prompt was this
whole file was just loaded into the original proof concept here and we can
see how it got merged in and let's see actually how long these five different
and it would be interesting to see how long these five and it would be
interesting to see how long these five functional requirements took to get
generated by the new OPUS model and so I did a little question on the
conversation just to how long it was and that was a three minute processing run
so all up this has taken three minutes to fix five bugs we've only tested
three of them so we're not so all up it's taken three minutes to implement
two bugs one functional requirements there should be two others that we
haven't tested yet we'll see whether they work but if you also want to see
how long the entire application took we can just go
