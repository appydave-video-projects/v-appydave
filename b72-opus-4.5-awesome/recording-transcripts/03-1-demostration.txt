So I'm testing this application out for the first time I don't even know if
it's going to work but let's see what happens so here's what we've got to
start with we're going to click on the config button and apparently there's a
location where the ecamm live files will drop and then there's a target where
they're going to end up. So I'm just going to alter this to the actual
directory for me and we'll see whether the tilde actually works as well and
this is based off this particular folder where ecamm live files should drop now
the other now we also need a target directory so what I'm going to do is
create a new folder for this particular video and we're going to call it B72
we'll go with sonnet 2.5 awesome because I'm hoping it is going to be awesome and
we'll create an assets and recordings file and and we'll create an assets and
recordings folder now I'm hoping that this is the folder that the files are
going to get transferred to so we'll come back to this temporary directory
and we've got our target directory filled in again using a tilde for the
user directory
