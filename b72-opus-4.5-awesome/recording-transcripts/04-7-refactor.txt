So what I'll do is I'll just rename this to fake and then we'll hit save and this is just
updating the configuration and then I assume what we've got to do to clear everything out
is just do a refresh and we do a refresh and it leaves it back at the beginning.
So we're on chapter one, number one intro.
So what we'll do is we'll just call this fake I think and another interesting test will
be when I do save the video and I'm ready to rename it will it automatically create
a folder here called capital F A K E will it create a folder here called fake.
