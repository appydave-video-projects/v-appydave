now we've got the reverse of that test so there's a little file here and what
we're about to do is I've removed the fake directory I've popped so what I've
done is I've removed the fake directory and in recordings I've moved the fake
and in recordings I've moved the fake recording to this location but we've
still got one left what we'll do is we'll jump into here change it to
recordings and hit save and at the moment this is incorrect I'm just want
to see what happens if I do a refresh so I do a refresh and it just starts from
scratch so we've got one slight little bug because it would be nice if it
actually read the recordings directory and recalculated what it thinks is the
next set of values so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to come back to so
I think it's really easy to add that new capability I've just put in as a content
creator I should be able to open an application pointed at a folder and have
it recalculate the chapter ID the segment ID and the name so I've just
added this here and with the last five items and with the last two bugs and
three features taking three minutes to create we're just going to make sure that
this new feature is added in I'm just saying now I've just asked it to update
the renamer proof of concept application it's gone and renumbered a
couple of files and it's added in this new functional requirement which is
that it scans the directory on refresh let's go test that out so we'll come
over to our application we are pointing at the recordings directory when we look
at our folders my expectation is that the next number should be 04 number 8
so segment 8 and it should say refactor so let's do a
refresh and here it comes and it didn't work and that's to be expected because I
totally forgot to implement it so we'll just say can you implement so with a
little task list coming up of what it's about to do building in a little model
for checking suggested naming so it is only a suggestion it doesn't need to go
with that but this is important when we first start up that it finds it out so
it says it's done everything that we need I haven't really read this I'm just
assuming it does because I'm pretty impressed with what Opus can do what
we'll do is we'll come back to our system we can see that we're meant to be
at 408 we can see that we're meant to be a chapter for segment 8 if I do a
refresh we so what we'll do is a refresh and see if this works it hasn't worked
and this is the first actual time that we've asked and this is the first time
we've asked Opus to do something and it didn't work and I'm not sure why but
it's usually a fairly easy fix because what we can do is just take context in
this case all the information that's actually wrong because this should be
chapter 4 number 8 because this should be chapter 4 segment 8 refactor we'll
just head down to our screen and say so I've just put in a little prompt saying
that what I was expecting was 8 because the last one was 7 and we'll just paste
in the screenshot from before for context and we'll just paste in the
screenshot before for context and what we'll do is we'll just run a refresh and
see what happens and there we have it chapter 4 segment 8 name is refactor
