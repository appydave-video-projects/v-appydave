Now, interestingly, I also don't need to know where the file is.
I can get Claude to open it for me.
So I'll just say, when finished, can you open the index.html file?
So we'll put that prompt in and we'll just add it to the end of the list.
So you can see there, it's starting to open and it's actually just popped up.
So let's bring it up.
And we've got this progress dashboard, resource grid, timeline view, Kanban board and a combined
dashboard.
Now, I think we should just be able to command click on each of them.
Looks like something's opening up.
Let's go through.
And here we have Claude in action.
So this was based on the progress board.
So let's see what that was related to.
So it looks perfect.
It's just related to the information that was in the beginning of the markdown document.
So we'll come back to the main view.
And the next one is learning resources.
So we've got a bunch of learning resources that we can look at.
Looks like there's some sort of filtration system going on.
So you can filter it by the different learning resources.
Next, we've got a learning timeline.
So this is Voz's journey through Claude code and AI assisted development.
Look at that.
It's got coming soon.
It's got date and time.
It's got this watch the loom recording.
Let's see whether that actually loads.
It does.
So that's the video that was sent through to me where this all started.
And if we move to the next one, we've got Claude code in action, five completed, one
in progress.
So we've got a little Kanban board here by the looks of things.
Perfect.
So it's created a Kanban board.
Maybe there's a little bug or two going on, but it's generally pretty functional.
And what's last?
We've got the Claude code learning hub.
I was about to say it looked like a dashboard, but that's the actual file that's in.
It's called combined-dashboard.html.
So the buttons don't do anything, but we've got our learning resources, activity timeline,
and we've got the video series for Claude going on.
