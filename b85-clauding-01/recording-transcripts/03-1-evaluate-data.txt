Now what you do with this information is really up to you but what we can do is
maybe just interrogate it say are there any categories if we wanted to visualize
it are there any ways that you could see it being visualized so we'll come back
to a terminal and we'll read that document so we'll just come back to a
terminal where we've got the document ready to be loaded and we'll just put in
a prompt along the lines of can you read this information and just tell me two or
three categories or ideas of information that you'd see here and what are
different ways you could see us visualizing this in a HTML page and I'm
just letting that prompt go straight into the terminal and we're running it
and so from this what we can see is that we've got some ideas of what the data is
about but we've also got some ideas of how it could be visualized and it looks
like there's five of them so from this alone we could just spin up five simple
websites.
