Here's our scenario. We're working with Vos and he has a movie studio, AI movie studio and he's learning a little bit of Claude code and he's communicated a really short video to me in Loom.
Basically it's 40 seconds of information with a couple of screenshots.
And what I've done is I've grabbed this and what I've done is grabbed the transcript from Loom by clicking this button.
I've taken this screenshot and I've taken a couple of others.
