Now while it's building that we can kick off another task and it will just run
afterwards and because we've got five different HTML files there I don't want
to have to open them up individually so it might be useful if we had an index
page so what I'll do is start a prompt that says can you also create an index
file and make sure that all five of them are available make sure that it looks
fairly pretty some sort of card system so that we can display them and we'll put
that prompt in I'm not really thinking it through it's just throwing it through
in basically the way I believe it should work that it's following the context of
the conversation so it can draw a lot of information from there that you might
not specifically give yourself and you can see that the third one is finished
but a new one the sixth one being create index page with card navigation has just
been added as the next task in the list
