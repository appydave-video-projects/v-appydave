So what we can do is say, can you generate five different HTML files please and can you put them into this folder?
So I'm letting that prompt go in and I've already just set up a folder for us called Lesson 1
and so hopefully we're just going to see five HTML files.
Now we haven't done anything to think about styling right now.
At the moment we just want to see how can we visualize data.
So Claude will just naturally break this up into tasks and they'll run sequentially.
So the first one will write out the HTML file before moving on to the second one.
