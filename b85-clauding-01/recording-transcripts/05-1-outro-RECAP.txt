So to recap it was fairly easy to get started with Claude bring in a little
bit of context from some documents or from images which we did. We really only
asked a couple of questions could it read the data put it into some sort of
data file if it was more complex I put it into a machine readable format like
JSON but it was nice to have it in a markdown format that we could just read
I also asked it if it could just categorize some of the data and think
about visualization techniques. From there we were able to just generate the
visual HTML pages we did five of them and after that we added in an index file
just to see it all working. It took a couple of minutes to turn raw data
that's coming from disparate sources and turn it into something visual and nice
and turn it into something visual using vibe coding techniques. I'm happy Dave if
