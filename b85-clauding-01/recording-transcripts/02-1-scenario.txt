So here's the scenario I've received a loom from someone who's learning a
little bit of Claude code and they've just given a little progress report it's
only 40 seconds long the video there's only a little bit of context but what
I've done is I've gone and copied it the other thing I've done is just had a look
through the loom and took some screenshots of two or three scenes and
I'm going to use all of this as context
