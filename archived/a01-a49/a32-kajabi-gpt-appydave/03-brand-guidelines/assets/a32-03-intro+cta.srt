1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,490
Styling a Kajabi website.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,790
In this video, we're going to add
in a brand kit, and from there

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,039
there'll be a logo, a favi icon.

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,450
We'll style most of the HTML
elements within our site, and then

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,130
we'll add in some custom fonts.

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,640
And on top of that, we'll
use the Kajabi GPT as both a

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,070
tutor and as a CSS generator.

8
00:00:21,158 --> 00:00:24,473
I like the full potential of
Kajabi with a 30 day trial by

9
00:00:24,473 --> 00:00:27,353
visiting appydave.com/kajabi.

11
00:00:29,128 --> 00:00:32,183

extra, it supports the channel

12
00:00:32,188 --> 00:00:34,103
at no additional cost to you.

13
00:00:34,613 --> 00:00:35,843
