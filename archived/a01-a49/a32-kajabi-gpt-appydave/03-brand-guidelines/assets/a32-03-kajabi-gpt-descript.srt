1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,340
To get started, we wanna set up the
branding, which is the logo, the Favicon,

2
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:07,819
and the default colors for our website.

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:12,490
Now, to find this area, you can
come over to the main website,

4
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:14,469
click the website button.

5
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:15,520
From here.

6
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:19,990
There's a button here called site details,
which will take us back to that menu.

7
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:24,200
the other way to do it is to come
down to the settings, and from in here

8
00:00:24,205 --> 00:00:25,790
you've got all these different settings.

9
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,380
If you typed in brand.

10
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:32,140
You'd find branding in this area
here called marketing Settings.

11
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,270
This is not the area we want.

12
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:37,390
This is only related to
the email marketing system.

13
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,810
Instead, we can come to the site
details that are right here.

14
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:44,800
Now, if we scroll down a little bit, we'll
come to the area where we're just looking

15
00:00:44,805 --> 00:00:50,050
at we branding, where we can set up our
Favicon and our logo and the colors.

16
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:53,379
let's go and have a look at our
branding guidelines document to

17
00:00:53,379 --> 00:00:55,120
see what these values should be.

18
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,989
I like to keep my style guide in Canva.

19
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,620
If we click on the brand button,
we'll come to the different

20
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:02,940
brands that you might have.

21
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,730
I've got AppyDave, what
we're working with today.

22
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:09,690
If I click on that, you'll be able
to see some of the logos that I use,

23
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,360
my color palette, and also the fonts.

24
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:17,070
this is going to be useful as we
transition it over to the Kajabi website.

25
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:20,700
Looking at my current brand kit,
we can see that I've got these

26
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:22,590
logos and we'll click on this one.

27
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:26,190
One of the things I can do
here is figure out the colors

28
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:28,289
for my brand through the logo.

29
00:01:28,295 --> 00:01:32,760
If we click on this, we can see different
colors that are going on within this

30
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,509
logo, but all I wanna do today is
click the download button on it.

31
00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:40,269
Let's quickly look at the color
palette I've got and how I came up

32
00:01:40,329 --> 00:01:43,719
with it so that you can recreate
a color palette that suits you.

33
00:01:44,059 --> 00:01:48,074
I used one of the many color palette
generators that are online, and the

34
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:51,794
main thing you're looking for is that
you have a couple of primary colors.

35
00:01:52,034 --> 00:01:52,364
Now these.

36
00:01:52,864 --> 00:01:57,574
Colors go really well together, and
they work in a situation where I want

37
00:01:57,634 --> 00:02:01,324
either a light color as a background
or a dark color as a background.

38
00:02:01,744 --> 00:02:04,594
On top of that, I have a
couple of secondary colors that

39
00:02:04,594 --> 00:02:06,904
compliment these two quite nicely.

40
00:02:07,404 --> 00:02:10,374
Now, the other two colors that
almost every website needs to

41
00:02:10,374 --> 00:02:12,564
have is a white and a black.

42
00:02:12,694 --> 00:02:14,254
you don't have to go for pure black.

43
00:02:14,254 --> 00:02:18,394
You don't have to go for pure white, but
these are really useful colors to have.

44
00:02:18,689 --> 00:02:23,249
The only other color I've got here is
not really related to my brand, but more

45
00:02:23,249 --> 00:02:28,099
related to my thumbnails, We don't need
to bring this over to the Kajabi website.

46
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:29,799
Moving down to fonts.

47
00:02:29,799 --> 00:02:34,459
We can see I have two different
styles The first one is Bebas Nueue.

48
00:02:34,749 --> 00:02:38,889
This is an external font, and we're going
to need to go and download that from a

49
00:02:38,889 --> 00:02:41,349
website to make it available to Kajabi.

50
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:46,629
The other font I use is Impact, and I use
that 'cause it's a nice readable font,

51
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:51,709
when we do the fonts for the website,
there will be articles and articles.

52
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:57,429
needs something very clean and simple to
read, and it may not be these two fonts.

53
00:02:57,489 --> 00:03:02,139
In the past I have used Bebas Nueue,
but we might pick a different font

54
00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:04,149
specifically for our paragraphs.

55
00:03:04,649 --> 00:03:08,339
Coming back to the site details and
branding, what we're going to do is

56
00:03:08,344 --> 00:03:10,709
we're going to upload a new file.

57
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:15,469
one of the things to be aware of
is that we've got a logo already

58
00:03:15,469 --> 00:03:19,849
on our computer, so what we can do
is click on the my device button.

59
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:24,820
And we'll be given our logo, and if
there's any padding around it that

60
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,399
you don't want, you can just remove it

61
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,829
From there, we click save.

62
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,109
Now, this hasn't put it into Kajabi yet.

63
00:03:31,109 --> 00:03:34,409
We still need to click the
upload button right here.

64
00:03:34,909 --> 00:03:37,809
I quickly converted my
logo into a Favicon.

65
00:03:38,029 --> 00:03:41,479
Now if you dunno what that is, a quick
search would show you that it's the

66
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:47,039
logo as it appears in the browser you
just search for resize to Favicon.

67
00:03:47,399 --> 00:03:50,579
I've gone to one of the many
websites and just dragged my

68
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:53,009
logo into here and downloaded it.

69
00:03:53,559 --> 00:03:58,689
it came back with many different sizes,
but the one I selected was the 32 by 32.

70
00:03:58,689 --> 00:04:02,259
next step is to change the
colors for the default palette.

71
00:04:02,449 --> 00:04:06,079
this won't change anything on your
website just yet, but we'll make

72
00:04:06,109 --> 00:04:08,239
colors available a lot easier.

73
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,254
what we can do is come over to our
brand kit and we'll just select one of

74
00:04:12,254 --> 00:04:16,694
the color codes right here, and then
click on the first one and paste it in.

75
00:04:16,934 --> 00:04:20,264
And all we do is we repeat
that for each of the.

76
00:04:20,764 --> 00:04:21,754
Colors that we've got.

77
00:04:21,754 --> 00:04:24,724
So we've got our first primary
colors being the dark brown

78
00:04:24,724 --> 00:04:26,104
and the light brown set up.

79
00:04:26,605 --> 00:04:30,595
Now in the top row I have five
colors here, dark brown, light brown,

80
00:04:30,595 --> 00:04:32,455
and then the two secondary colors.

81
00:04:32,575 --> 00:04:35,215
And I've also put black,
every other color.

82
00:04:35,215 --> 00:04:39,115
I've just set to white because I
don't want to use an another color

83
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,705
that's off brand by accident.

84
00:04:40,705 --> 00:04:40,735
I.

85
00:04:40,735 --> 00:04:44,125
I wanna point out a mistake that
you may make while doing this.

86
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:49,585
So we have our logo, our Favicon, and
our brand colors, but if you don't click

87
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:51,535
the save button, they will disappear.

88
00:04:51,535 --> 00:04:54,265
make sure you go down to the
bottom and click the save.

89
00:04:54,265 --> 00:04:57,475
bring up our website and talk
about what we're going to do next.

90
00:04:57,685 --> 00:05:01,105
We've got these colors here, like
the buttons that are going on.

91
00:05:01,105 --> 00:05:02,365
We've got more buttons.

92
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:07,345
We've got fonts that might want to
change both in style and in color.

93
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:09,625
We've also got areas.

94
00:05:10,035 --> 00:05:12,075
Like icons that we want to see.

95
00:05:12,405 --> 00:05:14,175
And then of course there was the logo.

96
00:05:14,415 --> 00:05:19,515
So what I'm going to do now is just do
one refresh and we'll see what changes.

97
00:05:19,815 --> 00:05:24,735
And the only thing that should change
is the logo that we've uploaded and

98
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:26,655
the logo that's down the bottom.

99
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:30,805
the reason that other colors didn't
change is that this is only about

100
00:05:30,805 --> 00:05:33,055
changing the default color pickers.

101
00:05:33,175 --> 00:05:35,785
It's not about changing
the elements themselves.

102
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:37,315
We'll do that in the next section.

103
00:05:37,928 --> 00:05:42,458
Let's create a page for our brand
kit, and we'll also use the Kajabi

104
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:47,048
GPT to generate the content that's
going to go onto the brand kit.

105
00:05:47,548 --> 00:05:51,658
So I've just come over to the website
design and I'll click on the pages.

106
00:05:51,848 --> 00:05:54,068
what we really want is a landing page.

107
00:05:54,068 --> 00:05:57,188
So click a landing, and
then you can create one from

108
00:05:57,188 --> 00:05:58,868
scratch with this button here.

109
00:05:59,368 --> 00:06:00,988
we just want a blank page.

110
00:06:00,998 --> 00:06:03,968
we're going to call it brand
kit and we'll hit create.

111
00:06:04,468 --> 00:06:07,718
And it'll create this
page for us with a hero.

112
00:06:07,718 --> 00:06:11,198
We're going to get rid of that because
we're going to write our own content.

113
00:06:11,698 --> 00:06:16,608
Most of the brand kit is going to
be text, we'll go and add a section.

114
00:06:16,608 --> 00:06:19,968
We'll click on text and what'll
happen is it'll show up here,

115
00:06:19,968 --> 00:06:24,048
but for it to be fixed in place,
you have to press the add button.

116
00:06:24,548 --> 00:06:28,808
From there, we'll just go back one
and we'll add one more section in

117
00:06:28,808 --> 00:06:30,878
and we'll call that one text as well.

118
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:33,158
We now have two text areas.

119
00:06:33,448 --> 00:06:35,818
This is where we're going
to put our headings and our

120
00:06:35,818 --> 00:06:37,528
paragraphs and our block text.

121
00:06:37,738 --> 00:06:41,848
This is where we're going to put other
sorts of information like code blocks.

122
00:06:42,348 --> 00:06:45,078
Let's look at the content
we want to create here.

123
00:06:45,168 --> 00:06:49,068
Now, if you click the edit button, you'll
be given this area, and I'm just going

124
00:06:49,068 --> 00:06:51,648
to remove all the information for now.

125
00:06:52,038 --> 00:06:55,698
From there, I want to talk a
little bit about the Kajabi GPT

126
00:06:55,698 --> 00:06:56,838
that I'm putting together now.

127
00:06:56,838 --> 00:06:58,188
This is a work in progress

128
00:06:58,238 --> 00:07:02,768
But essentially the Kajabi site
assistant is designed for helping

129
00:07:02,768 --> 00:07:07,088
me build my Kajabi site, build my
content, show me how to use different

130
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:11,648
features, and if you look at it, you
can set up these concepts called goals.

131
00:07:12,148 --> 00:07:17,428
And the goal is really a context that
you might wanna focus on as you're

132
00:07:17,428 --> 00:07:19,318
developing your Kajabi website.

133
00:07:19,498 --> 00:07:21,508
Maybe it's email driven marketing.

134
00:07:21,778 --> 00:07:24,448
Then there's how do I
use a particular feature?

135
00:07:24,688 --> 00:07:26,458
Do I just wanna short synopsis?

136
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:28,108
Do I wanna step by step guide?

137
00:07:28,113 --> 00:07:30,328
And that's what the
cover and focus is about.

138
00:07:30,398 --> 00:07:34,268
then there's this area that we're going
to use right now called content, and

139
00:07:34,268 --> 00:07:36,848
that's a topic or an area of concern.

140
00:07:37,058 --> 00:07:39,428
And today the topic will be the brand kit.

141
00:07:39,928 --> 00:07:45,268
We'll use this GPT to create the
content that we saw and would like

142
00:07:45,268 --> 00:07:47,938
to put back into this edited area.

143
00:07:48,438 --> 00:07:52,848
We're over on the Kajabi assistant,
and we can click on help, which will

144
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:56,478
give us detailed information, but
if you click on the commands, you'll

145
00:07:56,478 --> 00:08:01,828
just get the basic commands that
you can use within this KajabiGPT.

146
00:08:02,138 --> 00:08:06,038
the one we're interested in
will be the content or write.

147
00:08:06,218 --> 00:08:09,588
So I'm going to type in write,
We're doing a brand kit.

148
00:08:10,038 --> 00:08:13,998
Now this needs a little bit more
of a complex prompt in this case,

149
00:08:14,003 --> 00:08:18,383
What I specifically need are
two separate markdown documents.

150
00:08:18,563 --> 00:08:21,473
They're going to focus
very much on my brand.

151
00:08:21,473 --> 00:08:26,813
In this case, I want the brand kit
to also look like it is part of my

152
00:08:26,813 --> 00:08:29,633
brand, so not just filler a text.

153
00:08:29,993 --> 00:08:36,563
The main thing is that it also adheres to
writing the different HTML elements that

154
00:08:36,563 --> 00:08:39,143
would be on a regular Kajabi website.

155
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:40,113
the reason there are.

156
00:08:40,143 --> 00:08:44,613
Two markdown documents is that
the second one will also be for a

157
00:08:44,613 --> 00:08:49,473
code block, which is a specialized
way of viewing text on a site.

158
00:08:49,753 --> 00:08:54,373
we just press enter on that and
what we should hopefully get is a

159
00:08:54,763 --> 00:08:58,993
couple of markdown documents with
all the different structures that

160
00:08:58,993 --> 00:09:01,633
we need for our brand kit webpage.

161
00:09:02,133 --> 00:09:07,263
It's created all the markdown for my brand
kit, and I'm just going to copy this.

162
00:09:07,293 --> 00:09:12,783
There's also another one, which we'll look
at in a moment, but if we move over to any

163
00:09:12,788 --> 00:09:18,003
product that convert markdown into rich
text, we'll probably get what we need.

164
00:09:18,008 --> 00:09:21,848
this is called Dillinger, and I'm just
going to paste in the information.

165
00:09:22,073 --> 00:09:27,198
markdown format is where you can say
three hashes, means it's a heading level

166
00:09:27,198 --> 00:09:30,288
three, or one hash is heading level one.

167
00:09:30,388 --> 00:09:32,963
you can see it all visualized
over here on the right.

168
00:09:33,153 --> 00:09:38,633
when we copy directly into Kajabi,
it should look very much like this.

169
00:09:39,133 --> 00:09:42,793
just copy from the top of the
document all the way to the bottom,

170
00:09:43,123 --> 00:09:47,323
move over to the Kajabi website
that we were looking at earlier.

171
00:09:47,383 --> 00:09:50,443
Click on the edit button
and just paste it all in.

172
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:54,013
It looks like all the text
that we need is in here.

173
00:09:54,859 --> 00:09:59,659
Now the second markdown that it created
was for some code and on my particular

174
00:09:59,659 --> 00:10:04,069
website code is important, but for
you, it may not be, but this is still

175
00:10:04,069 --> 00:10:06,439
useful to see how this can work.

176
00:10:06,449 --> 00:10:09,689
go over to the brain kit and
we paste it in, it'll firstly

177
00:10:09,694 --> 00:10:12,089
not really look that formatted.

178
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:16,919
What we can do is just put in these
three little ticks above and below.

179
00:10:17,419 --> 00:10:20,899
We get it in a format that
looks a little bit like coding.

180
00:10:21,059 --> 00:10:26,069
copy that head over to our webpage,
now we're going to edit the second

181
00:10:26,069 --> 00:10:30,974
block just paste it in as we see
it Got this code area, we can

182
00:10:30,974 --> 00:10:32,714
hit save and we can hit preview.

183
00:10:33,214 --> 00:10:35,224
Now we're in our brand kit preview.

184
00:10:35,554 --> 00:10:38,734
We can see at the bottom we've
got the code has been added.

185
00:10:38,734 --> 00:10:43,234
It's not very styled, and that's something
we could deal with in a future session.

186
00:10:43,484 --> 00:10:47,924
the main areas we're looking for
is just the general text that

187
00:10:47,924 --> 00:10:49,364
would be part of the brand kit.

188
00:10:49,754 --> 00:10:54,314
We will style it soon, but for now
we look at it and we've got six

189
00:10:54,314 --> 00:10:56,144
different sorts of headings from the H!

190
00:10:56,144 --> 00:11:01,604
To the H2,3,4,5 and 6.

191
00:11:01,979 --> 00:11:05,969
Here we have what's called an ordered
list, and that's why it's numbered

192
00:11:05,969 --> 00:11:10,824
one and two, and we have an unordered
list that's listed with bullet points.

193
00:11:11,324 --> 00:11:17,114
We can see some bold text, italic
text, a hyperlink, and right here

194
00:11:17,114 --> 00:11:19,094
we have what's called a block quote.

195
00:11:19,594 --> 00:11:22,014
Let's now create a little
bit of basic styling.

196
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:25,589
That'll be global to the site,
but we'll see it on our brand kit.

197
00:11:26,089 --> 00:11:30,169
Now we're back on the brand kit and
I've added in one extra component

198
00:11:30,169 --> 00:11:33,589
just so that we can see what a
form and a button could look like.

199
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:37,649
what you can do is head over to
settings, and from here we'll

200
00:11:37,649 --> 00:11:39,149
click through to Style guide.

201
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:42,759
pop up the webpage variant of this.

202
00:11:42,764 --> 00:11:46,899
This is what previewing and as we
change it over on the left, he should

203
00:11:46,929 --> 00:11:49,269
update fairly quickly over on the right.

204
00:11:49,345 --> 00:11:51,805
the first setting to look
at the primary color.

205
00:11:52,025 --> 00:11:56,465
when I was testing this out and I
was looking through different pages

206
00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:00,755
trying to see the primary color
get changed, I was a little bit

207
00:12:00,755 --> 00:12:02,915
confused about what it actually did.

208
00:12:03,415 --> 00:12:08,695
I went over to the Kajabi assistant
and I used the how command and the how

209
00:12:08,695 --> 00:12:13,765
command allows you to learn a little
bit how a feature within Kajabi works.

210
00:12:13,765 --> 00:12:17,995
I just said in the style settings,
I changed secondary body font,

211
00:12:18,025 --> 00:12:21,565
color, and primary color, and
nothing seemed to get affected.

212
00:12:22,065 --> 00:12:24,585
And so we have this information over here.

213
00:12:24,585 --> 00:12:29,825
I'll just point out that the secondary
body font color over here was what I

214
00:12:29,825 --> 00:12:34,055
was also playing around with, and it's
pointing out that some of this might

215
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:39,875
only be related to certain themes
and areas like say a placeholder

216
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:43,655
text, which is one of the reasons
why I put a form onto the system.

217
00:12:44,155 --> 00:12:47,635
when it came to the primary color,
it pointed out that concepts

218
00:12:47,635 --> 00:12:50,005
like links might be what change.

219
00:12:50,055 --> 00:12:52,630
we can see that on the
AppyCast channel link.

220
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:57,330
What we'll do right now is we'll go
to this primary color and we will just

221
00:12:57,330 --> 00:13:00,090
change it to something odd like red.

222
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:04,280
We'll also take the background
color of a button that might

223
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,750
be useful to have a look at.

224
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:09,290
We'll just set it to green and
then we'll scroll all the way

225
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:13,460
down and we'll play around with
this secondary body font color.

226
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:17,360
Let's go with a bright
yellow and the placeholder.

227
00:13:17,545 --> 00:13:20,845
Font color, and we'll
go with this lime green.

228
00:13:21,245 --> 00:13:22,030
hit the save button.

229
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:26,940
When we refresh the page, we can see
that the hyperlink here is red, and

230
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,860
that's matching to the primary color.

231
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:35,610
This lime background color is showing up
within the button, so that looks good.

232
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:39,720
We've also got this other sort of
green, which we saw down the bottom

233
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:45,750
was the placeholder font color and
the secondary body font color has not

234
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,640
shown up in the page that we've got.

235
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:51,050
if you've been playing around with
that one and struggled to figure

236
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:55,580
out what's going on with it, it's
probably related to a specific theme,

237
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:57,075
not to the theme that you are using.

238
00:13:57,575 --> 00:13:59,165
Now I'm just gonna set a cup of.

239
00:13:59,495 --> 00:14:01,175
Brand colors as we go.

240
00:14:01,325 --> 00:14:05,735
The one color that doesn't have a brand
color as yet would be my hyperlinks.

241
00:14:05,885 --> 00:14:09,755
I'm gonna leave it as a basic blue
because that's the sort of color

242
00:14:09,755 --> 00:14:11,825
that you generally see on a website.

243
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:15,930
We'll come to the background color
button, and we now have our global

244
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,510
colors that we previously set up.

245
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,200
I'm just gonna set that
to the dark brown color.

246
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,340
scroll down and we have a look at.

247
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,100
The secondary text.

248
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:29,780
This can go to just a gray, the
placeholder text, which is just here,

249
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,850
will set that to the light gray.

250
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:36,550
Will now click the save button
and refresh our preview here.

251
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:38,500
And we have a blue link.

252
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:44,340
We have light gray writing right
here, and we have a dark brown button,

253
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,110
which is in keeping with the brand.

254
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:46,140
I.

255
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:49,720
let's have a look at the text
labels within different areas.

256
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,270
So we have the button
that we've just done.

257
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,630
It's currently showing as white,
the color from my brand, the light

258
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,670
brown, should work pretty good.

259
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:03,470
we'll put that in place and then we'll
come down to where the heading font is.

260
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,990
And the heading front
should be any of these.

261
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:10,670
Bigger text items, but not the bold
text, we'll click heading font.

262
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:13,910
Let's just change it for red now
just so we can see what it does.

263
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,840
And we'll change the body
font to lime green here.

264
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,020
hit save.

265
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:24,310
a refresh shows a high
contrast, red and a lime green.

266
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:27,830
down the bottom we've got the light
brown on top of the dark brown.

267
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:32,245
I'll come back to the body color and I
should be able to press undo command+Z

268
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:38,755
so this will go back to a dark gray and
if we click on this, We could undo if we

269
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:44,575
want, but what I'll do instead is just
set it to the dark brown from my brand.

270
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:45,745
We can then hit save.

271
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:51,225
We are very similar to before, except
that this is a different color to gray.

272
00:15:51,285 --> 00:15:53,325
It is a brown down the bottom.

273
00:15:53,325 --> 00:15:56,745
We've got the light brown on top
of dark brown for the button.

274
00:15:57,245 --> 00:16:01,865
You might have noticed that the color
controls for the fonts here is a little

275
00:16:01,865 --> 00:16:07,475
bit limited, but what we'll do a bit
later on is just the Kajabi GPT to

276
00:16:07,475 --> 00:16:12,545
create some color codes and CSS for us
so that we can make it more effective.

277
00:16:12,595 --> 00:16:17,415
what I'm thinking is that
if I look at my KajabiGPT.

278
00:16:17,795 --> 00:16:22,555
The way I do GPTs is I use
a font called Bebas Nueue.

279
00:16:22,775 --> 00:16:26,765
We'll want to include that on the
website, but I also have the ability

280
00:16:26,765 --> 00:16:31,475
to have, say, dark brown on light
brown or white on light brown.

281
00:16:31,745 --> 00:16:36,275
And I also have others where it's
light brown on dark brown, and

282
00:16:36,425 --> 00:16:41,495
we'll see how we can use CSS to
make that change on our website.

283
00:16:41,995 --> 00:16:46,525
Something I didn't notice earlier was
that I accidentally changed the button

284
00:16:46,525 --> 00:16:51,060
shape, so at the moment it's full width,
we have concepts like the width, and

285
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,980
I'm going to put that back to auto.

286
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,820
The other thing that we can do
is maybe make it a bit larger.

287
00:16:56,875 --> 00:17:00,715
press save, and we'll just refresh
and have a look at what we get.

288
00:17:01,215 --> 00:17:04,570
we have a button that's auto sized,
so there's a bit of padding around the

289
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:09,430
text, but it doesn't take up the full
area that it's within and it's large.

290
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,690
I don't personally like it to be large.

291
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,720
I'm gonna bring it back to medium,
and while that's happening,

292
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,610
we'll refresh this page here.

293
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:17,990
This is looking good.

294
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:21,320
We could also, if we want,
play around with the radius.

295
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:25,870
this is not something I'm going to do
for my own website, but we can at least

296
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:27,550
have a look at what that looks like.

297
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:33,530
it's not too bad, so I might just bring
it back to about an eight and press save.

298
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:36,760
Let's also have a quick look
at fonts while we're here.

299
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:41,590
Now the fonts I wanna do are going to be
custom, but if you do need to change font.

300
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:45,510
You can come down to this area and
change either the body, which will

301
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:49,710
be the text over here or any of the
headings to have a particular font.

302
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,390
So let's just play around with something.

303
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:58,020
We'll go with dancing script, press save,
and we'll also refresh our sample preview.

304
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:02,570
And now all our headings are
in this running writing format.

305
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:05,430
later on, we will change
this with a custom font.

306
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:09,935
In this section, I wanna quickly go
over another global element that's

307
00:18:09,935 --> 00:18:15,185
not quite related to style and
design, but is on most pages of a

308
00:18:15,185 --> 00:18:17,105
Kajabi site, and that's the footer.

309
00:18:17,605 --> 00:18:21,385
At the moment, we have the brand kit
page open for editing, and one of

310
00:18:21,385 --> 00:18:26,095
the things you'll notice on the left
is the ability to modify the footer.

311
00:18:26,515 --> 00:18:30,535
But the problem is that if you scroll
over and look at the brand kit,

312
00:18:30,805 --> 00:18:35,895
whether it be in a wide landscape
mode like we've got at the moment, or

313
00:18:35,895 --> 00:18:38,115
a portrait mode, there is no footer.

314
00:18:38,445 --> 00:18:42,255
Now, the reason for that is that
this is a landing page, not a

315
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:45,315
regular page on the website, and
landing pages don't have a footer.

316
00:18:45,815 --> 00:18:49,955
So even though we can go into
footer and we can do modifications

317
00:18:49,955 --> 00:18:53,795
here, it won't make a whole lot of
sense doing it from this location.

318
00:18:53,795 --> 00:18:57,605
come out to the pages area, but
we'll click on website instead and

319
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:59,645
we'll just go to this about page.

320
00:19:00,145 --> 00:19:04,855
And this will just make it a little bit
easier for us to see what we're editing.

321
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:09,205
We can have a look at it as
a HTML page preview in both

322
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:11,095
landscape and portrait mode.

323
00:19:11,095 --> 00:19:12,535
we're here on the footer now.

324
00:19:12,535 --> 00:19:17,035
We've already talked about the logo
in the site settings and on the

325
00:19:17,035 --> 00:19:21,445
video that I did, on site structure
is where we looked at this menu.

326
00:19:21,725 --> 00:19:25,715
we're not going to play around too much
with it other than to state that we

327
00:19:25,715 --> 00:19:28,145
can do things like move stuff around.

328
00:19:28,195 --> 00:19:32,635
if I just move the logo down a
couple of points here and we press

329
00:19:32,635 --> 00:19:34,885
save, and we'll refresh the view

330
00:19:34,935 --> 00:19:36,915
We should see the logo move to a.

331
00:19:37,145 --> 00:19:38,045
Different location.

332
00:19:38,545 --> 00:19:42,295
I've reset that and what we'll do instead
is we'll play around with the color.

333
00:19:42,295 --> 00:19:46,765
So the foot of background, I'm
just going to set it to my branding

334
00:19:46,795 --> 00:19:49,255
dark brown for the foot of text.

335
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:52,825
I'm going to change it to the
light brown from the branding.

336
00:19:53,065 --> 00:19:56,875
I'm also going to do the same
thing for the copyright text.

337
00:19:57,065 --> 00:19:58,655
Let's leave it as white for now.

338
00:19:58,905 --> 00:20:04,410
hit save and we'll also refresh
the preview of it, leaving powered

339
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:06,510
by Kajabi and White will be fine.

340
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:12,840
One of the things I do is I leave Kajabi
and powered by on my site because that's

341
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,060
actually a link to your affiliate link.

342
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:21,770
One area I do wanna change is the fact
that it says 2024 Kajabi, and what we

343
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:27,295
can do is just click on the copyright I'm
gonna change it to AppyDave we'll go back.

344
00:20:27,795 --> 00:20:30,885
There we have some basic
styling changes to the footer.

345
00:20:31,165 --> 00:20:35,700
this also then highlights another
issue when we look at our brand kit.

346
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:40,630
we'd set up certain structures and we
played around with a few colors, one of

347
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:45,070
them being the buttons here, but notice
that the buttons have not transferred

348
00:20:45,075 --> 00:20:47,590
over onto the main pages over here.

349
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:51,420
Now let's have a look at the styling
differences between a landing page

350
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,760
and a standard page in Kajabi.

351
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:56,060
over here on the right
we've got our brand kit.

352
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,620
This is a landing page.

353
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:01,370
Notice that when you go to
settings, it's got four available,

354
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:02,870
one of them being style guide.

355
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:05,000
Whereas here we've got the main.

356
00:21:05,355 --> 00:21:09,315
Application, one of the general
pages of the site, and there's a

357
00:21:09,315 --> 00:21:11,565
different set of settings going on.

358
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:16,075
if you go into the style guide for
both of them, they both have the same

359
00:21:16,075 --> 00:21:21,695
setup, but you can modify the colors
individually what we'll do in the case

360
00:21:21,695 --> 00:21:25,715
of the primary color here, we'll just
copy the value because I made that

361
00:21:25,715 --> 00:21:29,605
a custom one, and we can just move
over to this area and paste it in.

362
00:21:30,105 --> 00:21:33,855
When it comes to the bottom color,
we've already got that set up

363
00:21:33,855 --> 00:21:38,205
in our global values, so we just
play around with them as we go.

364
00:21:38,705 --> 00:21:42,705
I'm going to make sure that the
border radius is set to eight we'll

365
00:21:42,705 --> 00:21:47,380
just use the spinner here, and
while it look similar for heading

366
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,090
font, this is slightly different.

367
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:49,810
That's a black.

368
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:53,460
What we'll do is we'll change it
to our brow, and now we'll just

369
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,470
press save and see what happens.

370
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:58,670
Now there's been a slight
change to the headings.

371
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:00,140
They've become the dark brown.

372
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:03,470
It's more noticeable in
our call to action buttons.

373
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:08,290
Let's have a look at how we set up a
custom fonting Kajabi and the selection

374
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:10,240
process that I go through to pick one.

375
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:15,210
This little picture here represents
the differences between a Sans

376
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:17,460
Serif font and a Serif font.

377
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:21,980
According to Google, a serif
font is easier to read in

378
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,630
newspapers and magazines.

379
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:28,930
the word serif has meaning and it
means a slight projection, finishing

380
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:33,690
off the stroke of a letter while the
word sends is a French word, meaning

381
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,020
without or lacking, so without a serif.

382
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,500
Now to look at that in pictorial form.

383
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:44,030
You can see the Serif over here on
this letter, and you can see without

384
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,010
a Serif on this particular letter.

385
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:50,250
let's move over to Google fonts
and custom fonts in general.

386
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:53,500
if you type in Google fonts and
just click on the link, you'll be

387
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:58,180
taken to this page where you can
select custom fonts to download.

388
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:02,370
you'll see here there's 1600
fonts listed at the moment.

389
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,700
The first three here are Sans Serif fonts.

390
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:10,400
The next one is a language specific
font, and here we have another.

391
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:13,730
Now, if we go down a little
bit further, we can see three

392
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:15,980
fonts here that are Serif based.

393
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:20,840
the idea of Serif is that they were
good for newspapers, but for lots

394
00:23:20,845 --> 00:23:24,710
of digital publications, they're
not necessarily the right way to go.

395
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:31,290
Because my website is a tech site,
I will go with a San Serif website.

396
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:35,380
the one I've chosen for my
body text is called Oswald.

397
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:38,925
I'll just type in Oswald
this is what articles on my

398
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:40,186
website are going to look like.

399
00:23:40,686 --> 00:23:46,266
What I'll do is come up and click on
it and we will go with Get Font, and

400
00:23:46,266 --> 00:23:48,336
currently it's in a download list.

401
00:23:48,336 --> 00:23:52,326
we'll just click fonts here and we'll
come back and we'll look at the next font.

402
00:23:52,826 --> 00:23:57,236
Now when I'm creating my GPT
agents, I use three different fonts.

403
00:23:57,286 --> 00:23:59,896
we have a standard Sans-serif font.

404
00:24:00,146 --> 00:24:01,166
called Impact.

405
00:24:01,236 --> 00:24:05,551
the reason I've gone with Oswald on
Google fonts is that it is the closest

406
00:24:05,551 --> 00:24:11,491
font to impact, and then the last font
down the bottom here is the Beba new,

407
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:13,321
and that's what we'll go and load next.

408
00:24:13,363 --> 00:24:15,203
we'll just type in Bebas Nueue.

409
00:24:15,483 --> 00:24:19,983
We'll click through and I will
even type in AppyDave and you can

410
00:24:19,983 --> 00:24:24,153
see what it looks like we can just
press get font, and download all.

411
00:24:24,653 --> 00:24:29,393
I just wanna talk about an oddity in
Kajabi that you might find confusing when

412
00:24:29,393 --> 00:24:31,673
you're trying to work with custom fonts.

413
00:24:31,673 --> 00:24:31,703
I.

414
00:24:32,203 --> 00:24:37,183
I went to the Kajabi GPT, and I
just asked it how is there a central

415
00:24:37,183 --> 00:24:40,093
location for uploading HTML assets?

416
00:24:40,093 --> 00:24:46,603
Like the TTF file we need for custom fonts
or PNGs, JavaScript files, CSS files.

417
00:24:47,103 --> 00:24:49,953
it came back with a little bit of
information about going to settings

418
00:24:49,953 --> 00:24:51,753
and finding the files section.

419
00:24:51,933 --> 00:24:53,793
Now this is a hallucination.

420
00:24:54,293 --> 00:24:57,293
And when you are using chat GPT
in general, you do need to be

421
00:24:57,293 --> 00:24:58,823
aware of this sort of concept.

422
00:24:59,103 --> 00:25:01,233
I just asked it one quick question.

423
00:25:01,413 --> 00:25:04,443
I need to confirm that what
you just said is accurate.

424
00:25:04,663 --> 00:25:08,498
I find this style of context
writing to be a great way.

425
00:25:08,498 --> 00:25:09,818
It's come up with all this I.

426
00:25:10,063 --> 00:25:12,763
Really useful information, but it's wrong.

427
00:25:13,063 --> 00:25:16,573
And so then you just ask it the
simple question, is this accurate?

428
00:25:16,783 --> 00:25:19,453
Can you use Bing to find the right answer?

429
00:25:19,583 --> 00:25:25,038
it comes back with an answer, which I
knew to be true, but I went to the GPT

430
00:25:25,068 --> 00:25:30,948
helper just to confirm, because I find the
whole way of uploading assets to Kajabi

431
00:25:31,158 --> 00:25:34,068
to be very different to most CMS systems.

432
00:25:34,568 --> 00:25:38,928
We're back in Kajabi and we're on the
landing page called Brand Kit, I've

433
00:25:38,928 --> 00:25:41,658
created a new empty section called.

434
00:25:42,158 --> 00:25:43,118
Font downloads.

435
00:25:43,328 --> 00:25:45,668
We'll just click through
we can add some content.

436
00:25:46,218 --> 00:25:50,928
the way we work with fonts with Kajabi
is that you can upload them to the

437
00:25:50,928 --> 00:25:55,668
system through something like a download
button, and that's what we're going to

438
00:25:55,668 --> 00:25:58,008
do here now to add a button to Kajabi.

439
00:25:58,253 --> 00:26:02,663
The easiest way is to use the call to
action element, and then you've got

440
00:26:02,723 --> 00:26:04,673
this little button that we can add.

441
00:26:04,743 --> 00:26:09,893
we had two fonts, we'll just call
this one Oswald ttf, We're going to

442
00:26:09,893 --> 00:26:12,143
change it from URL to download file.

443
00:26:12,643 --> 00:26:18,313
earlier we downloaded Bebas Nueue
and Oswald from Google Fonts and

444
00:26:18,313 --> 00:26:22,613
I've put it into a font directory
the file that you want in particular

445
00:26:22,823 --> 00:26:24,863
will be the one ending in TTF.

446
00:26:25,253 --> 00:26:30,873
we'll click pick file Brows, my device,
and it's added it into this button.

447
00:26:30,873 --> 00:26:33,183
Let's just go back one section.

448
00:26:33,683 --> 00:26:38,943
And we'll add another content area called
Call to action I'm going to call it Bebas

449
00:26:39,033 --> 00:26:41,888
Nueue, we'll go for, download a file.

450
00:26:41,943 --> 00:26:47,996
My device, Bebas Nueue new is now
uploading My two fonts have been

451
00:26:47,996 --> 00:26:50,126
uploaded to the system Oswald.

452
00:26:50,126 --> 00:26:54,776
If I was to right click on it, there
would be the ability to copy the link

453
00:26:55,076 --> 00:26:59,616
to this particular font file, the way
they're going to apply is that anything

454
00:26:59,621 --> 00:27:05,741
that's considered a paragraph or we have
ordered lists, we have unordered lists.

455
00:27:06,006 --> 00:27:07,116
we have hyperlinks.

456
00:27:07,356 --> 00:27:11,286
They're all going to use the Oswald
font and anything that's a heading,

457
00:27:11,286 --> 00:27:16,796
we've got a H1, which is, there
should be one H1 per page that you do.

458
00:27:16,986 --> 00:27:22,651
you've got level two, level three, level
four, level five, and level six headings.

459
00:27:22,921 --> 00:27:24,866
They're all going to use the Bebas font.

460
00:27:25,366 --> 00:27:29,536
The way you make 'em available in
Kajabi is here on the brand kit.

461
00:27:29,536 --> 00:27:34,456
If I back up to the settings page,
there's an area called custom code.

462
00:27:34,456 --> 00:27:39,016
If we click on that, we can either put
in overrides for CSS, which is what

463
00:27:39,016 --> 00:27:41,326
we're trying to do, or for JavaScript.

464
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:43,616
You might not understand CSS.

465
00:27:43,746 --> 00:27:46,086
I'll show you a simple
way of dealing with this.

466
00:27:46,086 --> 00:27:50,556
So if we move over to the landing
page that we've done a sample code,

467
00:27:50,826 --> 00:27:55,956
I've gone and added a CSS template,
that can start with, and we're going

468
00:27:55,961 --> 00:27:59,776
to run it through our KajabiGPT, to.

469
00:28:00,021 --> 00:28:02,931
Input the correct values
into this template.

470
00:28:03,111 --> 00:28:06,931
This will just be a starting point,
the main things going on here is that

471
00:28:06,931 --> 00:28:13,141
I've given it some parameters around
the idea of a font name, A URL Now.

472
00:28:13,141 --> 00:28:15,061
It won't be the URL that's there.

473
00:28:15,061 --> 00:28:18,661
It'll be the URL that we'll
find when we right click on

474
00:28:18,661 --> 00:28:20,971
these buttons and copy the link.

475
00:28:21,421 --> 00:28:23,161
The other area is that.

476
00:28:23,161 --> 00:28:27,421
By default, it'll use a font weight
of normal, and that just gets

477
00:28:27,421 --> 00:28:29,701
inserted into different locations.

478
00:28:29,911 --> 00:28:35,161
So the heading Font, which we've said is
Bebas, will get applied to the H1 through

479
00:28:35,161 --> 00:28:41,516
the H6, whereas the Oswald font will get
applied to the paragraph, the unordered

480
00:28:41,581 --> 00:28:46,011
list, the ordered list, and the anchor
tags, then we can decide what we want to

481
00:28:46,011 --> 00:28:51,411
put in for buttons that are either call to
actions or buttons that are on the form.

482
00:28:51,911 --> 00:28:59,021
Let's turn this CSS template into an
actual working CSS file using Kajabi GPT.

483
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:02,001
just select all the information
that's available and we'll pop

484
00:29:02,006 --> 00:29:04,011
over to the Kajabi assistant.

485
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:08,531
I already have a bunch of commands
that I've set up, what you can do

486
00:29:08,531 --> 00:29:12,131
with this is you can figure out
how to use different features.

487
00:29:12,221 --> 00:29:15,611
You can set a goal for what you
wanna achieve within Kajabi.

488
00:29:15,611 --> 00:29:19,841
You can write content, or in this case
we're going to use the template command.

489
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:24,491
what I'm gonna do is type in template with
the colon and paste in all the information

490
00:29:24,496 --> 00:29:27,161
that I grabbed from the other URL.

491
00:29:27,261 --> 00:29:32,001
what this will do is give us the
option to fill in a few parameters

492
00:29:32,001 --> 00:29:36,201
if we want to, and then write the
CSS file for us, which we should be

493
00:29:36,206 --> 00:29:38,551
able to copy Directly into Kajabi.

494
00:29:39,051 --> 00:29:42,831
Now we didn't define any parameters,
it's just gone with default values.

495
00:29:42,861 --> 00:29:44,271
Everything looks okay.

496
00:29:44,271 --> 00:29:48,531
But what we'll do is we'll jump
back here and make sure we copy the

497
00:29:48,531 --> 00:29:53,831
links to these two font files come
back here and we'll just paste in

498
00:29:53,831 --> 00:29:56,171
a little prompt that says heading.

499
00:29:56,411 --> 00:30:00,821
B, a new and a URL to where
that font file happens to be.

500
00:30:01,181 --> 00:30:07,031
Plus a paragraph called Oswald and a
URL to where that font happens to be.

501
00:30:07,121 --> 00:30:12,956
for buttons, use Bebas Nueue we'll
just regenerate this and hopefully it's

502
00:30:12,956 --> 00:30:18,146
going to create the CSS file we need
and we can just copy and paste it in.

503
00:30:18,646 --> 00:30:21,586
it looks like it's followed the
instructions correctly, we've

504
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:25,996
got font face, Bebas Nueue, and
we've got font face, Oswald.

505
00:30:26,296 --> 00:30:29,176
We've got a URL definitely to my website.

506
00:30:29,176 --> 00:30:33,456
If we scroll all the way to the
right, we've looks like we've got

507
00:30:33,461 --> 00:30:34,936
the right file for Bebas Nueue.

508
00:30:34,956 --> 00:30:36,816
We've got the right file for Oswald.

509
00:30:37,146 --> 00:30:38,376
We come back to the left.

510
00:30:38,706 --> 00:30:43,446
We can see that all the headings are
going to use this Bebas Nueue font.

511
00:30:43,841 --> 00:30:49,061
All the paragraphs and lists are going
to use Oswald and the buttons are

512
00:30:49,061 --> 00:30:51,301
also going to reuse the Bebas Nueue.

513
00:30:51,711 --> 00:30:53,811
we can just click on the copy code here.

514
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:55,751
We're back on the landing page.

515
00:30:55,751 --> 00:30:56,771
We've gone to settings.

516
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:58,241
We'll click on custom code.

517
00:30:58,241 --> 00:31:00,941
we should just be able
to paste everything in.

518
00:31:01,251 --> 00:31:02,991
we'll have to press the save button.

519
00:31:03,541 --> 00:31:08,701
as you can see, we've now got the
Bebas Nueue for all of our fonts, and

520
00:31:08,701 --> 00:31:11,011
we've got Oswald for our paragraphs.

521
00:31:11,251 --> 00:31:13,051
Let's look at them side by side.

522
00:31:13,551 --> 00:31:15,681
here we have our landing page.

523
00:31:15,681 --> 00:31:20,271
In the old style, I haven't updated
the page, but if I hit refresh,

524
00:31:20,571 --> 00:31:22,881
it'll now come to look like this.

525
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:26,741
personally, when I look at it,
I'm not quite happy with it.

526
00:31:26,846 --> 00:31:30,986
I like the fonts, but they're not
working for me the way they are today.

527
00:31:31,286 --> 00:31:33,596
But this is something
I can improve in time.

528
00:31:33,656 --> 00:31:38,276
At least now I have the ability
to really easily change the font

529
00:31:38,306 --> 00:31:42,556
and the style Using the Kajabi GPT
to do a lot of the heavy lifting.

530
00:31:43,056 --> 00:31:48,506
Let's make some basic changes to
our CSS using both the Kajabi GPT

531
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:50,276
and a little bit of manual editing.

532
00:31:50,776 --> 00:31:54,016
The current design is using
two fonts for all the headings.

533
00:31:54,016 --> 00:31:58,936
We're using Bebas Nueue, and for all
the text we're using Oswald, and it's

534
00:31:58,936 --> 00:32:01,216
the text itself that's lacking clarity.

535
00:32:01,376 --> 00:32:05,011
let's go talk to regular GPT and
see what we can do about that.

536
00:32:05,511 --> 00:32:10,521
Now I've come over to a regular ChatGPT
session and I've just asked, is there four

537
00:32:10,521 --> 00:32:16,121
fonts that it recommends readable on the
web and the for it's come up with look.

538
00:32:16,121 --> 00:32:20,321
All right, I've used Roboto before,
so this is the one I think I'll use.

539
00:32:20,531 --> 00:32:24,521
But I asked the question, is
Roboto installed on most computers?

540
00:32:24,521 --> 00:32:27,701
Because if it was, then I
don't have to do anything more.

541
00:32:27,881 --> 00:32:30,401
But it's saying here that
it's more for Android.

542
00:32:30,816 --> 00:32:36,116
I've gone to Google Fonts and I've re
downloaded BBAs, Oswald, and now Roboto.

543
00:32:36,346 --> 00:32:39,526
if I look in the fonts folder, you'll
see that it's a little bit different

544
00:32:39,531 --> 00:32:41,536
to the others that we downloaded.

545
00:32:41,806 --> 00:32:45,986
With these two, we only got
two regular fonts with Roboto.

546
00:32:46,011 --> 00:32:51,856
We got a large variety thin black italic,
and the one I'm really interested in

547
00:32:51,856 --> 00:32:56,646
is just going to be regular, which
will upload into the Kajabi page.

548
00:32:56,646 --> 00:32:58,206
I've gone and added a new button.

549
00:32:58,486 --> 00:33:00,206
we look here and we've got Roboto.

550
00:33:00,226 --> 00:33:03,136
We can right click on that
to copy the URL, which we

551
00:33:03,136 --> 00:33:04,846
are going to need in the css.

552
00:33:05,346 --> 00:33:11,466
Now let's use our Kajabi assistant to make
the changes we want to see in the style.

553
00:33:11,686 --> 00:33:15,616
we already have two font faces set
up, one for Bebas Nueue and Oswald.

554
00:33:15,856 --> 00:33:21,376
We've got all the headings set up, all
the text set up, and all the buttons,

555
00:33:21,436 --> 00:33:23,326
and we need to make some modifications.

556
00:33:23,426 --> 00:33:25,346
I'm gonna do is start
writing some prompts.

557
00:33:25,346 --> 00:33:29,126
So the first one is, can
you introduce a Roboto font?

558
00:33:29,346 --> 00:33:31,956
paste in A URL, which we
got off the previous page.

559
00:33:32,505 --> 00:33:37,696
The next part of the prompt is, can
you use the BA new font for the H one?

560
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:40,606
So I only want it for the
H one and any buttons.

561
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:45,081
we wanna see it for this element here, and
we wanna see it within these two elements.

562
00:33:45,581 --> 00:33:49,360
The next part of the prompt
is can you use the Oswald font

563
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:51,010
for all the other headings?

564
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:52,760
can you make sure they're in uppercase?

565
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:58,340
the other headings is H2 through
H6 and we need something to say

566
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,960
that this is going to be uppercase.

567
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:04,420
Just point out that the Bebas
Nueue font, by default, is always

568
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:06,730
uppercase, but the Oswald isn't.

569
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:10,290
And it's because we're making
it Oswald That's why we're

570
00:34:10,295 --> 00:34:12,300
introducing this uppercase section.

571
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:16,780
let's introduce our new font being the
Roboto font, and we'll just do that for

572
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:21,030
the paragraph list and link elements,
and that happens to be these four.

573
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:25,140
Here we got a paragraph, an
unordered list, an ordered list,

574
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,240
and an anchor tag or a link.

575
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:30,150
Let's update the CSS template.

576
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:35,200
with Roboto font for paragraph list of
links, Bebas Nueue for H1 and Oswald

577
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:37,350
for all other headings in uppercase.

578
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:40,630
as we look through, we can
see that a new font has been

579
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:42,760
introduced being the roboto font.

580
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:49,690
The H1 is the only one using Bebas Nueue,
whereas the H2 through H6 is using Oswald

581
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,360
and it's transforming it to uppercase.

582
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:58,040
All our text elements are using Roboto
and our buttons are using Bebas Nueue.

583
00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:01,950
We do not need to make it uppercase
because that's one of the default

584
00:35:01,955 --> 00:35:06,330
capabilities of this font, so we should
be able to go and click the copy.

585
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:10,680
Just grab that and we'll head
over to the CSS code and paste

586
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,450
it in and click the save button.

587
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:18,330
Here is the updated brain kit with
the Bebas Nueue font, the Oswald font,

588
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:21,300
and everything in text is in Roboto.

589
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:25,880
If you're happy working in a little bit
of CSS, and what you could do is go quite

590
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,280
specific and change exactly what you need.

591
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:33,810
if we look at the hyperlinks here, let's
say we wanted to use a format similar

592
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:39,710
to what I use with my KajabiGPT, whereby
I do things like having white on light

593
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:42,470
brown or dark brown on light brown.

594
00:35:42,785 --> 00:35:47,265
Sometimes I also have rounded edges,
So let's go and manually update the

595
00:35:47,265 --> 00:35:51,195
CSS for this hyperlinks or H6 element.

596
00:35:51,695 --> 00:35:56,795
Here we have the CSS file that was
generated by the Kajabi GPT, and one

597
00:35:56,795 --> 00:36:03,395
of the areas is H2 through H6 being set
with Oswald normal and uppercase font.

598
00:36:03,705 --> 00:36:08,595
we don't want to change this directly
because what we're after is altering the

599
00:36:08,595 --> 00:36:11,175
H6, but we don't wanna affect the others.

600
00:36:11,305 --> 00:36:15,385
we can just go straight after it and
we'll just paste in this block of code.

601
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:19,790
And it's basically saying that
the H6 will already have these

602
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:25,160
concepts, but then what we're going
to do is either add or override.

603
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:28,160
So the example of an override
would be the font weight.

604
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:33,380
So the font weight for H2
through H6 is set to normal.

605
00:36:33,695 --> 00:36:38,615
But for the H6 specifically,
we are going to make it 700,

606
00:36:38,615 --> 00:36:40,265
which is just a bit thicker.

607
00:36:40,685 --> 00:36:45,185
We're also gonna set the color to
white, the background to the light brown

608
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:50,345
branding color, the border radius, which
is the curves on the edges to 10 pixels.

609
00:36:50,415 --> 00:36:52,065
we'll put in a little bit of paddings.

610
00:36:52,065 --> 00:36:55,565
we'll copy this file and just
update it here and press save.

611
00:36:56,065 --> 00:36:57,505
Here we are on our brand kit.

612
00:36:57,535 --> 00:37:01,025
That's the old version
of hyperlinks or the H6.

613
00:37:01,375 --> 00:37:06,925
And with a little bit of an update, it's
now got the bolded white on a light brown.

614
00:37:07,135 --> 00:37:11,785
Or we could do other variations
like not bolded, and using the

615
00:37:11,785 --> 00:37:13,225
dark brown on the light brown.

616
00:37:13,725 --> 00:37:17,355
If you're happy with the CSS that you've
done for the brand kit, then there's

617
00:37:17,355 --> 00:37:19,160
one other change that you need to make.

618
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:23,815
The moment we've got all this styling that
we've added to our brand kit, but if we

619
00:37:23,815 --> 00:37:28,945
go through the other pages of the website,
you'll notice that the styling hasn't been

620
00:37:28,975 --> 00:37:32,395
updated on any of these pages as of yet.

621
00:37:32,895 --> 00:37:37,185
What we've gotta do is go from the
landing over to the website section and

622
00:37:37,185 --> 00:37:41,985
we'll just pick the very first page and
click the customized button on that and

623
00:37:41,985 --> 00:37:46,455
we can click on the settings here, go
to custom code of which this has never

624
00:37:46,455 --> 00:37:50,115
been updated, and we'll just paste
in all the new code that we've got.

625
00:37:50,565 --> 00:37:51,465
Click save.

626
00:37:51,965 --> 00:37:55,595
We've now updated our website
with the Favicon and the logo.

627
00:37:55,745 --> 00:38:00,545
We've got our branding guidelines put
in place, and we've altered the HTML

628
00:38:00,545 --> 00:38:04,535
elements so that they're styled the
way we want and with custom fonts.

629
00:38:05,035 --> 00:38:10,265
I've also updated the Kajabi GPT so that
it's more effective as a tutor, so that

630
00:38:10,265 --> 00:38:15,875
you can also use it to generate CSS and
