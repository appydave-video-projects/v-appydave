1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:05,580
I have a script that I can say in
60 seconds and it took me about

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,470
three or four hours to write.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,160
I did it for a competition and
I've just found out that I need

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,800
to say it in about 30 seconds.

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:18,270
So what I want to do is see if I can
create a prompt that will maintain the

6
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,450
value of this script, but cut it in half.

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:23,970
Here's the idea.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,710
Can you take an awesome script?

9
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,380
Cut it in half, keep it awesome.

10
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,480
I've already created a video and
here's the transcript from it.

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,430
Now, the main things that are in here
that are making it go a bit longer is

12
00:00:38,435 --> 00:00:44,340
that I'm talking about this 555 manifesto,
both at the end and at the beginning.

13
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:47,705
I also talk about the journey
of five different YouTube

14
00:00:47,705 --> 00:00:49,055
channels that I've worked on.

15
00:00:49,595 --> 00:00:54,455
And the problem is I probably go into a
little bit too much depth on each of them.

16
00:00:54,795 --> 00:00:59,684
the idea is, Could we get
ChatGPT to rewrite this script

17
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:01,845
for me in about 30 seconds?

18
00:01:01,904 --> 00:01:04,004
Currently it takes 60 seconds.

19
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:09,324
to get started, let's paste in a
little prompt that I've just prepared.

20
00:01:09,655 --> 00:01:14,664
I need to take this 60 second
script, get five variations.

21
00:01:14,695 --> 00:01:20,465
I want to test them all by listening to
them using AI voices, but I want each of

22
00:01:20,465 --> 00:01:26,300
'em to be 25 seconds or less and this part
of the prompt is essentially setting up

23
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,060
the goal of what we're trying to achieve.

24
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:30,380
But there's one thing that's missing.

25
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:35,885
'cause if I run this prompt
on its own, it won't take into

26
00:01:35,885 --> 00:01:38,135
account what I think is important.

27
00:01:38,135 --> 00:01:44,225
And I've already stated that the 555
manifesto is not actually important.

28
00:01:44,465 --> 00:01:48,185
So I'm going to write another
prompt and we say, before you

29
00:01:48,185 --> 00:01:53,195
proceed, can you make sure to ask
questions about what is important?

30
00:01:53,435 --> 00:01:54,395
We might even add to.

31
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:57,560
That just added this section here.

32
00:01:57,565 --> 00:02:03,230
Keep asking me questions about what
is important until I say write script.

33
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,400
So I need it to interrogate me,
have a look at the script, and then

34
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,680
come back with a set of questions.

35
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:13,850
I'll answer them and when I'm ready,
then I'll ask it to write the script.

36
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:15,920
Now we can just check it all.

37
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,880
It looks all good.

38
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,370
Let's hit go and see what we come up.

39
00:02:19,415 --> 00:02:22,054
With now, I like what's come up here.

40
00:02:22,054 --> 00:02:26,855
It's talked about having five
different questions that it needs to

41
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:29,285
ask me what are the key milestones?

42
00:02:29,435 --> 00:02:33,235
Are there any specific channels to
highlight, which is not the case.

43
00:02:33,235 --> 00:02:34,075
I don't have any.

44
00:02:34,425 --> 00:02:35,565
They're all important.

45
00:02:35,835 --> 00:02:40,245
How essential is it to include details
about followers, speed of monetizing?

46
00:02:40,925 --> 00:02:44,375
It's important, but I can get
rid of it, if that makes sense.

47
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:47,805
Do you have a preference for
mentioning certain achievements?

48
00:02:48,015 --> 00:02:48,855
Not really.

49
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:52,195
is the essence of 555 manifesto important?

50
00:02:52,435 --> 00:02:55,375
Not at all, because that I
can do in a different video.

51
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:56,875
There is one thing.

52
00:02:57,125 --> 00:03:02,255
That I also need to add to this is
that it's done for a competition

53
00:03:02,255 --> 00:03:04,295
by video ranking academy.

54
00:03:04,295 --> 00:03:09,324
It's a course that I'm part of and
I'm trying to create this 30 second

55
00:03:09,349 --> 00:03:12,194
video to submit to that course.

56
00:03:12,254 --> 00:03:14,534
I better try and include
something like that.

57
00:03:14,814 --> 00:03:18,234
let's see what we can add as
answer to these questions.

58
00:03:20,529 --> 00:03:24,069
Now looking at the questions, what
I've done is written five different

59
00:03:24,069 --> 00:03:25,689
answers and we'll go through them.

60
00:03:26,109 --> 00:03:30,999
The first one, which is about milestones
or key points, and I guess the main

61
00:03:31,004 --> 00:03:35,729
thing is because it's a competition
for video ranking academy which is

62
00:03:35,729 --> 00:03:37,649
where I learned a lot of my skills.

63
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:40,049
would be good if it could be highlighted.

64
00:03:40,189 --> 00:03:40,699
Somewhere.

65
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:44,929
Then the next thing is that all
five of the channels are important.

66
00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:48,549
I think maybe they're not,
but I believe they are.

67
00:03:48,909 --> 00:03:50,559
So I'd like to list them.

68
00:03:50,889 --> 00:03:55,179
The main thing is I've separated
them out into three tech channels

69
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:59,709
one channel That is just a personal
challenge for me, and then, The last

70
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:04,929
channel, which is my podcasting, where
I actually create most of my content

71
00:04:05,259 --> 00:04:07,659
to disseminate to the other channels.

72
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:12,909
Then number three, how essential
is it to include followers

73
00:04:12,914 --> 00:04:14,319
and speed and monetization?

74
00:04:14,469 --> 00:04:17,989
It's not really that important from
this sort of video point of view.

75
00:04:18,099 --> 00:04:23,529
You, but number four, it would be nice
if I could highlight the one channel

76
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:28,899
and the one video that just blew my mind
because I was able to capture a trend.

77
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:32,689
I used concepts like
trend jacking and click.

78
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:39,189
Bait keywords and unique concepts
unique content points of view to

79
00:04:39,219 --> 00:04:41,229
monetize a channel really quickly.

80
00:04:41,379 --> 00:04:45,579
So I think it's important that it tries
to capture that detail, but we'll see.

81
00:04:45,859 --> 00:04:50,569
lastly, the 555 manifesto, which
is really a future project, is

82
00:04:50,574 --> 00:04:53,089
not really needed within this.

83
00:04:53,149 --> 00:04:55,009
So let's just press enter and see what.

84
00:04:55,009 --> 00:04:55,519
We get.

85
00:04:56,689 --> 00:04:59,719
G P T has written five
different variations for me.

86
00:04:59,989 --> 00:05:04,519
One of the things I asked it though
was to wait until I said to write

87
00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:09,619
script, so sometimes it doesn't follow
the instructions, but let's have a

88
00:05:09,619 --> 00:05:11,359
look through the five variations.

89
00:05:11,569 --> 00:05:16,519
Normally what I like to do is get the
computer to read them to me, either using

90
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:21,319
eleven labs or Revoicer or one of the
other text to speech tools that I have.

91
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:26,919
what we'll do today is I'll just read
through them all because most of them are

92
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:31,869
off a little bit on what I need, and I
don't yet have what I consider a final.

93
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:38,249
Script Variation One through Video Ranking
Academy, I mastered the art of content.

94
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:39,299
Full stop.

95
00:05:39,809 --> 00:05:42,509
That sentence just feels dead.

96
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,699
It just dies really quickly.

97
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:48,329
It then talks about the five
channels, three being tech, one

98
00:05:48,329 --> 00:05:49,919
being a personal project with.

99
00:05:50,109 --> 00:05:53,119
My heart truly lying with @appycast.

100
00:05:53,649 --> 00:05:56,619
That last statement feels
a little bit wrong to me.

101
00:05:56,619 --> 00:05:58,269
It's not the way I would wanna say it.

102
00:05:58,659 --> 00:06:00,819
I will wanna change this if I go with it.

103
00:06:01,339 --> 00:06:06,229
the idea of gaining 2000 followers
in a week is just a highlight.

104
00:06:06,529 --> 00:06:07,759
It's an all right statement.

105
00:06:08,209 --> 00:06:11,029
The problem is it doesn't
relate to the channel where it

106
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:12,889
happened, which is @appydave.

107
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:15,679
so we may need to play around with that.

108
00:06:15,979 --> 00:06:17,089
Let's have a look at variation.

109
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:22,444
Two, a variation two feels a
lot better from skills honed.

110
00:06:22,444 --> 00:06:26,704
At Video Ranking Academy, I
diversified into five unique channels,

111
00:06:26,904 --> 00:06:31,504
@flivideo, @winningprompts and
@appydave Catering to Tech while

112
00:06:31,504 --> 00:06:33,454
@carnivore90 is my health diary.

113
00:06:33,964 --> 00:06:39,454
But AppyCast is where my story
is truly unfold, so that.

114
00:06:39,474 --> 00:06:43,719
Whole sentences that
feels pretty good to me.

115
00:06:43,989 --> 00:06:47,739
This last statement, did I
mention 2000 followers in a week?

116
00:06:48,049 --> 00:06:51,379
a little bit of context
there might be important.

117
00:06:51,769 --> 00:06:53,569
Let's move on to variation three.

118
00:06:54,529 --> 00:06:59,299
I've just read through number
three and it's okay, but it has a

119
00:06:59,299 --> 00:07:03,709
lot of similarities to variation
one from my point of view, and I

120
00:07:03,709 --> 00:07:06,049
can almost say no straight away.

121
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:07,429
Let's look at variation.

122
00:07:07,459 --> 00:07:07,969
Four.

123
00:07:08,969 --> 00:07:13,619
This one has a starting structure
that's similar to two and

124
00:07:13,739 --> 00:07:15,839
probably okay for me to go with.

125
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:19,919
Thanks to Video Ranking Academy,
I ventured in the five channels,

126
00:07:20,109 --> 00:07:24,539
@flivideo @winningprompts and @appydave
for Tech @carnivore90 for Health

127
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:27,359
and my Dearest @appycast podcast.

128
00:07:27,359 --> 00:07:29,399
I don't really like that last statement.

129
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:31,379
The rest of it didn't really.

130
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:35,619
Really make any sense to me
that the context is a bit vague?

131
00:07:36,129 --> 00:07:37,989
Let's look at variation five.

132
00:07:38,859 --> 00:07:40,839
This one starts off really good.

133
00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:45,969
My journey began at Video Ranking
Academy leading to five dynamic

134
00:07:45,969 --> 00:07:50,679
channels @flivideo @winningprompts,
@appydave for tech enthusiasts

135
00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:53,019
@carnivore90 as a health diary.

136
00:07:53,229 --> 00:07:54,699
It may be a little incorrect.

137
00:07:54,729 --> 00:07:59,409
My journey didn't begin at Video
Ranking Academy, they've been a major

138
00:07:59,409 --> 00:08:06,149
player during my time creating videos,
the and intimate conversations that

139
00:08:06,149 --> 00:08:09,599
@appycast, that's also incorrect
in that what I'm doing right.

140
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,229
Now is more behind the scenes.

141
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:16,669
This is where I figure out how to make
tech do what I need it to do, where

142
00:08:16,669 --> 00:08:18,889
I get AI to do what I need it to do.

143
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,859
to call it intimate
conversations is off the ball.

144
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:27,664
But I do the last statement being
monetized in nine days was a charity.

145
00:08:27,719 --> 00:08:28,409
On top.

146
00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:29,369
Okay.

147
00:08:29,369 --> 00:08:33,099
So that's to me, might be
a better statement than the

148
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:35,169
2000 followers in a week.

149
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:42,139
there was also that idea of getting 4,000
watch hours and I did it really quickly

150
00:08:42,139 --> 00:08:44,599
and I, so far, I've been a one hit wonder.

151
00:08:44,599 --> 00:08:49,489
I haven't been able to achieve that
since, but I learned a lot going

152
00:08:49,489 --> 00:08:50,959
through that particular process.

153
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,969
So it'd be good to highlight that.

154
00:08:53,969 --> 00:08:58,259
Having read through this, I have
a prompt here that I've filled in.

155
00:08:58,709 --> 00:09:03,779
I basically like variation
two and I like variation four.

156
00:09:04,469 --> 00:09:08,459
The section about @appycast,
I've got a preference.

157
00:09:08,489 --> 00:09:13,289
So I've basically say, when talking
about acast, I prefer a statement similar

158
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:18,479
to, and then the last thing is from
an achievements point of view, These

159
00:09:18,719 --> 00:09:21,029
two statements, but I only want one.

160
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:22,919
I don't want both.

161
00:09:23,249 --> 00:09:28,509
So I think we can finish this off
with can you make five scripts using

162
00:09:28,509 --> 00:09:31,299
these new criteria for guidance?

163
00:09:31,569 --> 00:09:33,669
And we'll hit go and see what it comes up.

164
00:09:33,669 --> 00:09:40,079
Up with that G P T started writing some
pretty good scripts, but I did restart

165
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,059
it again and I'll just show you why.

166
00:09:42,339 --> 00:09:47,560
one of the things that you can do at
any time is restart a conversation by

167
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,180
clicking on this little button here.

168
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,145
we'll look at the second one.

169
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,280
Essentially, I wanted it to note
that the achievement was with

170
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:59,390
@appydave, it started writing new
variations again, and in particular,

171
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,760
I really like variation two now.

172
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,170
You can read all of them if you want
to, but essentially variation two.

173
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:06,860
It's kind.

174
00:10:06,955 --> 00:10:09,085
Kind of the sweet point for me.

175
00:10:09,415 --> 00:10:13,795
Thanks to Video Ranking Academy,
I ventured into five channels, fly

176
00:10:13,795 --> 00:10:18,265
video, @winningprompts and @appydave
Tech @carnivore90 for Health and

177
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:20,245
learning with Dave @appycast.

178
00:10:20,455 --> 00:10:24,115
Oh, and a quick brag @appydave
was monetized in just.

179
00:10:24,115 --> 00:10:25,000
To nine days.

180
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:29,050
To me, this feels the way I would
say things and I'd be happy to go

181
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:31,630
with this as a testimonial video.

182
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:35,830
The only thing that might have
been a little bit nicer is if I

183
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:41,130
included dive into behind the scenes
trials and errors at @appycast.

184
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:45,680
Though as I say it, it doesn't
really roll off my tongue, I

185
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,180
think I've got a winner with very.

186
00:10:47,195 --> 00:10:51,635
Variation two, and this is
the script that I'm going to

187
00:10:51,635 --> 00:10:54,225
submit for a little competition.

188
00:10:54,315 --> 00:10:55,125
See how I go.

189
00:10:57,405 --> 00:11:01,605
On a personal note, I've been a member
of Video Ranking Academy for over two

190
00:11:01,605 --> 00:11:07,755
years, and I didn't actually get started
until November last year, but if it's

191
00:11:07,755 --> 00:11:11,235
something you wanna follow up on, then
I've left a link in the description.

192
00:11:11,235 --> 00:11:12,375
It's an affiliate link.

193
00:11:12,715 --> 00:11:17,095
on the other hand, if what you wanna do
is learn techniques around chat G P T

194
00:11:17,095 --> 00:11:21,085
or automating your YouTube influence,
then check out one of the videos

195
00:11:21,085 --> 00:11:22,885
that I have up here in the corner.
