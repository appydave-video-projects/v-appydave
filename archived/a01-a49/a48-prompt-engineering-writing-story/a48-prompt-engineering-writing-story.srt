1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,940
If you asked most people to write a
script or a story using ChatGPT, they

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:07,190
would write a prompt similar to this one.

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:10,820
In this video, I wanna show you
some advanced prompt engineering

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:13,879
techniques that are both
simple and easy to implement.

5
00:00:14,129 --> 00:00:18,540
prompt engineering is something that I
use all the time as a software developer

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:22,949
and a researcher, but as a YouTuber,
I use it for my content creation,

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,500
script writing and image generation.

8
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:26,580
So let's get into it.

9
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,049
You'll learn how to do storytelling
with ChatGPT, but we'll

10
00:00:30,069 --> 00:00:31,809
also look at the multiverse.

11
00:00:31,929 --> 00:00:34,449
How could this look in
the past or the future?

12
00:00:35,011 --> 00:00:38,881
Let's head over to ChatGPT, and
we'll write a simple prompt,

13
00:00:39,241 --> 00:00:42,661
write an illustrated story
about a woman with her cat.

14
00:00:42,871 --> 00:00:47,461
I need to develop characters,
beliefs, origin, story, and finally

15
00:00:47,491 --> 00:00:49,291
write a day in the life story.

16
00:00:49,441 --> 00:00:50,971
So this is what I want to do.

17
00:00:51,181 --> 00:00:55,651
Now there's a problem if you start writing
a prompt like this and press enter,

18
00:00:55,921 --> 00:01:00,966
what'll happen is ChatGPT will go off
and write a whole lot of information.

19
00:01:01,466 --> 00:01:04,406
Because you haven't given
it enough instructions yet.

20
00:01:04,586 --> 00:01:09,056
So what I like to do when I start
a context is I like to say Yay.

21
00:01:09,206 --> 00:01:14,576
And the idea of the Say Yay instruction
is that ChatGPT just responds with, yay.

22
00:01:14,576 --> 00:01:16,736
It doesn't do anything else.

23
00:01:16,956 --> 00:01:20,976
if you have any problems with this, you
can also go into what are called your

24
00:01:20,976 --> 00:01:25,656
custom instructions and give a little bit
of information about the yay statement.

25
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:29,256
Here you can see if you see Yay or read.

26
00:01:29,561 --> 00:01:34,331
Just record the information, and these are
two instructions that I use quite a lot.

27
00:01:34,831 --> 00:01:38,761
With our yay instruction in place,
let's head over and write a prompt.

28
00:01:38,921 --> 00:01:41,561
we've got this prompt and one
of the things to notice is that

29
00:01:41,561 --> 00:01:42,821
there is a structure to it.

30
00:01:43,031 --> 00:01:45,101
So it starts off with a task.

31
00:01:45,401 --> 00:01:50,021
Give me a physical description for, so
this is the task that we're looking to do.

32
00:01:50,261 --> 00:01:54,161
From there, we've got a context,
a blonde brunette, and a Raven

33
00:01:54,161 --> 00:01:56,021
Head woman in her thirties.

34
00:01:56,231 --> 00:01:58,691
After that, we just limited in this case.

35
00:01:58,841 --> 00:02:00,911
To 20 words per person.

36
00:02:01,131 --> 00:02:03,381
we paste it into ChatGPT.

37
00:02:03,531 --> 00:02:07,191
We get the information we want,
and we can see here that we've got

38
00:02:07,191 --> 00:02:11,721
the blonde, the brunette, and the
Raven Head woman in their thirties,

39
00:02:11,721 --> 00:02:13,221
which is a good starting point.

40
00:02:13,721 --> 00:02:17,441
With three physical descriptions about
women, let's now come up with three

41
00:02:17,441 --> 00:02:20,741
types of women, and we'll do three
types of women in their thirties.

42
00:02:20,921 --> 00:02:23,441
Include a job, a hobby, and a personality.

43
00:02:23,501 --> 00:02:25,271
And we'll just keep it to 20 words.

44
00:02:25,421 --> 00:02:29,471
And what ChatGPT t will do is come up
with these simple little descriptions.

45
00:02:29,651 --> 00:02:33,611
We've got a pediatricians software
developer and a marketing executive,

46
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:38,261
and the pediatrician knits in free
time is compassionate, patient, and

47
00:02:38,261 --> 00:02:42,221
always smiling, loves interacting
with children and parents.

48
00:02:42,721 --> 00:02:47,581
Now, later on, we'll randomly mix
physical descriptions with types of women.

49
00:02:47,911 --> 00:02:50,071
But for now, let's go and
look at another character.

50
00:02:50,571 --> 00:02:53,751
Now the story that I wanna build
is around a woman and her cats.

51
00:02:53,751 --> 00:02:57,591
So the next prompt will be,
give me three types of cats.

52
00:02:57,651 --> 00:03:02,901
And what chat GPT came up with was a
Siamese, a Maine Coon, and a Bengal.

53
00:03:03,171 --> 00:03:07,071
And if we look at the main coon, we've
got one of the largest domesticated cat

54
00:03:07,076 --> 00:03:12,891
breeds known for their bushy tails, tuft
ears, and friendly doglike personalities.

55
00:03:13,391 --> 00:03:16,991
Now that we have some basic
description and type information

56
00:03:16,991 --> 00:03:21,611
about the cats and the women, let's
go into how they might be thinking.

57
00:03:21,761 --> 00:03:23,861
Basically, we're looking
at their belief systems.

58
00:03:23,861 --> 00:03:27,401
Now, whether you're a human or an
animal, you do have some sort of a

59
00:03:27,401 --> 00:03:32,651
belief system, and we can get ChatGPT
to build this for us so that the story

60
00:03:32,681 --> 00:03:34,961
is in alignment with the motivations.

61
00:03:35,461 --> 00:03:39,001
We'll do a little bit of research
around belief systems found in women.

62
00:03:39,001 --> 00:03:39,961
give me six.

63
00:03:39,961 --> 00:03:42,841
So that's the number of
philosophical views that we're

64
00:03:42,846 --> 00:03:45,061
going to get from American women.

65
00:03:45,211 --> 00:03:49,351
But what I also wanna do is break
it up into two distinct groups.

66
00:03:49,351 --> 00:03:53,671
So we've got the traditional perspectives
and we've got the polarizing.

67
00:03:53,986 --> 00:03:54,886
Points of view.

68
00:03:55,066 --> 00:03:58,966
And from that we get these six
different philosophical belief systems.

69
00:03:59,146 --> 00:04:04,366
We've got pragmatism, existentialism,
and humanism as traditionals.

70
00:04:04,516 --> 00:04:07,456
And in the radical we've got
postmodern feminism, eCamm,

71
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:09,976
feminism, and transhumanism.

72
00:04:10,476 --> 00:04:13,056
Next we'll develop a
belief system for cats.

73
00:04:13,056 --> 00:04:15,126
And you might be wondering
how can you do that?

74
00:04:15,316 --> 00:04:20,146
the way I look at it is we can have a
life experience that the cat experiences.

75
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:23,056
So gimme three mild
traumas affecting cats.

76
00:04:23,326 --> 00:04:26,626
But we can also have a positive
or a negative experience

77
00:04:26,626 --> 00:04:28,156
based on different scenarios.

78
00:04:28,336 --> 00:04:32,211
So here I've said, list the positive
reaction that they might have.

79
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:37,316
If the owner was around and the negative
reaction that they might have with another

80
00:04:37,316 --> 00:04:41,936
human being or a particular scenario, so
we end up getting these three different

81
00:04:41,936 --> 00:04:47,306
traumas plus two different reactions based
on whether they're around the owner or

82
00:04:47,311 --> 00:04:50,006
around the thing that causes the trauma.

83
00:04:50,506 --> 00:04:53,716
Now that we have descriptions,
types, and belief systems for our

84
00:04:53,716 --> 00:04:58,666
characters, let's develop a personal
identity for each of the characters.

85
00:04:58,936 --> 00:05:03,136
So what we can do is just
ask questions of chat GPT.

86
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:07,486
Now, it already has a lot of context
in the background, so we'll just say,

87
00:05:07,726 --> 00:05:12,086
give me three female names, ages, And
something they might be passionate about.

88
00:05:12,236 --> 00:05:15,866
Now, keep in mind, we've already
developed the concept that these

89
00:05:15,866 --> 00:05:19,886
are women in their thirties, so
the age should be around that area.

90
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:24,596
We know they're American women, so the
names probably will be American in nature.

91
00:05:24,926 --> 00:05:29,396
When we go for the cats and we ask for
the name and the age, we don't expect

92
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:33,596
an age to be 50 years of age for a
cat because they don't live that long.

93
00:05:33,776 --> 00:05:36,386
So let's see what happens
with this basic prompt.

94
00:05:36,474 --> 00:05:40,884
we end up with three female characters
and three feline characters.

95
00:05:40,884 --> 00:05:43,314
So we've got Emily, Claire, and Nora.

96
00:05:43,524 --> 00:05:46,824
They're all in their thirties
except for Emily, who's 29.

97
00:05:47,004 --> 00:05:50,574
And we've got three different
felines, whiskers, Luna and

98
00:05:50,579 --> 00:05:53,334
Oliver, three, five, and two years.

99
00:05:53,454 --> 00:05:58,284
And with the sort of names that might
actually apply to a cat, 'cause no human

100
00:05:58,284 --> 00:06:00,054
would generally be called Whiskers.

101
00:06:00,554 --> 00:06:04,934
Now let's develop our backstory or
the origin story for our characters.

102
00:06:04,934 --> 00:06:09,764
Now, up until now, everything has
been done with pretty simple prompts.

103
00:06:10,064 --> 00:06:12,854
We've got a lot of information
that's being created.

104
00:06:12,854 --> 00:06:15,644
We don't know what information
we want to select yet.

105
00:06:15,824 --> 00:06:20,474
So to build up the origin story is about
drawing all that information together.

106
00:06:20,974 --> 00:06:22,684
So let's get started with the prompt.

107
00:06:22,714 --> 00:06:25,264
And the first thing we're
going to do is write context.

108
00:06:25,394 --> 00:06:30,824
I already selected Emily and Whiskers,
and all we have about them is their name

109
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:35,234
and their age, and we're saying create
a character backstory about these two.

110
00:06:35,444 --> 00:06:37,514
It's going to be 500 words.

111
00:06:37,724 --> 00:06:39,374
Now, from that, I've said.

112
00:06:39,874 --> 00:06:42,214
Specifically that I want to brunette.

113
00:06:42,244 --> 00:06:46,744
Now, we did have a blonde and a Raven
head lady as well, and I've said I

114
00:06:46,744 --> 00:06:50,494
want the main coon out of the three
different types of cats that we had.

115
00:06:50,704 --> 00:06:54,754
But from ChatGPT, I'm going to
let it select the type of woman

116
00:06:54,754 --> 00:06:58,294
there were three to choose from,
and the philosophical perspective.

117
00:06:58,294 --> 00:07:01,174
There were six to choose from,
and from the traumas we'll.

118
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:03,139
Just randomly select one of them.

119
00:07:03,619 --> 00:07:07,069
Now, the next thing you wanna do
is develop a guideline for the

120
00:07:07,069 --> 00:07:11,269
instructions, so ensure all the
categories are covered and expanded.

121
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:15,534
most of the categories were only
about 20 words long, so this expanded

122
00:07:15,534 --> 00:07:19,464
capability says well take it a
little bit further, make it bigger,

123
00:07:19,494 --> 00:07:21,594
but use that as the starting point.

124
00:07:21,924 --> 00:07:23,904
The other thing is don't hallucinate.

125
00:07:24,094 --> 00:07:27,314
What we wanna do is make sure it
doesn't say anything that wasn't

126
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:28,694
in the original information.

127
00:07:28,694 --> 00:07:33,104
So I said, when building the backstory,
include details about their relationship,

128
00:07:33,294 --> 00:07:38,214
And keep consistent to the selected
characteristics of Emily and Whiskers.

129
00:07:38,244 --> 00:07:41,034
the last bit in this
is template expansion.

130
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,034
So we said three to choose
from, six to choose from.

131
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:48,204
And I've just given it a brief instruction
that says when you see choose from,

132
00:07:48,414 --> 00:07:52,674
look up the details from earlier in
the conversation and expand on it.

133
00:07:52,775 --> 00:07:55,145
let's see what chat GPT comes up with.

134
00:07:55,414 --> 00:07:59,614
And firstly, we've got Emily, who we
did select, and we know that Emily

135
00:07:59,614 --> 00:08:05,075
was a 29-year-old now, the career
marketing and the philosophy, humanist

136
00:08:05,254 --> 00:08:10,205
was selected randomly by chat GPT,
but the hair color was selected by me.

137
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:14,950
for the cat, we've got Whiskers, a
3-year-old main coon, and what we can

138
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:20,020
see is that we've got this 500 word
backstory about these two different

139
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:25,000
characters, and hopefully it includes
all the traumas, the interactions, and

140
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,680
just their philosophical points of view.

141
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:30,630
What's really interesting about
developing a bat story this way is that

142
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:33,990
you have all this information about
their philosophical point of view,

143
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:39,180
maybe how they come together, different
background stories, which makes it really

144
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:44,040
easy to develop day in the life sort
of stories or other forms of stories.

145
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:44,100
I.

146
00:08:44,475 --> 00:08:49,605
Now before I go into the actual prompts
talking about Day In the Life, let's

147
00:08:49,605 --> 00:08:51,315
look at how this could be automated.

148
00:08:51,525 --> 00:08:55,875
So one of the things that you can do
with Chat GPT is you can create GPTs

149
00:08:56,145 --> 00:09:00,775
or you can use the APIs, what I'm
about to show you as prompts could be

150
00:09:00,775 --> 00:09:07,605
automated so that every day for the
next 365 days, you could create a Daily

151
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:11,925
Chronicle about Emily and Whiskers
and have a different story each day.

152
00:09:12,425 --> 00:09:15,755
So let's create the first day in
our Daily Chronicles, and here I've

153
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:20,165
said, create a day in the life of
Emily and Whiskers in six scenes.

154
00:09:20,385 --> 00:09:22,005
I've given it a guideline.

155
00:09:22,005 --> 00:09:25,575
I've said, ensure that Emily
and Whiskers are in each scene.

156
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:29,865
Ensure consistency with the
backstory and the Daily Chronicle.

157
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:33,045
Now, if you had more
than one Daily Chronicle.

158
00:09:33,295 --> 00:09:35,215
Day one, day two, day three.

159
00:09:35,455 --> 00:09:38,515
Then you wanna put in a little
bit of information to make sure

160
00:09:38,515 --> 00:09:42,595
it checks the previous days so
that you have continuity of story.

161
00:09:42,865 --> 00:09:44,590
But for this one, what we're going to do.

162
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:49,560
Is make sure that there are four
scenes that are based on our backstory.

163
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:54,550
So we've got a scene where we see the type
of woman that she is, a challenge based

164
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,860
on Emily's philosophical perspective.

165
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:00,940
One that shows the effect
of whiskers under trauma.

166
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:05,180
the last one is the positive reaction
that Whiskers has with Emily.

167
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:10,060
Now when we run the prompt, we end
up getting six scenes created for

168
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:14,380
our day in the life and the first
scene, Is with Emily and Whiskers

169
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,090
doing their morning routine.

170
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:20,990
we move on to a walk in the park,
and based on the guidelines we put

171
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:25,640
into the prompt, we can see that the
scene illustrates Emily's advocacy

172
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,810
for sustainability and her natural
charisma in engaging the public.

173
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:35,120
So as I was going through this, I'm also
trying to make images along the way that.

174
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,200
Tend to fit the style.

175
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,760
So most of the images will have
Emily with a blue shirt, brown hair.

176
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,720
We've got a main coon in each one Scene
number three is just trying to demonstrate

177
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:51,940
the fear or the anxiety that Whiskers
is going on because of mild rain.

178
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:57,010
We take that a step further in scene
number four, where Whiskers is really

179
00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:01,480
affected by a trauma of a kid running
around the cafe that they're in.

180
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,890
But at the end of the
day, they're now together.

181
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:04,640
They're calm.

182
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,400
We've got settled in a quiet
corner of the coffee shop.

183
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:11,810
Emily works on her laptop, and
to finish off the day, we've got

184
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:14,000
the evening relaxation going on.

185
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,060
I.

186
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,920
Now, as I said before, we can
automate that and have every

187
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,630
day created automatically.

188
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:23,860
But another thing that you can do,
and we see this in Marvel movies,

189
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,960
is the concept of a multiverse.

190
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:31,240
So how can we totally change the
style and structure of the story

191
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,040
without changing the backstories?

192
00:11:33,096 --> 00:11:37,596
I wanna base the story off the one
we just created in America, 2024.

193
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:40,776
So we have a prompt that
says, using Emily and Whiskers

194
00:11:40,776 --> 00:11:43,416
Daily, Chronicle America 2024.

195
00:11:43,626 --> 00:11:48,606
Adapt it so that Emily and Whiskers
are real life characters from Hamlet.

196
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,836
it can take the story that we just had.

197
00:11:51,021 --> 00:11:55,281
Rewrite it in a totally different style,
and from here we can see that we've

198
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:59,851
got morning revelations, we've got the
courtyard musings, a play within a play.

199
00:11:59,851 --> 00:12:04,246
we've got terminology we've got graphics
that are very Shakespeare in style.

200
00:12:04,246 --> 00:12:08,596
Then we get into the ghostly encounter
and the confrontation that would map to

201
00:12:08,601 --> 00:12:10,426
the child running around in the cafe.

202
00:12:10,606 --> 00:12:15,466
We got the confrontation going on and
then the end of the day, dark solace.

203
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:20,566
taking this a step further, we can let
ChatGPT come up with our multiverse.

204
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:25,126
So we'll do a new prompt, gimme a
useful ideas for scenarios, keep it to

205
00:12:25,126 --> 00:12:30,886
20 words per item, Emily and Whiskers
in some sort of dystopian future and

206
00:12:30,886 --> 00:12:33,531
a random theme, example, steam punk.

207
00:12:33,561 --> 00:12:36,321
what ChatGPT has come up
with obviously is cyberpunk.

208
00:12:36,321 --> 00:12:37,191
Cityscape.

209
00:12:37,401 --> 00:12:41,271
We've got steampunk metropolis,
we've got a climate dystopia.

210
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:46,556
Let's do a daily Chronicle with six
scenes based on steam punk metropolis.

211
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:52,486
ChatGPT just responds with a similar
structure in this dystopian future.

212
00:12:52,491 --> 00:12:56,926
So from here we've got our morning
ingenuity and twilight triumph.

213
00:12:56,926 --> 00:12:59,116
They're top and tailing the story.

214
00:12:59,176 --> 00:13:02,806
And then in the middle we've got the
market maneuvers, airship encounters,

215
00:13:03,046 --> 00:13:07,156
chased by the cog guard, which would
be similar to the boy in the cafe

216
00:13:07,366 --> 00:13:09,376
and the underground revelations.
