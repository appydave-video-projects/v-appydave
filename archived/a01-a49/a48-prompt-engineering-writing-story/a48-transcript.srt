1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:05,360
If you asked most people to write a script or a story using ChatGPT, they would write

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,100
a prompt similar to this one.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:11,700
In this video, I want to show you some advanced prompt engineering techniques that are both

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,700
simple and easy to implement.

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:18,480
You'll learn how to do storytelling with ChatGPT, but we'll also look at the multiverse.

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,080
How could this look in the past or the future?

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,880
Prompt engineering is something that I use all the time as a software developer and a

8
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:31,360
researcher, but as a YouTuber, I use it for my content creation, script writing, and

9
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,340
image generation.

10
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:33,620
So let's get into it.

11
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,720
Let's head over to ChatGPT and we'll write a simple prompt.

12
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,560
Write an illustrated story about a woman with her cat.

13
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:47,700
I need to develop characters, beliefs, origin story, and finally write a day in the life

14
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:48,200
story.

15
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,920
So this is what I want to do.

16
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,000
Now there's a problem.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,340
If you start writing a prompt like this and press enter, what will happen is ChatGPT will

18
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:02,880
go off and write a whole lot of information because you haven't given it enough instructions

19
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,360
yet.

20
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,900
So what I like to do when I start a context is I like to say yay.

21
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,500
And the idea of the say yay instruction is that ChatGPT just responds with yay.

22
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,520
It doesn't do anything else.

23
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:21,020
If you have any problems with this, you can also go into what are called your custom instructions

24
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:24,540
and give a little bit of information about the yay statement.

25
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,140
Here you can see if you see yay or read, just record the information.

26
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,480
And these are two instructions that I use quite a lot.

27
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,600
With our yay instruction in place, let's head over and write a prompt.

28
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,720
We've got this prompt and one of the things to notice is that there is a structure to

29
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:41,900
it.

30
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,040
So it starts off with a task.

31
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,740
Give me a physical description for.

32
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,000
So this is the task that we're looking to do.

33
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,100
From there, we've got a context, a blonde brunette and a Ravenhead woman in her 30s.

34
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:59,840
After that, we just limit it in this case to 20 words per person.

35
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,280
We paste it into ChatGPT.

36
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:07,600
We get the information we want and we can see here that we've got the blonde, the brunette

37
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,220
and the Ravenhead woman in their 30s, which is a good starting point.

38
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:17,360
With three physical descriptions about women, let's now come up with three types of women

39
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,320
and we'll do three types of women in their 30s, include a job, a hobby and a personality.

40
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,200
And we'll just keep it to 20 words.

41
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:28,240
And what ChatGPT will do is come up with these simple little descriptions.

42
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,500
We've got a pediatrician, software developer and a marketing executive.

43
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:38,180
And the pediatrician knits in free time, is compassionate, patient and always smiling,

44
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,160
loves interacting with children and parents.

45
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:46,500
Now later on, we'll randomly mix physical descriptions with types of women.

46
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:49,100
But for now, let's go and look at another character.

47
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:52,620
Now, the story that I want to build is around a woman and her cats.

48
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:56,360
So the next prompt will be, give me three types of cats.

49
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:01,660
And what ChatGPT came up with was a Siamese, a Maine Coon and a Bengal.

50
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:06,380
And if we look at the Maine Coon, we've got one of the largest domesticated cat breeds

51
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,680
known for their bushy tails, tough to ears and friendly dog-like personalities.

52
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:17,840
Now that we have some basic description and type information about the cats and the women,

53
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,440
let's go into how they might be thinking.

54
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,740
Basically, we're looking at their belief systems.

55
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,180
Now, whether you're a human or an animal, you do have some sort of a belief system.

56
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:33,840
We can get ChatGPT to build this for us so that the story is in alignment with the motivations.

57
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:37,900
We'll do a little bit of research around belief systems found in women.

58
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,900
Give me six.

59
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:43,960
So that's the number of philosophical views that we're going to get from American women.

60
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:48,300
But what I also want to do is break it up into two distinct groups.

61
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:53,840
So we've got the traditional perspectives and we've got the polarizing points of view.

62
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,840
And from that, we get these six different philosophical belief systems.

63
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:03,360
We've got pragmatism, existentialism and humanism as traditionals.

64
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,940
And in the radical, we've got post-modern feminism, eco-feminism and transhumanism.

65
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,920
Next, we'll develop a belief system for cats.

66
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,060
And you might be wondering, how can you do that?

67
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:18,940
The way I look at it is we can have a life experience that the cat experiences.

68
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,940
So give me three more traumas affecting cats.

69
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,960
But we can also have a positive or a negative experience based on different scenarios.

70
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:32,900
So here I've said list the positive reaction that they might have if the owner was around.

71
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:38,780
And the negative reaction that they might have with another human being or a particular scenario.

72
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:44,060
So we end up getting these three different traumas plus two different reactions based on

73
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:48,860
whether they're around the owner or around the thing that causes the trauma.

74
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,260
Now that we have descriptions, types and belief systems for our characters,

75
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,440
let's develop a personal identity for each of the characters.

76
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:02,080
So what we can do is just ask questions of chat GPT.

77
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,700
Now it already has a lot of context in the background.

78
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:11,000
So we'll just say, give me three female names, ages and something they might be passionate about.

79
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:16,540
Now keep in mind, we've already developed the concept that these are women in their 30s.

80
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,880
So the age should be around that area.

81
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,240
We know they're American women.

82
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,460
So the names probably will be American in nature.

83
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:27,080
When we go for the cats and we ask for the name and the age,

84
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:32,580
we don't expect an age to be 50 years of age for a cat because they don't live that long.

85
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,240
So let's see what happens with this basic prompt.

86
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,780
We end up with three female characters and three feline characters.

87
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,200
So we've got Emily, Claire and Nora.

88
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,680
They're all in their 30s except for Emily, who's 29.

89
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:52,220
And we've got three different felines, Whiskers, Luna and Oliver, three, five and two years.

90
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:56,060
And with the sort of names that might actually apply to a cat,

91
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:59,160
because no human would generally be called Whiskers.

92
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:03,760
Now let's develop our backstory or the origin story for our characters.

93
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:08,580
Now up until now, everything has been done with pretty simple prompts.

94
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,760
We've got a lot of information that's being created.

95
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,580
We don't know what information we want to select yet.

96
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:19,280
So to build up the origin story is about drawing all that information together.

97
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,580
So let's get started with the prompt.

98
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,040
And the first thing we're going to do is write context.

99
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:30,540
I already selected Emily and Whiskers and all we have about them is their name and their age.

100
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:34,180
And we're saying create a character backstory about these two.

101
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,340
It's going to be 500 words.

102
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,180
Now from that, I've said specifically that I want a brunette.

103
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:44,360
Now we did have a blonde and a raven head lady as well.

104
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:49,480
And I've said I want the main coon out of the three different types of cats that we had.

105
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:55,180
But from ChatGPT, I'm going to let it select the type of woman there were three to choose from.

106
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:58,520
And the philosophical perspective there were six to choose from.

107
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:02,140
And from the traumas we'll just randomly select one of them.

108
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:06,620
Now the next thing you want to do is develop a guideline for the instructions.

109
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,060
So ensure all the categories are covered and expanded.

110
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:13,020
Most of the categories were only about 20 words long.

111
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:18,280
So this expanded capability says, well, take it a little bit further, make it bigger,

112
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:20,560
but use that as the starting point.

113
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,840
The other thing is don't hallucinate.

114
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:27,600
What we want to do is make sure it doesn't say anything that wasn't in the original information.

115
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:31,960
So I said, when building the backstory, include details about their relationship

116
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:37,120
and keep consistent to the selected characteristics of Emily and Whiskers.

117
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,860
The last bit in this is template expansion.

118
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,020
So we said three to choose from, six to choose from.

119
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:47,100
And I've just given it a briefing instruction that says, when you see choose from,

120
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,700
look up the details from earlier in the conversation and expand on it.

121
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:54,120
So let's see what ChatGPT comes up with.

122
00:07:54,500 --> 00:08:00,000
And firstly, we've got Emily who we did select and we know that Emily was a 29 year old.

123
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:06,860
Now the career marketing and the philosophy humanist was selected randomly by ChatGPT,

124
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,120
but the hair color was selected by me.

125
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,160
For the cat, we've got Whiskers, a three year old main coon.

126
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:17,080
And what we can see is that we've got this 500 word backstory

127
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,580
about these two different characters.

128
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,360
And hopefully it includes all the traumas, the interactions,

129
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,780
and just their philosophical points of view.

130
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,240
What's really interesting about developing a backstory this way

131
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,900
is that you have all this information about their philosophical point of view,

132
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,600
maybe how they come together, different background stories,

133
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:42,880
which makes it really easy to develop day in the life sort of stories or other forms of stories.

134
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:48,020
Now, before I go into the actual prompts talking about day in the life,

135
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,220
let's look at how this could be automated.

136
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:54,780
So one of the things that you can do with ChatGPT is you can create GPTs,

137
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,700
or you can use the APIs.

138
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,300
What I'm about to show you as prompts could be automated

139
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:04,320
so that every day for the next 365 days,

140
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:09,100
you could create a Daily Chronicle about Emily and Whiskers

141
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,140
and have a different story each day.

142
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,260
So let's create the first day in our Daily Chronicles.

143
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:18,940
And here I've said, create a day in the life of Emily and Whiskers in six scenes.

144
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,840
I've given it a guideline.

145
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,500
I've said, ensure that Emily and Whiskers are in each scene.

146
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:28,700
Ensure consistency with the backstory and the Daily Chronicle.

147
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:31,900
Now, if you had more than one Daily Chronicle,

148
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,160
day one, day two, day three,

149
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,740
then you want to put in a little bit of information

150
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,260
to make sure it checks the previous days

151
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,500
so that you have continuity of story.

152
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,820
But for this one, what we're going to do

153
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:48,360
is make sure that there are four scenes that are based on our backstory.

154
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:52,200
So we've got a scene where we see the type of woman that she is,

155
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,680
a challenge based on Emily's philosophical perspective,

156
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,820
one that shows the effect of Whiskers under trauma.

157
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:04,100
The last one is the positive reaction that Whiskers has with Emily.

158
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,840
Now, when we run the prompt,

159
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,120
we end up getting six scenes created for our day in the life.

160
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,920
And the first scene is with Emily and Whiskers doing their morning routine.

161
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,720
We move on to a walk in the park.

162
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,800
And based on the guidelines we put into the prompt,

163
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:24,420
we can see that the scene illustrates Emily's advocacy

164
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:28,660
for sustainability and her natural charisma, engaging the public.

165
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,820
So as I was going through this,

166
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:36,200
I'm also trying to make images along the way that tend to fit the style.

167
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,560
So most of the images will have Emily with a blue shirt,

168
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,840
brown hair, we've got a main coon in each one.

169
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:47,200
Scene number three is just trying to demonstrate the fear or the anxiety

170
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,840
that Whiskers is going on because of mild rain.

171
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,900
We take that a step further in scene number four,

172
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:58,180
where Whiskers is really affected by a trauma of a kid

173
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:00,460
running around the cafe that they're in.

174
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,800
But at the end of the day, they're now together.

175
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:03,580
They're calm.

176
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,340
We've got settled in a quiet corner of the coffee shop.

177
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,160
Emily works on her laptop.

178
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,080
And to finish off the day,

179
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,980
we've got the evening relaxation going on.

180
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,620
Now, as I said before,

181
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:18,500
we can automate that and have every day created automatically.

182
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,460
But another thing that you can do,

183
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:24,700
and we see this in Marvel movies, is the concept of a multiverse.

184
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:30,120
So how can we totally change the style and structure of the story

185
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,820
without changing the bat stories?

186
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:36,400
I want to base the story off the one we just created in America 2024.

187
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,340
So we have a prompt that says,

188
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:42,280
Using Emily and Whiskers Daily Chronicle America 2024,

189
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:47,540
adapt it so that Emily and Whiskers are real life characters from Hemlet.

190
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,820
It can take the story that we just had,

191
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,660
rewrite it in a totally different style.

192
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,480
And from here, we can see that we've got morning revelations.

193
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,880
We've got the courtyard musings, a play within a play.

194
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,900
We've got terminology.

195
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,200
We've got graphics that are very Shakespearean style.

196
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:06,140
Then we get into the ghostly encounter and the confrontation.

197
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:09,260
That would map to the child running around in the cafe.

198
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,340
We've got the confrontation going on.

199
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:14,200
And then the end of the day, Dark Solace.

200
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:15,840
Taking this a step further,

201
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:19,120
we can let ChatGPT come up with our multiverse.

202
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,900
So we'll do a new prompt.

203
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,200
Give me useful ideas for scenarios.

204
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,420
Keep it to 20 words per item.

205
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,040
Emily and Whiskers in some sort of dystopian future

206
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,780
and a random theme.

207
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,400
For example, steampunk.

208
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:36,120
What ChatGPT has come up with us is cyberpunk cityscape.

209
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,880
We've got steampunk metropolis.

210
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,180
We've got a climate dystopia.

211
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,760
Let's do a daily chronicle with six scenes

212
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,500
based on steampunk metropolis.

213
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:49,320
And ChatGPT just responds with a similar structure

214
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,380
in this dystopian future.

215
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,300
So from here, we've got our morning ingenuity

216
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,820
and twilight triumph.

217
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,980
They're top and tailing the story.

218
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,440
And then in the middle, we've got the market maneuvers,

219
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,540
airship encounters, chased by the cog guard,

220
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:06,020
which would be similar to the boy in the cafe

221
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,160
and the underground revelations.

222
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,480
Now that was prompt engineering techniques

223
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,920
that you can use for storytelling.

224
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,960
You can use it to write your scripts,

225
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,400
your marketing material.

226
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,020
You saw that I did a day in the life sort of story

227
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,720
and I could also do dystopian futures

228
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,520
or past multiverse sort of concepts.

229
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,400

233
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:34,520
I'm Appy Dave.

234
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,880
I tend to do videos on ChatGPT,

235
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,340
YouTube automation or prompt engineering.

236
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,860
So I'll see you in the next video.
