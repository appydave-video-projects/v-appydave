1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,929
I had a wonderful
relationship with MidJourney.

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:07,610
We've shared many experiences and
created a lot of memories over the last

3
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:13,879
12 months, and even one month ago, I
renewed our commitment costing $300, so

4
00:00:13,885 --> 00:00:18,919
I was shocked, dismayed, and a little
bit angry when I found myself banned

5
00:00:18,919 --> 00:00:22,310
and when I tried to communicate with
them to find out what had happened to

6
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:24,919
our relationship, they just ghosted me.

7
00:00:25,419 --> 00:00:29,169
Hi, I'm AppyDave, and I'm going to share
what happened, the ban that I got, the

8
00:00:29,169 --> 00:00:35,709
$300 that I lost, what I believe is a
misdiagnosis, and the frustration that

9
00:00:35,709 --> 00:00:38,349
I had dealing with MidJourney support.

10
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:43,660
And then after that, I'm going to show you
16 beautiful alternatives to MidJourney.

11
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:48,419
I've been using MidJourney since
March last year, and I've created

12
00:00:48,419 --> 00:00:53,039
thousands of images that I've used
a lot within my YouTube videos.

13
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:58,709
But last year I did end up switching a
fair bit over to DALE 3 mainly because

14
00:00:58,709 --> 00:01:03,959
I found it easier to work with within
chat GPT, and I'd already done a

15
00:01:03,959 --> 00:01:09,179
video showcasing 200 image comparisons
between the two different products,

16
00:01:09,449 --> 00:01:12,539
across 50 prompts, and in my opinion.

17
00:01:12,779 --> 00:01:13,630
DALE 3.

18
00:01:13,645 --> 00:01:16,945
While not as good as MidJourney
was a worthy contender.

19
00:01:17,444 --> 00:01:21,134
Last month I was talking at a tech
summit and I needed some pretty good

20
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:23,414
images for the presentation I was doing.

21
00:01:23,414 --> 00:01:26,894
So I ended up reactivating
my MidJourney account.

22
00:01:27,134 --> 00:01:30,584
Now, one week later, I found myself
having to upgrade because I'd

23
00:01:30,584 --> 00:01:36,014
used up all the credits that I had
there and I ended up spending $288.

24
00:01:36,044 --> 00:01:40,124
But it was great 'cause the images
I was able to generate for the tech

25
00:01:40,124 --> 00:01:42,584
Summit presentation were just wonderful.

26
00:01:43,084 --> 00:01:45,484
Now, two weeks ago, I moved countries.

27
00:01:45,484 --> 00:01:49,744
I came over to Thailand and not long
after arriving, I started getting

28
00:01:49,744 --> 00:01:54,004
this particular error creation
failed on my MidJourney account.

29
00:01:54,184 --> 00:01:59,524
I headed over to Discord and saw this
error that's saying accessing our

30
00:01:59,529 --> 00:02:02,014
services via automation scripting.

31
00:02:02,514 --> 00:02:05,514
Or third party tools created a ban.

32
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:09,834
Now, I started doing a bit of research
to figure out what was going on because

33
00:02:09,834 --> 00:02:14,364
I hadn't done any automation or third
party scripting, and people had come

34
00:02:14,364 --> 00:02:18,325
up with these issues banned due to
billing, not matching the home address.

35
00:02:18,355 --> 00:02:18,834
Okay?

36
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:20,214
Not my situation.

37
00:02:20,484 --> 00:02:25,825
Someone has taught about losing a $60
subscription and not being refunded.

38
00:02:25,984 --> 00:02:26,974
My situation is.

39
00:02:27,005 --> 00:02:32,464
$288 'cause I spent it for a full year
and I haven't been refunded either.

40
00:02:32,765 --> 00:02:37,445
Then we saw other sorts of issues
with banning going on, and then this

41
00:02:37,445 --> 00:02:41,164
next one gave me a little bit of
a clue to what might be the issue.

42
00:02:41,434 --> 00:02:45,244
This includes IP and
email bans from discord.

43
00:02:45,744 --> 00:02:49,789
I headed over to an email and I
wrote, I can't sign into MidJourney.

44
00:02:50,034 --> 00:02:51,204
I've checked the images.

45
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:55,194
There's nothing that meets the fraud
or the other issues that they listed.

46
00:02:55,474 --> 00:03:00,654
I'm an influencer and basically all
the images that I do for YouTube.

47
00:03:00,654 --> 00:03:03,984
And that's important to
understand because you can't do.

48
00:03:04,054 --> 00:03:07,504
Bad quality images on
YouTube and get away with it.

49
00:03:07,834 --> 00:03:13,174
And what happened was I got this reply
straight away from them saying severe

50
00:03:13,174 --> 00:03:18,374
repeated violations of terms and
services, use of automation, scripting,

51
00:03:18,434 --> 00:03:21,504
APIs engaging in reselling services.

52
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,545
So none of this stuff was going on for me.

53
00:03:23,814 --> 00:03:24,804
And then we had this one.

54
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:27,624
You should have received
notifications in discord.

55
00:03:27,944 --> 00:03:31,994
Informing you of this, that they
would have appeared that you've

56
00:03:31,994 --> 00:03:35,204
interacted with a bot and copies
should have been sent to you.

57
00:03:35,384 --> 00:03:38,654
Now, I've not received a direct
message regarding that, so

58
00:03:38,654 --> 00:03:39,854
I'm not sure what's going on.

59
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:44,024
The other thing that they've stated
here is as per the terms and conditions,

60
00:03:44,204 --> 00:03:46,454
refunds are not issued on band accounts.

61
00:03:46,604 --> 00:03:49,064
So I thought, okay, where do I go now?

62
00:03:49,565 --> 00:03:55,144
So as I reviewed the forums, again, it
got me thinking about this IP address ban.

63
00:03:55,149 --> 00:03:59,195
And the reason it got me thinking about
it is that a year and a half ago, I came

64
00:03:59,195 --> 00:04:03,760
to Chang Mai for six months, and while
I was here, I signed up to an American.

65
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,505
E-commerce platform.

66
00:04:05,804 --> 00:04:09,704
About two weeks later, they sent me
an email saying that I'd been banned

67
00:04:09,734 --> 00:04:11,144
and that I'd been banned for life.

68
00:04:11,144 --> 00:04:15,945
I could not get an account again, and
I ended up in that particular situation

69
00:04:16,094 --> 00:04:21,344
sending details of my passport and my bank
account details, and then funnily enough.

70
00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:25,640
Four months later, when I was back
in Australia, I got a reversal.

71
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,550
So that was a misdiagnosis going on.

72
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:34,190
Now, two weeks ago, I found myself
moving again back to Chiang Mai,

73
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,260
and I was going via the Philippines.

74
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:41,060
So the three places that I find
myself in are Australia, where

75
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,130
I'm either in Sydney or Brisbane.

76
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:47,150
I find myself in Philippines,
and I find myself in Thailand.

77
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:51,799
I ended up sending a reply email to
MidJourney stating that I hadn't violated

78
00:04:51,799 --> 00:04:56,390
any terms or conditions that I was
aware of and that I travel, and that

79
00:04:56,390 --> 00:05:01,520
means that I open on different computers
with different ips, my MidJourney

80
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,960
account, and all they did was reply
stating We can't provide you with any

81
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,299
additional information about your band.

82
00:05:08,299 --> 00:05:11,030
Band Users are not eligible for a refund.

83
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,409
So to be honest.

84
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:17,820
I was a bit gutted by all of that, and
quite angry that I'd spent money only

85
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:22,830
about three weeks earlier and it was all
lost, and they won't even do the courtesy

86
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,659
of communicating with me about it.

87
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,390
Rather than get caught up in the
resentment of dealing with Mid Journey

88
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:32,440
support, what I thought is it's
time for a new relationship and the.

89
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:37,060
Good thing is there are many great
alternatives out there at the moment,

90
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:42,040
so what we're going to do is look
at 16 different AI art generators,

91
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:46,180
and we're going to use three
images that I've used in the past.

92
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:50,250
I've created these in MidJourney,
I've used them in my videos, and with

93
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:54,630
each of them we are going to run 'em
through the 16 AI art generators.

94
00:05:55,886 --> 00:05:57,146
We are going to need a prompt.

95
00:05:57,176 --> 00:06:01,466
So what I thought I'd do is take
each of the individual images and

96
00:06:01,466 --> 00:06:03,786
we'll drag 'em straight into DALE 3.

97
00:06:04,076 --> 00:06:08,396
Once they're in DALE 3, we can actually
ask DALE 3 to tell us what the image

98
00:06:08,396 --> 00:06:12,536
is about, but I'll give it a little
bit extra context by giving it the

99
00:06:12,536 --> 00:06:14,936
original MidJourney prompt as well.

100
00:06:15,026 --> 00:06:16,676
And then when we run it through.

101
00:06:16,841 --> 00:06:17,591
Darly three.

102
00:06:17,741 --> 00:06:19,451
We get a prompt like this.

103
00:06:19,451 --> 00:06:24,131
So in this particular case, create
an animated illustration of a smiling

104
00:06:24,371 --> 00:06:27,071
30-year-old blonde man with eyeglasses.

105
00:06:27,401 --> 00:06:30,551
And then a bit later on it says,
the style should be similar to

106
00:06:30,551 --> 00:06:34,391
modern animated illustrations
with a clean and simple design.

107
00:06:34,511 --> 00:06:38,231
And what we'll do is we'll take
that prompt and the reference image,

108
00:06:38,261 --> 00:06:42,161
and we're just going to run it
through all 16 AI Art generators.

109
00:06:43,276 --> 00:06:46,936
So the first two we'll look
at is Night Cafe and Ideogram.

110
00:06:46,936 --> 00:06:51,676
Now, night Cafe has a nice clean user
interface where you can select different

111
00:06:51,681 --> 00:06:58,666
styles, whereas Ideogram is really good
at doing symbolic art and Ideograms.

112
00:06:58,696 --> 00:07:00,196
we've got two images here.

113
00:07:00,196 --> 00:07:01,816
They're looking pretty clean to me.

114
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:06,799
Next we'll look at open
art and designs ai.

115
00:07:07,099 --> 00:07:10,880
So open art has the ability
to use multiple models.

116
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,969
I think it has something like a hundred
different models that you can use.

117
00:07:13,969 --> 00:07:14,419
designs.

118
00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:19,849
AI can be used for images, but it can
also be used for logos and videos as well.

119
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:26,230
Next to our blue willow, which
is by Limewire and Adobe firefly.

120
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,700
they're both producing
really great images.

121
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,480
We would expect that from Adobe.

122
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,145
But this blue willow
product is also pretty good.

123
00:07:33,645 --> 00:07:33,765
I.

124
00:07:34,265 --> 00:07:36,844
Better mention too, that
we have a Adobe Firefly.

125
00:07:36,844 --> 00:07:40,715
It's like Canva, so you have
the ability to do a lot of other

126
00:07:40,715 --> 00:07:42,875
design tooling with that product.

127
00:07:43,025 --> 00:07:46,414
And that then brings us
onto photo and crayon.

128
00:07:46,414 --> 00:07:50,674
And photo is an interesting one
because it's a graphics editing

129
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:55,855
software and their implementation of
generative art is pretty good, I think.

130
00:07:56,034 --> 00:07:57,594
Then we've got crayon, which.

131
00:07:57,985 --> 00:08:01,164
I had a lot of trouble trying
to get good images from it.

132
00:08:01,164 --> 00:08:06,025
So this is the first time we've come
across an AI art generator that wouldn't

133
00:08:06,025 --> 00:08:10,075
compare to MidJourney, but everything
else has been pretty good so far.

134
00:08:10,075 --> 00:08:10,135
I.

135
00:08:10,634 --> 00:08:16,144
Next we have Dream Studio and
Imagine and Dream Studio has the

136
00:08:16,144 --> 00:08:19,564
ability to have multiple models
as well that you can select from.

137
00:08:19,774 --> 00:08:23,734
And Imagine Art is a
detailed illustration tool.

138
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:26,044
Both of these are producing great images.

139
00:08:26,545 --> 00:08:29,725
Next, we're looking at
playground and hotpot.

140
00:08:29,725 --> 00:08:34,465
Now, playground has advanced
editing features while hotpot also

141
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:37,015
has some editing capabilities.

142
00:08:37,285 --> 00:08:41,215
One of the things I noticed with this
particular image is that to me, it

143
00:08:41,245 --> 00:08:44,845
didn't feel like the illustration
style that was described in the

144
00:08:44,845 --> 00:08:47,320
prompt, but they're still great images.

145
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:51,750
The next two to look at is
Lexia and Microsoft Copilot.

146
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,849
And Lexia in the past has
been an AI Art search engine.

147
00:08:55,854 --> 00:08:59,599
It's a great place to get inspiration,
but they also have creation

148
00:08:59,604 --> 00:09:01,459
tools and we've used them here.

149
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:05,599
And this is a tool I do want deep dive
into and there will be a video on that.

150
00:09:05,869 --> 00:09:10,249
As for Microsoft copilot, it's essentially
daily three, so whatever you're doing

151
00:09:10,254 --> 00:09:12,829
in chat GPT you can do here as well.

152
00:09:13,323 --> 00:09:15,363
the last two in the list are worlds apart.

153
00:09:15,363 --> 00:09:18,433
So we've got Leonardo
AI and Diffusion Bee.

154
00:09:18,693 --> 00:09:23,493
Now, Leonardo AI has a lot of
advanced tooling and creativity

155
00:09:23,498 --> 00:09:24,723
that you can do within it.

156
00:09:24,993 --> 00:09:29,043
Diffusion Bee, on the other hand,
is a local computer implementation.

157
00:09:29,043 --> 00:09:33,573
So in my case, it's running on the
Mac and it is a stable diffusion, and

158
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:37,413
I wasn't really able to get any good
images out of this particular model.

159
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:43,983
So for the prompt of the 30-year-old
man creative animated illustration,

160
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:47,793
we've got 16 different variations
here and there are plenty of

161
00:09:47,793 --> 00:09:51,993
great contenders to go up against
MidJourney in this particular case.

162
00:09:52,323 --> 00:09:55,923
What we'll do now is we'll move on
to the next reference image, and I'll

163
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:59,153
give you a little bit more detail about
each of these applications as we go.

164
00:09:59,653 --> 00:10:03,823
Start by dragging the reference
image over into DALE 3.

165
00:10:04,183 --> 00:10:07,903
We'll also use the original prompt
from MidJourney, which had things

166
00:10:07,903 --> 00:10:10,633
like the style raw stylized 500.

167
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:15,013
Now this won't be able to be used
effectively in the other art generators,

168
00:10:15,013 --> 00:10:19,993
so the generation of the prompt is
here, create a realistic illustration

169
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:24,423
of a woman in her thirties shown side
profile, and we got all that information.

170
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:28,263
And this is what we're going to
feed into the 16 AI art generators.

171
00:10:28,263 --> 00:10:32,193
moving over to the final overview
with this reference image, we've

172
00:10:32,253 --> 00:10:34,833
again got a lot of great examples.

173
00:10:35,073 --> 00:10:39,453
Now, if there's a particular tool that you
want me to do a deep dive in, let me know.

174
00:10:39,693 --> 00:10:43,263
Now, I am going to do a two or
three minute video on pretty

175
00:10:43,263 --> 00:10:45,273
much everything that's here.

176
00:10:45,773 --> 00:10:50,243
But there are a couple here that I'm
going to use professionally with my

177
00:10:50,243 --> 00:10:54,143
YouTube videos, and they're the ones
that I'm going to deep dive into.

178
00:10:54,143 --> 00:10:57,563
So let me know which ones you're
interested in and I'll do a video on them.

179
00:10:58,063 --> 00:11:02,683
The first example we've got here is
Night Cafe and Ideogram, and both

180
00:11:02,683 --> 00:11:05,173
images are pretty good in my opinion.

181
00:11:05,533 --> 00:11:07,873
Let's talk a little bit about Night Cafe.

182
00:11:08,373 --> 00:11:12,253
This tool you can use
Stable Diffusion or DALE 3.

183
00:11:12,273 --> 00:11:17,793
You've also got access to print on demand
and can select different art styles.

184
00:11:18,293 --> 00:11:22,253
I'll tell you more about Ideogram when
we look at the third reference image.

185
00:11:22,253 --> 00:11:26,123
But moving on, we can look
at open art and design ai.

186
00:11:26,313 --> 00:11:28,383
we've got interesting styles.

187
00:11:28,443 --> 00:11:33,663
Maybe the one from Designs AI isn't
as good as the MidJourney one, but

188
00:11:33,663 --> 00:11:38,323
the open art one is quite impressive,
the thing about this particular tool

189
00:11:38,803 --> 00:11:43,243
is that apart from image generation,
it's pretty good with anime characters

190
00:11:43,243 --> 00:11:45,553
and it's also got a image upscale.

191
00:11:46,053 --> 00:11:48,633
Moving on to Blue Willow
and Adobe Firefly.

192
00:11:48,683 --> 00:11:51,233
Blue Willow is great as a tool.

193
00:11:51,238 --> 00:11:54,173
It has many different styles
that you can work from.

194
00:11:54,353 --> 00:11:59,303
It's got some tools like background,
removers, blurs, 3D models, and

195
00:11:59,303 --> 00:12:03,863
one of its key advantages is that
it's quick at generating images.

196
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,810
Let's now have a look at photo and crayon.

197
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:13,000
Now, crayon light before doesn't really
do a great job of generating images,

198
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,340
but photo is really interesting.

199
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:20,199
'cause not only is it generating a good
image, but it's a really powerful tool.

200
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:20,260
I.

201
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:26,670
We've got photo enhancement, like
upscaling background removal in painting.

202
00:12:27,169 --> 00:12:32,269
It's also got realistic human face
generation, so it can do things like

203
00:12:32,269 --> 00:12:38,239
skin tones, hair accessories, those sorts
of features, which are really hard to

204
00:12:38,239 --> 00:12:40,964
do with general tools like MidJourney.

205
00:12:41,464 --> 00:12:45,244
It's got all the different styles of
art that you might want to do, which

206
00:12:45,244 --> 00:12:51,034
you would expect from a lot of the image
generations, but it can also do transforms

207
00:12:51,034 --> 00:12:53,484
from one style to another overall.

208
00:12:53,484 --> 00:12:57,294
If you want image generation, but
you also want image editing, this

209
00:12:57,294 --> 00:12:59,004
might be a great tool to look at.

210
00:12:59,504 --> 00:13:04,934
Moving on to Dream Studio and
imagine we've got good images being

211
00:13:04,934 --> 00:13:06,674
generated based on the prompt.

212
00:13:06,884 --> 00:13:08,564
Let's talk about Dream Studio.

213
00:13:09,064 --> 00:13:13,114
It's by stability AI using
the stable diffusion model.

214
00:13:13,264 --> 00:13:16,834
Now it's got all your text to
image sort of capabilities.

215
00:13:16,834 --> 00:13:21,364
It can also do image to image, so
you can take an image and alter it.

216
00:13:21,829 --> 00:13:25,039
And it's got capabilities
like image upscaling.

217
00:13:25,539 --> 00:13:28,269
Looking now at playground and hotpot.

218
00:13:28,299 --> 00:13:30,999
So in this case, the
images are pretty good.

219
00:13:30,999 --> 00:13:35,919
the playground has this really nice
user interface and a very generous

220
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:37,899
usage limit on a daily basis.

221
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:39,989
It uses different models.

222
00:13:39,989 --> 00:13:44,459
It's got various tools and
customizations, and you can also do image

223
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:47,069
combinations combining images together.

224
00:13:47,569 --> 00:13:50,539
Moving on to LLexicaand Microsoft copilot.

225
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:53,339
So Microsoft Copilot, which is DALE 3.

226
00:13:53,359 --> 00:13:54,439
We're showing that here.

227
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:57,109
Lexica is a search engine now.

228
00:13:57,109 --> 00:13:59,359
It's got image generation tools.

229
00:13:59,389 --> 00:14:04,639
It's got a lot of ability to customize
things and look at the history

230
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:07,399
of images and adapt over time.

231
00:14:08,463 --> 00:14:09,763
Moving on to the last two.

232
00:14:09,763 --> 00:14:15,043
For the Japanese girl, we've got Leonardo
AI and Diffusion Bee, and at this point

233
00:14:15,043 --> 00:14:20,893
I was nearly giving up on Diffusion Bee,
but Leonardo is an incredibly powerful

234
00:14:20,923 --> 00:14:24,133
image generation and AI generation tool.

235
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:29,713
You've got capabilities like in
painting, out painting and magic erasers.

236
00:14:30,283 --> 00:14:34,543
You've got control net, which
gives intricate image guidance.

237
00:14:35,188 --> 00:14:38,728
The real time canvas allows
you to make modifications to

238
00:14:38,728 --> 00:14:40,828
the image quickly and easily.

239
00:14:41,636 --> 00:14:47,186
Now moving on to our last reference image,
which is a line coming out of the clouds.

240
00:14:47,426 --> 00:14:51,116
Now you might have noticed in the last
section that I talked a little bit

241
00:14:51,116 --> 00:14:55,886
more in detail about each of the image
generators, but I only did one of them.

242
00:14:56,156 --> 00:14:58,856
Now I'll do the other
half in this section.

243
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:02,146
So with the image, we've
dragged it into DALE 3.

244
00:15:02,576 --> 00:15:04,976
The original prompt was
actually quite simple.

245
00:15:04,976 --> 00:15:05,666
It was an.

246
00:15:05,891 --> 00:15:10,961
An angel lion emerging from ash, but
with the image being dragged into

247
00:15:10,961 --> 00:15:16,481
DALE 3, what we finally get is create
a powerful and dramatic illustration

248
00:15:16,481 --> 00:15:19,091
of a lion with angelic wings.

249
00:15:19,591 --> 00:15:23,401
Create a powerful and dramatic
illustration of a lion with angelic

250
00:15:23,401 --> 00:15:26,071
wings emerging from a cloud of ash.

251
00:15:26,251 --> 00:15:30,151
So this is the prompt we're going
to use for the 16 generators.

252
00:15:30,651 --> 00:15:36,021
So moving on to Night Cafe and Ideogram
in this particular case, I really love

253
00:15:36,021 --> 00:15:38,751
the image that Ideogram has created.

254
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,701
Night Cafe is not too bad.

255
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:44,571
Now, the thing about Ideogram
is it's a powerful tool.

256
00:15:44,571 --> 00:15:47,451
It's designed for both
amateurs and professionals.

257
00:15:47,951 --> 00:15:51,041
It's got preset image stars 3D rendering.

258
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:55,781
It's got community engagement and all
the sort of options editing that you

259
00:15:55,781 --> 00:15:58,091
would like to do, but additionally.

260
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:03,121
It's got a diverse range of
visual elements and icons.

261
00:16:03,121 --> 00:16:06,001
And the other thing that you can
do with it is work with text.

262
00:16:06,001 --> 00:16:11,761
So you can combine text, fonts, colors,
and different styles with the generation.

263
00:16:12,261 --> 00:16:15,771
Let's have a look at
open art and designs ai.

264
00:16:15,771 --> 00:16:18,711
We've got pretty good
images going on here.

265
00:16:18,921 --> 00:16:24,401
Designs AI is an interesting tool
developed by the Imagine Group.

266
00:16:24,431 --> 00:16:27,716
It's got a bunch of
makers, so it's got a text.

267
00:16:28,216 --> 00:16:32,896
It's got a logo maker, a video
maker, design maker, and speech

268
00:16:32,986 --> 00:16:38,116
maker, so something like the speech
maker can be used for voiceovers.

269
00:16:38,266 --> 00:16:41,056
The other thing it's got are
these pairers, so it's got

270
00:16:41,056 --> 00:16:43,756
font, pairer, and color matcher.

271
00:16:43,756 --> 00:16:47,356
So an interesting range of tools
with this particular product.

272
00:16:47,856 --> 00:16:50,946
Best we'll look at Blue
Willow and a Adobe Firefly.

273
00:16:51,156 --> 00:16:53,646
We've got two great
images going on here now.

274
00:16:53,646 --> 00:16:57,966
Adobe's going to be a really powerful
tool moving forward, so I guess its

275
00:16:57,971 --> 00:17:02,526
main competitor is Canva, but it
has the ability to integrate into

276
00:17:02,526 --> 00:17:04,596
the rest of the Adobe products.

277
00:17:04,926 --> 00:17:08,976
One of the things that's got is
this ethical ai, so it's all trained

278
00:17:08,976 --> 00:17:13,766
on images that it has the rights
to, and then being a design tool

279
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:16,986
has Generative fill and expand.

280
00:17:16,986 --> 00:17:18,906
you can also do veto graphics with it.

281
00:17:18,906 --> 00:17:21,636
move on to photo and crayon.

282
00:17:21,636 --> 00:17:26,736
Now, crayon has been a tool that I
didn't get a lot of success out of

283
00:17:26,736 --> 00:17:31,866
it, but it might still be a useful
tool for you to use for these reasons.

284
00:17:32,366 --> 00:17:37,226
It is a free tool and it has prompt
predictions and suggestions, and with

285
00:17:37,226 --> 00:17:40,826
a little bit of work, you can get an
image close to what you might want.

286
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:45,166
Next we'll look at Dream Studio
and Imagine Art, and they're

287
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:46,756
both producing great images.

288
00:17:46,756 --> 00:17:49,546
Now Imagine Art is a pretty powerful tool.

289
00:17:49,856 --> 00:17:55,156
it's got different styles, image
remixing, and advanced configuration.

290
00:17:55,186 --> 00:17:58,276
It can also do background
removal and in painting.

291
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:02,280
So we're looking at playground and
hotpot again, and these are now

292
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,189
becoming leading contenders for myself.

293
00:18:05,219 --> 00:18:07,409
But let's talk a little bit about hotpot.

294
00:18:07,415 --> 00:18:12,030
So it's quite a versatile tool that
you can use for image generation,

295
00:18:12,034 --> 00:18:17,960
but you can also use it for photo
editing, headshots, and avatars.

296
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:20,899
One of the other things
it can do is text writing.

297
00:18:21,395 --> 00:18:26,165
So you can use it for your brainstorming
and copywriting and like tools like

298
00:18:26,225 --> 00:18:31,865
Canva or Firefly, it has templates that
you can customize for social media.

299
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:32,470
I.

300
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:38,020
moving on to Lexica and Microsoft
Co-pilot, the Lexica image is really good.

301
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:42,700
The Microsoft Co-pilot for me is something
that you would use just the same way as

302
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:46,210
you would use DALE 3 within chat GPT.

303
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,890
Now, if you are using Microsoft Co-pilot,
you might not want to go any further

304
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:56,410
than this, and if you really wanna see
a great set of examples of MidJourney

305
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:01,000
versus what Microsoft Copilot could do,
you could check out the video that I've.

306
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:07,000
Did last year where I did 400 images,
50 prompts, four images per prompt

307
00:19:07,005 --> 00:19:11,170
for MidJourney, and four images per
prompt for DALE 3, where you can

308
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:15,610
get a good side by side comparison
between these two different products.

309
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:20,220
For the last two, Leonardo
AI and Diffusion Bee.

310
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:24,420
So the Leonardo image is pretty
good, the Diffusion Bee, the thing

311
00:19:24,425 --> 00:19:30,170
about this tool is that this image
that's done is okay and it's free.

312
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:34,370
It runs on your computer, so you
have a lot of capability to produce

313
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:39,500
images, but it doesn't necessarily
create the best results, but some

314
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,970
of the tools that are built into it.

315
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:45,230
Include in painting, out
painting and upscaling, and you

316
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:46,730
can plug different models in.

317
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:50,420
So if you know what you're doing, you
might be able to get this to a much

318
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:54,890
higher level of capability and just
run it locally on your Mac computer.

319
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:59,000
In the case of Diffusion Bee for
Windows, I'm sure there's a tool

320
00:19:59,005 --> 00:20:00,620
