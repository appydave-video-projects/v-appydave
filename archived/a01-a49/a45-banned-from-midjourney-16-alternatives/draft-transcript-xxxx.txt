Are you someone who loves mid journey but recently got banned, hi I'm AppyDave and last week I got banned from mid journey having used it for the last 18 months.

In this video, I'm going to talk about the issue that I'm experiencing how I think it occurred and what is The alternative to mid journey that I can use.



Do you love Midjourney because of the stunning AI art it creates? And just like me, you suddenly received the notification that your account is BANNED.

Hi, I’m AppyDave. In this video, I’ll share my frustrating experience after I got banned from Midjourney and how I searched for other alternatives for this AI Art Generator.

I've been using Midjourney since March 2023. And less than a month ago, I even invested in a whole year's subscription for $220.  Then I suddenly received a notification that my account was banned.
