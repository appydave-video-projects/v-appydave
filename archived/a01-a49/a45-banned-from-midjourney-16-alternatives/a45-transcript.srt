1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,760
I had a wonderful relationship with Mid Journey. 

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:08,300
We've shared many experiences and created a lot of memories over the last 12 months. 

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,740
And even one month ago, I renewed our commitment costing $300. 

4
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:18,780
So I was shot, dismayed and a little bit angry when I found myself banned 

5
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:23,120
and when I tried to communicate with them to find out what had happened to our relationship, 

6
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:24,800
they just ghosted me. 

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,660
Hi, I'm Api Dave and I'm going to share what happened. 

8
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:33,900
The ban that I got, the $300 that I lost, what I believe is a misdiagnosis 

9
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,980
and the frustration that I had dealing with Mid Journey support. 

10
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,620
And then after that, I'm going to show you 16 beautiful alternatives to Mid Journey. 

11
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,200
I've been using Mid Journey since March last year 

12
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,740
and I've created thousands of images that I've used a lot within my YouTube videos. 

13
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:57,760
But last year, I did end up switching a fair bit over to Dali 3 

14
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,060
mainly because I found it easier to work with within ChatGPT 

15
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:07,020
and I'd already done a video showcasing 200 image comparisons 

16
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,500
between the two different products across 50 prompts. 

17
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:17,020
And in my opinion, Dali 3, while not as good as Mid Journey, was a worthy contender. 

18
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,420
Last month, I was talking at a tech summit and I needed some pretty good images 

19
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:26,680
for the presentation I was doing so I ended up reactivating my Mid Journey account. 

20
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,740
Now, one week later, I found myself having to upgrade 

21
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,360
because I'd used up all the credits that I had there 

22
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,260
and I ended up spending $288. 

23
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,100
But it was great because the images I was able to generate 

24
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,260
for the tech summit presentation were just wonderful. 

25
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,220
Now, two weeks ago, I moved to countries. 

26
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,380
I came over to Thailand and not long after arriving, 

27
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:53,780
I started getting this particular error, creation failed on my Mid Journey account. 

28
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:58,380
I headed over to Discord and saw this error that's saying 

29
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:05,200
accessing our services via automation, scripting, or third-party tools created a ban. 

30
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:09,380
Now, I started doing a bit of research to figure out what was going on 

31
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:12,940
because I hadn't done any automation or third-party scripting 

32
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:18,080
and people had come up with these issues banned due to billing not matching the home address. 

33
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,900
Okay, not my situation. 

34
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:25,720
Someone has talked about losing a $60 subscription and not being refunded. 

35
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:30,040
My situation is $288 because I spent it for a full year 

36
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,160
and I haven't been refunded either. 

37
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,240
Then we saw other sorts of issues with banning going on 

38
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,940
and then this next one gave me a little bit of a clue to what might be the issue. 

39
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:44,940
This includes IP and email bans from Discord. 

40
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,520
I headed over to an email and I wrote, I can't sign into Mid Journey. 

41
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,820
I've checked the images. 

42
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,900
There's nothing that meets the fraud or the other issues that they listed. 

43
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,340
I'm an influencer and basically all the images that I do for YouTube 

44
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:06,240
and that's important to understand because you can't do bad quality images on YouTube 

45
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,360
and get away with it. 

46
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,820
And what happened was I got this reply straight away from them 

47
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:15,820
saying severe repeated violations of terms and services, 

48
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:21,260
use of automation, scripting, APIs, engaging in reselling services. 

49
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,340
So none of this stuff was going on for me. 

50
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,620
And then we had this one. 

51
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,960
You should have received notifications in Discord informing you of this 

52
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:33,020
that they would have appeared that you've interacted with a bot 

53
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,060
and copies should have been sent to you. 

54
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,320
Now I've not received a direct message regarding that 

55
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,700
so I'm not sure what's going on. 

56
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:43,720
The other thing that they've stated here is as per the terms and conditions 

57
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,060
refunds are not issued on banned accounts. 

58
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,760
So I thought, okay, where do I go now? 

59
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,960
So as I reviewed the forums again, it got me thinking about this IP address ban 

60
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,220
and the reason it got me thinking about it is that a year and a half ago 

61
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,700
I came to Chiang Mai for six months 

62
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:05,220
and while I was here, I signed up to an American e-commerce platform. 

63
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,520
About two weeks later, they sent me an email saying that I'd been banned 

64
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,960
and that I'd been banned for life. 

65
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,520
I could not get an account again. 

66
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,640
And I ended up in that particular situation 

67
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:19,780
sending details of my passport and my bank account details 

68
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:23,680
and then finally enough four months later when I was back in Australia 

69
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,280
I got a reversal. 

70
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:28,340
So that was a misdiagnosis going on. 

71
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:33,940
Now two weeks ago, I found myself moving again back to Chiang Mai 

72
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,020
and I was going via the Philippines. 

73
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:40,220
So the three places that I find myself in are Australia 

74
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,800
where I'm either in Sydney or Brisbane. 

75
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,740
I find myself in Philippines and I find myself in Thailand. 

76
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,160
I ended up sending a reply email to mid-journey stating 

77
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,240
that I hadn't violated any terms or conditions that I was aware of 

78
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,840
and that I travel and that means that I open on different computers 

79
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,820
with different IPs, my mid-journey account 

80
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,100
and all they did was reply stating 

81
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:08,100
we can't provide you with any additional information about your ban. 

82
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,680
Banned users are not eligible for a refund. 

83
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,700
So to be honest, I was a bit gutted by all of that 

84
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:19,040
and quite angry that I'd spent money only about three weeks earlier 

85
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:24,640
and it was all lost and they won't even do the courtesy of communicating with me about it. 

86
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,660
Rather than get caught up in the resentment of dealing with mid-journey support 

87
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:31,580
what I thought is it's time for a new relationship 

88
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:36,800
and the good thing is there are many great alternatives out there at the moment. 

89
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:41,760
So what we're going to do is look at 16 different AI art generators 

90
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,940
and we're going to use three images that I've used in the past. 

91
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:49,220
I've created these in mid-journey, I've used them in my videos 

92
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:54,280
and with each of them we're going to run them through the 16 AI art generators. 

93
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,900
We are going to need a prompt. 

94
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:00,580
So what I thought I'd do is take each of the individual images 

95
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,500
and we'll drag them straight into Dali 3. 

96
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,780
Once they're in Dali 3 we can actually ask Dali 3 to tell us what the image is about 

97
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:14,700
but I'll give it a little bit extra context by giving it the original mid-journey prompt as well 

98
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:19,340
and then when we run it through Dali 3 we get a prompt like this. 

99
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:26,700
So in this particular case it's create an animated illustration of a smiling 30 year old blond man with eyeglasses 

100
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:32,220
and then a bit later on it says the style should be similar to modern animated illustrations 

101
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,140
with a clean and simple design. 

102
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,980
And what we'll do is we'll take that prompt and the reference image 

103
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:42,020
and we're just going to run it through all 16 AI art generators. 

104
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,620
So the first two we'll look at is Night Cafe and Idiogram. 

105
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:52,040
Now Night Cafe has a nice clean user interface where you can select different styles 

106
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:58,560
whereas Idiogram is really good at doing symbolic art and Idiograms. 

107
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,900
We've got two images here, they're looking pretty clean to me. 

108
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:06,240
Next we'll look at OpenArt and Designs AI. 

109
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,620
So OpenArt has the ability to use multiple models. 

110
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,800
I think it has something like a hundred different models that you can use. 

111
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:19,560
Designs AI can be used for images but it can also be used for logos and videos as well. 

112
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:25,960
Next to our Blue Willow which is by Lime Wire and a Dope Firefly. 

113
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:30,360
They're both producing really great images, we would expect that from a Dope 

114
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,200
but this Blue Willow product is also pretty good. 

115
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,460
I'd better mention too that we have a Dope Firefly, it's like canvas 

116
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:42,580
so you have the ability to do a lot of other design tooling with that product. 

117
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:48,300
And that then brings us onto Photor and Crayon and Photor is an interesting one 

118
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,980
because it's a graphics editing software. 

119
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,620
And their implementation of generative art is pretty good I think. 

120
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:01,000
Then we've got Crayon which I had a lot of trouble trying to get good images from it. 

121
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:07,080
So this is the first time we've come across an AI art generator that wouldn't compare to mid-journey 

122
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,840
but everything else has been pretty good so far. 

123
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:13,700
Next we have Dream Studio and Imagine. 

124
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:19,340
And Dream Studio has the ability to have multiple models as well that you can select from 

125
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:23,420
and Imagine Art is a detailed illustration tool. 

126
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,800
Both of these are producing great images. 

127
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,500
Next we're looking at Playground and Hotpot. 

128
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:36,320
Now Playground has advanced editing features while Hotpot also has some editing capabilities. 

129
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:42,100
One of the things I noticed with this particular image is that to me it didn't feel like 

130
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:47,280
the illustration style that was described in the prompt but they're still great images. 

131
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,520
The next two to look at is Lexico and Microsoft Copilot. 

132
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,600
And Lexico in the past has been an AI art search engine. 

133
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,800
It's a great place to get inspiration but they also have creation tools. 

134
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:05,360
And we've used them here and this is a tool I do want to deep dive into and there will be a video on that. 

135
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,260
As for Microsoft Copilot it's essentially Dali 3. 

136
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:12,540
So whatever you're doing in ChatGPT you can do here as well. 

137
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,160
The last two in the list are Worlds Apart. 

138
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,160
So we've got Leonardo AI and Diffusion B. 

139
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:24,560
Now Leonardo AI has a lot of advanced tooling and creativity that you can do within it. 

140
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,460
Diffusion B on the other hand is a local computer implementation. 

141
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:32,900
So in my case it's running on the Mac and it is a stable diffusion. 

142
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:37,140
And I wasn't really able to get any good images out of this particular model. 

143
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:43,660
So for the prompt of the 30 year old man creative animated illustration 

144
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:46,020
we've got 16 different variations here. 

145
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:51,700
And there are plenty of great contenders to go up against mid-journey in this particular case. 

146
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:55,480
What we'll do now is we'll move on to the next reference image 

147
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,320
and I'll give you a little bit more detail about each of these applications as we go. 

148
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,580
We'll start by dragging the reference image over into Dali 3. 

149
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:06,660
We'll also use the original prompt from mid-journey 

150
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:10,340
which had things like their style, raw, stylized 500. 

151
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:14,760
Now this won't be able to be used effectively in the other art generators. 

152
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,820
So the generation of the prompt is here. 

153
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:22,640
Creative realistic illustration of a woman in a 30 shown inside profile. 

154
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,900
And we get all that information and this is what we're going to feed into the 16 AI art generators. 

155
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,320
Moving over to the final overview with this reference image 

156
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,480
we've again got a lot of great examples. 

157
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:39,240
Now if there's a particular tool that you want me to do a deep dive in, let me know. 

158
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:44,900
Now I am going to do a two or three minute video on pretty much everything that's here 

159
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:51,020
but there are a couple here that I'm going to use professionally with my YouTube videos 

160
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:53,940
and they're the ones that I'm going to deep dive into. 

161
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:57,480
So let me know which ones you're interested in and I'll do a video on them. 

162
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,720
Now the first example we've got here is Night Cafe and Idiogram 

163
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,880
and both images are pretty good in my opinion. 

164
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,520
Let's talk a little bit about Night Cafe. 

165
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,940
This tool you can use stable diffusion or Dali 3. 

166
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:17,280
You've also got access to print on demand and can select different art styles. 

167
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:22,020
I'll tell you more about Idiogram when we look at the third reference image 

168
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:25,680
but moving on we can look at open art and design AI. 

169
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:33,020
We've got interesting styles, maybe the one from Designs AI isn't as good as the mid-journey one 

170
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:36,160
but the open art one is quite impressive. 

171
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,540
The thing about this particular tool is that apart from image generation 

172
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:45,540
it's pretty good with anime characters and it's also got an image upscaler. 

173
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,460
Moving on to Blue Willow and a Dive Firefly. 

174
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:51,080
Blue Willow is great as a tool. 

175
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,980
It has many different styles that you can work from. 

176
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:58,600
It's got some tools like background removers, blurs, 3D models 

177
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,380
and one of its key advantages is that it's quick at generating images. 

178
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:07,560
Let's now have a look at Photor and Crayon. 

179
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:12,700
Now Crayon like before doesn't really do a great job of generating images 

180
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:17,920
but Photor is really interesting because not only is it generating a good image 

181
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,880
but it's a really powerful tool. 

182
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:26,300
We've got photo enhancement like upscaling background removal in painting. 

183
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:30,640
It's also got realistic human face generation 

184
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:36,200
so it can do things like skin tones, hair, accessories, those sorts of features 

185
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:40,840
which are really hard to do with general tools like mid-journey. 

186
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,760
It's got all the different styles of art that you might want to do 

187
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:48,000
which you would expect from a lot of the image generations 

188
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,300
but it can also do transforms from one style to another. 

189
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:56,660
Overall if you want image generation but you also want image editing 

190
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,880
this might be a great tool to look at. 

191
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,640
Moving on to Dream Studio and Imagine. 

192
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:06,420
We've got good images being generated based on the prompt. 

193
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,420
Let's talk about Dream Studio. 

194
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:12,820
It's both stability AI using the stable diffusion model. 

195
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:16,380
Now it's got all your text to image sort of capabilities. 

196
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:21,260
It can also do image to image so you can take an image and alter it. 

197
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:24,780
And it's got capabilities like image upscaling. 

198
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,060
Looking now at playground and hot pot. 

199
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,780
So in this case the images are pretty good. 

200
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,020
The playground has this really nice user interface 

201
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:37,700
and a very generous usage limit on a daily basis. 

202
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,680
It uses different models. 

203
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,420
It's got various tools and customizations 

204
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:46,780
and you can also do image combinations combining images together. 

205
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:50,340
Moving on to Let'ssica and Microsoft Co-Pilot. 

206
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:53,100
So Microsoft Co-Pilot which is Dali 3. 

207
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,180
We're showing that here. 

208
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,680
Let'ssica is a search engine. 

209
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,940
Now it's got image generation tools. 

210
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,600
It's got a lot of ability to customize things 

211
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:07,160
and look at the history of images and adapt them over time. 

212
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,660
Moving on to the last two for the Japanese girl. 

213
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,460
We've got Leonardo AI and Diffusion B. 

214
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,140
And at this point I was nearly giving up on Diffusion B. 

215
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:23,860
But Leonardo is an incredibly powerful image generation and AI generation tool. 

216
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:29,380
You've got capabilities like in-painting, out-painting and magic erasers. 

217
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,980
You've got Control Net which gives intricate image guidance. 

218
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:38,100
And the real-time canvas allows you to make modifications 

219
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,880
to the image quickly and easily. 

220
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:44,240
Now moving on to our last reference image 

221
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,860
which is a line coming out of the clouds. 

222
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,260
Now you might have noticed in the last section 

223
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:54,260
that I talked a little bit more in detail about each of the image generators 

224
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,740
but I only did one of them. 

225
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:58,580
Now I'll do the other half in this section. 

226
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,880
So with the image we've dragged it into Dali 3. 

227
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,740
The original prompt was actually quite simple. 

228
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:08,600
It was an angel lion emerging from ash. 

229
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,460
But with the image being dragged into Dali 3, 

230
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:16,140
what we finally get is create a powerful and dramatic illustration 

231
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:18,540
of a lion with angelic wings. 

232
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,280
Create a powerful and dramatic illustration of a lion 

233
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,780
with angelic wings emerging from a cloud of ash. 

234
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,860
So this is the prompt we're going to use for the 16 generators. 

235
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:33,320
So moving on to Night Cafe and Idiogram. 

236
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:38,480
In this particular case I really love the image that Idiogram has created. 

237
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,500
Night Cafe is not too bad. 

238
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,380
Now the thing about Idiogram is it's a powerful tool. 

239
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:47,000
It's designed for both amateurs and professionals. 

240
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,660
It's got preset image stars, 3D rendering. 

241
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:54,540
It's got community engagement and all the sort of options 

242
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,320
editing that you would like to do. 

243
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:01,300
But additionally, it's got a diverse range of visual elements 

244
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,540
and icons. 

245
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,620
And the other thing that you can do with it is work with text. 

246
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:09,180
So you can combine text, fonts, colours 

247
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,460
and different styles with the generation. 

248
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:15,300
So let's have a look at OpenArt and Designs AI. 

249
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,500
We've got pretty good images going on here. 

250
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,560
Designs AI is an interesting tool. 

251
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:25,880
Developed by the Imagine group, it's got a bunch of makers. 

252
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,840
So it's got a text. 

253
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:33,240
It's got a logo maker, a video maker, design maker and speech maker. 

254
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:37,820
So something like the speech maker can be used for voiceovers. 

255
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,160
The other thing it's got are these peras. 

256
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,640
So it's got font pera and colour matcher. 

257
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:47,080
So an interesting range of tools with this particular product. 

258
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:50,640
Next we'll look at Blue Willow and Adobe Firefly. 

259
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,220
We've got two great images going on here. 

260
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,740
Now Adobe's going to be a really powerful tool moving forward. 

261
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,700
So I guess its main competitor is Canva. 

262
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:04,320
But it has the ability to integrate into the rest of the Adobe products. 

263
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:07,320
One of the things it's got is this ethical AI. 

264
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:11,220
So it's all trained on images that it has the rights to. 

265
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:16,420
And then being a design tool, it has generative fill and expand. 

266
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,740
You can also do vector graphics with it. 

267
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,380
Move on to Photo and Crayon. 

268
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:26,800
Now Crayon has been a tool that I didn't get a lot of success out of it. 

269
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,500
But it might still be a useful tool for you to use for these reasons. 

270
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:36,320
It is a free tool and it has prompt predictions and suggestions. 

271
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:40,620
And with a little bit of work, you can get an image close to what you might want. 

272
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,260
Next we'll look at Dream Studio and Imagine Art. 

273
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,460
And they're both producing great images. 

274
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,260
Now Imagine Art is a pretty powerful tool. 

275
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:54,700
It's got different styles, image remixing and advanced configuration. 

276
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,100
It can also do background removal and in painting. 

277
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,940
So we're looking at Playground and Hotpot again. 

278
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,700
And these are now becoming leading contenders for myself. 

279
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,160
But let's talk a little bit about Hotpot. 

280
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,540
So it's quite a versatile tool that you can use for image generation. 

281
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:17,680
But you can also use it for photo editing, headshots and avatars. 

282
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,660
One of the other things it can do is text writing. 

283
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,260
So you can use it for your brainstorming and copywriting. 

284
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:31,540
And like tools like Canva or Firefly, it has templates that you can customize for social media. 

285
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,380
Moving on to Let's Secure and Microsoft Co-Pilot. 

286
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,780
The Let's Secure image is really good. 

287
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:43,080
The Microsoft Co-Pilot for me is something that you would use just the same way she would use 

288
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,880
Dali 3 within ChatGPT. 

289
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:51,260
Now if you're using Microsoft Co-Pilot, you might not want to go any further than this. 

290
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:58,860
And if you really want to see a great set of examples of mid-journey versus what Microsoft Co-Pilot could do, 

291
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:03,560
you can check out the video that I did last year where I did 400 images, 

292
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:10,300
50 prompts, 4 images per prompt for mid-journey and 4 images per prompt for Dali 3. 

293
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:15,260
Where you can get a good side-by-side comparison between these two different products. 

294
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:19,960
And for the last two, Leonardo AI and Diffusion B. 

295
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,140
So the Leonardo image is pretty good. 

296
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:28,220
The Diffusion B, the thing about this tool is that this image it's done is okay. 

297
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,520
And it's free. It runs on your computer. 

298
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:38,760
So you have a lot of capability to produce images, but it doesn't necessarily create the best results. 

299
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:44,620
But some of the tools that are built into it include in-painting, out-painting and upscaling. 

300
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,540
And you can plug different models in. 

301
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,760
So if you know what you're doing, you might be able to get this to a much higher level of capability 

302
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,760
and just run it locally on your Mac computer in the case of Diffusion B. 

303
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:00,320
For Windows, I'm sure there's a tool that does something very similar. 

304
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:05,340
So there's 16 great examples of the line coming out of the ashes. 

305
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:09,860
We've also got the lady in her house Japanese background. 

306
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:15,940
And the man in his 30s illustration style yellow background with his thumbs up. 

307
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:19,660
So even though I've been banned from mid-journey, it's unfortunate. 

308
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,060
I wish they would look into the case. 

309
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:26,260
I've found that there are 16 awesome alternatives out there. 

310
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,300
So please like and subscribe. 

311
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:34,100
And if you're interested in videos about prompt engineering or AI, 

312
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,900
then let me know in the comments below. 

313
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,400
Otherwise, I'll see you in the next video. 

314
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:40,500
Have a great day. 

315
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,100
I'm Happy Dave. 

316
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:41,380
I'm Happy Dave.
