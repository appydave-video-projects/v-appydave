## Transcript

Is there a GPT that will write an outro to a video that recaps, creates engagement or
directs viewers to more of your content?
Continuing our journey in YouTube automation.
Today I'm showcasing the YouTube outro writer found in the GPT store.
This tool is about creating powerful endings that resonate with your audience and strengthen
your brand.
Looking at the YouTube outro generator, the main role is that it can create an engaging
outro for your video.
Now the overview suggests that it's about creating viewer engagement.
You want people to like and subscribe to do comments.
Maybe you want them to click on an end card and go to one of your other videos.
Like the previous agent, the outro creator has a configure command where you can put
the capability that you want to see within the outro.
And the main ones that I like to use is a call to action, maybe like and subscribe.
I definitely like to do a recap of the video and have some sort of video end card that
people can click on to go to related content.
And you can do that all through the configuration before you worry about creating the outro.
We'll come over to the GPTs and we'll click on the Tube outro writer, craft engaging
outros for YouTube videos based on summaries and settings.
And we can have a look at what commands we've got available.
We can do a configuration, create an outro or look at the capabilities and we'll just
run that one command.
We're not going to give it any input, we'll just see what it comes up with.
So we have a pretty extensive list, call to actions, end cards and you could configure
each of these pieces of information, but we'll go for something quite simple.
We'll just go brevity and thanks.
So I'll put in config with brevity, thanks with like and subscribe.
I also added a configuration for apicast.
At this point we can just do a create and do a paste.
And what I've done is like before I've included the title of the video and then the full
transcript in this case, you can do it with both transcripts and summaries.
I find for this one I like to do the full transcript.
So it's gone through and created everything that we wanted.
I will read it in a moment, but what I'd like it to do is just the script.
In this case, it's also given a few extra instructions that could be useful for the
video editor, but I just want to read it.
So what we got was that's wrap on our scripting adventure with Shell Script Helper.
So it understands the context of the video.
Big thanks for joining us on this journey to simplify Shell scripting with GPT technology.
If you loved diving into the tech with us, show your support by hitting the like and
subscribe to apicast.
So this is basically following the guidelines that we did when we configured the capabilities.
Thank you for joining me in this look at one of the GPTs I used to streamline
content creation on YouTube.
