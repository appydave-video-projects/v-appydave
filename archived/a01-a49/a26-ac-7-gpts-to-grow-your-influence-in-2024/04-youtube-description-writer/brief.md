## Transcript

I wish I could simplify writing descriptions for YouTube videos.
I find the process of writing SEO friendly video summaries with subtle branding messages,
keywords and calls to action, or locating and adding appropriate video affiliate or
social links to be time-consuming. In this installment of GPT's that automate your
YouTube influence, we are looking at the YouTube description writer found in the GPT store.
Let's dive into SEO friendly descriptions that enhance content visibility and engagement.
The next agent we're going to look at is around the publishing of your YouTube video where you've
got to fill in information like the description and the keywords. Let's take a look at the
description from a video I did a week ago and the video is called build YouTube automation
app with chat GPT. And the way it starts is join me in the first episode of build a YouTube
automation app with chat GPT. So it's written an intro here in the description that matches the
title. From there we have four sections. We've got what's inside, episode highlights, useful links
including affiliate links and stay tuned for more. And it finishes off with a bunch of keywords.
Let's take a look at the GPT agent for YouTube description writing. And the role of this agent
is to craft engaging and informative YouTube video descriptions. The basic overview of this
is that it specializes in creating YouTube descriptions for videos focusing on SEO view
engagement and compliance within the YouTube guidelines. So with the additional guidelines
around hashtags, links and discoverability, we should be able to start using this GPT to
create a new description. The primary command for this particular GPT is create. And usually I would
provide it with a title and a summary. I might also have some special instructions if I need it.
And I often include extra metadata such as affiliate links or branding links to my social
media channels. Heading over to my GPTs we've got a video description wizard which is a friendly
yet professional YouTube description expert focusing on SEO engagement and compliance.
And what we'll do is we'll click on the I will give you a title, transcript and special instructions
at the moment it's just waiting for input. Select the analysis and the summary as we scroll up this
also the intro that was used in this video and the title. And we'll take it a little bit further
and just copy the brand details and just put that into the clipboard.
Type in the word create with a colon and just paste everything that we've selected and see
what it creates. It's got a title which has unlocked the power of GPTs and then we move
into the description. So I would be copying from this little emoji all the way down what you'll
discover key highlights and stay connected through some social media channels. There's
a call to action to like share and subscribe and following up with some keywords.
