00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,530
Welcome to the Future of YouTube in 2024.

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:08,119
I'm excited to unveil seven Custom
GPTs designed to transform your

3
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:12,530
YouTube channel and introduce the GPT
store that makes all this possible.

4
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:17,560
Discover how these GPTs revolutionize
content creation with stunning

5
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:22,240
B roll, engaging outros and SEO
enhanced YouTube descriptions.

6
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,030
We'll also highlight three social
sharing GPTs to boost your digital reach.

7
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:32,960
Let's delve into how GPT is set to
reshape content creation in 2024.

8
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:38,050
Hi, I'm AppyDave, and the intro you
just heard was created by one of

9
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,980
the GPTs coming up in this video,
but we'll get into that later.

10
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:42,599
I.

11
00:00:43,035 --> 00:00:47,925
When you open up the chat GPT store,
you have access to GPTs created

12
00:00:47,925 --> 00:00:50,355
by open AI and by other people.

13
00:00:50,845 --> 00:00:55,224
Let's head over to my GPTs and you'll
see that there's a bunch that I've

14
00:00:55,224 --> 00:00:59,684
created and many of these are related
to YouTube content automation.

15
00:01:00,184 --> 00:01:05,374
What I'll cover in this video are seven
different GPTs that I use after I've

16
00:01:05,374 --> 00:01:10,264
recorded the bulk of the content, and
that includes the intro and outro script,

17
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:15,065
B-roll, which is about generating images
that match the words that I'm saying.

18
00:01:15,565 --> 00:01:19,405
There'll be the YouTube description
writer, which creates a really nice

19
00:01:19,465 --> 00:01:24,355
SEO friendly YouTube description
with affiliate links, social links,

20
00:01:24,355 --> 00:01:26,455
and key highlights pulled out of it.

21
00:01:26,955 --> 00:01:31,634
Then lastly, I need to share the
videos that I do, and I use LinkedIn,

22
00:01:31,634 --> 00:01:35,774
Facebook, and Twitter, and these
bots will be designed to generate

23
00:01:35,835 --> 00:01:40,395
content or posts that make sense
for each of the different platforms.

24
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:45,144
Before going into detail on the seven
YouTube automation bots, there's one other

25
00:01:45,144 --> 00:01:47,214
bot that we should have a look at First.

26
00:01:47,714 --> 00:01:53,364
Whenever I create my YouTube intro or the
SEO friendly description, or maybe even

27
00:01:53,364 --> 00:01:58,734
the daily three B-roll images, I like
to create everything based off exactly

28
00:01:58,734 --> 00:02:01,274
what I said in the video and the script.

29
00:02:01,274 --> 00:02:06,760
abridger is an expert in summarizing
transcriptions and making abridgement.

30
00:02:07,004 --> 00:02:11,625
If we click on the commands, basically
there are two concepts that I like

31
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:13,575
to get out of a full transcription.

32
00:02:14,075 --> 00:02:17,615
Going into detail, the role of
this bot is to summarize and

33
00:02:17,615 --> 00:02:19,565
condense video transcriptions.

34
00:02:19,745 --> 00:02:23,735
Now it can use natural language
processing to extract structural

35
00:02:23,735 --> 00:02:28,895
information from a transcript, or it can
summarize it without losing the detail.

36
00:02:29,395 --> 00:02:33,955
What this means is I can take a 30
minute video that I've recorded and

37
00:02:33,955 --> 00:02:38,215
summarize it from, say a few thousand
words, down to a couple a hundred.

38
00:02:38,455 --> 00:02:43,195
Now, it can do it either as a summary
where it condenses, but keeps the meaning,

39
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:47,545
or it can do it as an analysis where
it gives more of a structural point

40
00:02:47,545 --> 00:02:52,495
of view, and both of these sorts of
outputs can be useful for future bots.

41
00:02:52,995 --> 00:02:54,035
Say an example.

42
00:02:54,035 --> 00:02:59,645
Let's take this 200 lines of
transcript from a 30 minute video

43
00:02:59,645 --> 00:03:00,995
that I did earlier in the week.

44
00:03:01,495 --> 00:03:05,755
If we compare everything side by side,
you can see what the full transcript

45
00:03:05,815 --> 00:03:10,075
over here on the left is 2,330 words.

46
00:03:10,255 --> 00:03:14,545
Now, if we go over to the summary,
it basically says close to the same

47
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:17,725
thing, and it does it in 127 words.

48
00:03:17,965 --> 00:03:22,585
There's also the analysis, which gives
more of a structural view of what the

49
00:03:22,585 --> 00:03:26,035
document has, and it's in 270 words.

50
00:03:26,535 --> 00:03:30,619
Now both the analysis and the
summarization of the transcript make

51
00:03:30,619 --> 00:03:35,359
for really useful inputs into other
bots that might generate a description

52
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:40,489
or generate graphics for an intro, and
it's as simple to use as typing over

53
00:03:40,489 --> 00:03:45,109
the summarize or the analysis command
pasting in your long form transcript,

54
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:47,569
and then just letting GPT do its work.

55
00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:52,189
as it goes, we can see that this
video features a scripting enthusiast

56
00:03:52,339 --> 00:03:56,749
demonstrating the use of a custom
GPT agent, the shell script helper.

57
00:03:57,249 --> 00:04:02,049
As we move through the seven YouTube
automation GPTs, we're going to find

58
00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:06,819
that the summary or the analysis of
the transcription, it's going to play

59
00:04:06,824 --> 00:04:08,559
an important role for each of 'em.

60
00:04:09,059 --> 00:04:12,809
The test case for each of the bots
that we're working with today will be

61
00:04:12,809 --> 00:04:14,789
around the Shell Script helper video.

62
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:19,159
Now, this video came out a couple
of days ago and a few things

63
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:20,779
to note as you look through it.

64
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:25,719
Is that there's a detailed SEO
friendly YouTube description with

65
00:04:25,719 --> 00:04:28,990
keywords and links to various assets.

66
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:33,640
If we scroll down and click on the
transcript, you'll see that there's an

67
00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:36,280
intro that was written by one of the bots.

68
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:40,710
We'll look at how I use GPT
to generate YouTube titles.

69
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:45,530
But also look at the text that it
can create to go on a thumbnail,

70
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:49,010
which is quite a bit different
to the text in a YouTube title.

71
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:52,880
We'll also look at the Dali three
images that can be generated or what I

72
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,859
would call elements of the thumbnail.

73
00:04:55,359 --> 00:05:00,429
And if I get a chance, I'll even touch
on how Dali three instructions can be

74
00:05:00,429 --> 00:05:05,529
generated directly off the transcript
to produce B-roll images that look

75
00:05:05,529 --> 00:05:07,449
exactly like what you're talking about.

76
00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:12,859
Most of the videos I create are from
five to 25 minutes in length and once

77
00:05:12,859 --> 00:05:17,219
recorded, I take the transcription and
I put it through the transcript abridger

78
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:20,086
to get my summary and an analysis.

79
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:24,826
From there, I then go and generate a
YouTube title using a chat GPT bot.

80
00:05:25,326 --> 00:05:29,106
That preliminary work out of
the road, I'm then in a position

81
00:05:29,106 --> 00:05:31,386
to create my YouTube intro.

82
00:05:31,656 --> 00:05:34,746
And to do that, I use the
YouTube intro generator.

83
00:05:35,246 --> 00:05:39,776
Now, the role of this bot is to
generate tailored YouTube intros.

84
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:44,126
The overview is that it can work
with a transcript directly, or it can

85
00:05:44,126 --> 00:05:46,376
work with a summary or an analysis.

86
00:05:46,876 --> 00:05:50,866
the main guidelines is that it
creates concise, informative,

87
00:05:50,896 --> 00:05:52,546
and compelling intros.

88
00:05:53,046 --> 00:05:57,966
The marketing frameworks, which in this
case are either PAS or AIDA, are really

89
00:05:57,966 --> 00:06:02,796
just psychological triggers to get people
engaged with your content pretty early.

90
00:06:03,006 --> 00:06:07,686
So we've got the problem agitate solution
framework, or we've got the attention,

91
00:06:07,716 --> 00:06:10,086
interest desire action framework.

92
00:06:10,356 --> 00:06:14,756
Now, from a structure point of view,
we have concepts like problem solution,

93
00:06:14,756 --> 00:06:18,656
which is one of the ones I like to
use, where there is a problem and I've

94
00:06:18,656 --> 00:06:20,666
got a solution that I've de developed.

95
00:06:20,976 --> 00:06:24,756
I'm also fond of the Q and A
style, but other people might

96
00:06:24,756 --> 00:06:26,976
like more of a storytelling style.

97
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:31,959
And the idea of the bot is that you would
configure it with the niche, the topic,

98
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:36,619
which might just be your YouTube title
some keywords, and then basically the

99
00:06:36,619 --> 00:06:41,949
marketing framework and structure that
you want using this sort of configuration.

100
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:45,579
And the transcript helps
you then generate the intro.

101
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:51,839
Over to my GPTs, and we'll click
on the intro maker, create engaging

102
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:54,899
educational YouTube intros, and
we'll just click on the commands

103
00:06:54,899 --> 00:06:56,369
to see what we've got available.

104
00:06:56,869 --> 00:06:58,669
And you can see, we can configure it.

105
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:01,159
We can create an intro based off a draft.

106
00:07:01,369 --> 00:07:05,029
We can also get some definitions
around the marketing framework and

107
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:06,919
the intro structures if you need.

108
00:07:07,419 --> 00:07:09,309
So I've just put in the config command.

109
00:07:09,309 --> 00:07:11,619
I've said ChatGPT for coding.

110
00:07:11,619 --> 00:07:13,329
That's what the video
happened to be about.

111
00:07:13,539 --> 00:07:17,559
The PAS marketing framework,
Q&A style, and let's just see

112
00:07:17,559 --> 00:07:18,729
what this comes back with.

113
00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:24,209
So this is working on the idea that
the niche will be ChatGPT for coding.

114
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:29,309
She the problem agitation, solution
framework, Q and A structure.

115
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:33,509
The tone will be authoritative and
engaging and you can run a configure.

116
00:07:33,629 --> 00:07:37,859
Command again, if you wanna change
what it says here, but for that,

117
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:42,569
we can now move on to create and we
just type in, create like this, press

118
00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:46,469
colon, and then we paste in all the
information from the transcription.

119
00:07:46,829 --> 00:07:51,149
I also like to put in the title, so
the title should be there as well.

120
00:07:51,509 --> 00:07:56,129
We got title, unlock the Power of
GPTs, and we just press enter and we

121
00:07:56,129 --> 00:07:58,619
see what we get on the first attempt.

122
00:07:59,119 --> 00:08:03,289
It's written an introduction for us,
and the one that's here is hello and

123
00:08:03,289 --> 00:08:06,890
welcome to today's video where we're
unlocking the incredible potential

124
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:09,890
of GPTs focusing on a unique tool.

125
00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:14,239
The shell script helper for ChatGPT,
and then it goes on from there.

126
00:08:14,739 --> 00:08:18,129
Now the intro it's created in
this example is quite accurate,

127
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:22,809
but it's also way longer than I
would want to do for an intro.

128
00:08:23,309 --> 00:08:26,309
We have a little bit of
configuration with that GPT agent.

129
00:08:26,309 --> 00:08:30,869
You can get an intro that follows
the style and pattern that you want.

130
00:08:30,929 --> 00:08:33,959
And the one I went for that video
was, do you wanna simplify the

131
00:08:33,964 --> 00:08:36,029
way you build terminal scripts?

132
00:08:36,089 --> 00:08:39,899
Join me on this unique scripting
adventure where I'll be using

133
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:42,459
custom GPT shell script helper.

134
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:47,439
So this little intro, it's quite
short and to the point, and it

135
00:08:47,439 --> 00:08:51,399
was generated out of that bot with
a little bit of extra tweaking.

136
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:56,599
Let's move on to A GPT agent designed
to generate your YouTube outro.

137
00:08:57,099 --> 00:09:01,779
Looking at the YouTube outro generator,
the main role is that it can create

138
00:09:01,779 --> 00:09:04,389
an engaging outro for your video.

139
00:09:04,719 --> 00:09:09,549
Now, the overview suggests that it's
about creating viewer engagement.

140
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,789
You want people to like and
subscribe, to do comments.

141
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:18,099
Maybe you want them to click on an end
card and go to one of your other videos.

142
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:23,249
Like the previous agent, the outro
creator has a configure command

143
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:27,419
where you can put the capability
that you wanna see within the outro.

144
00:09:27,719 --> 00:09:32,909
And the main ones that I like to use is a
call to action, maybe like and subscribe.

145
00:09:33,089 --> 00:09:38,609
I definitely like to do a recap of the
video and have some sort of video end card

146
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:40,859
that people can click on to go to related.

147
00:09:41,016 --> 00:09:44,186
Content and you can do that
all through the configuration.

148
00:09:44,366 --> 00:09:46,916
Before you worry about creating the outro.

149
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:52,726
It will come over to the GPTs and
we'll click on the tube outro writer

150
00:09:52,966 --> 00:09:56,866
craft engaging outros for YouTube
videos based on summaries and

151
00:09:56,866 --> 00:10:00,826
settings, and we can have a look at
what commands we'd got available.

152
00:10:01,326 --> 00:10:06,366
We can do a configuration, create an
outro, or look at the capabilities

153
00:10:06,456 --> 00:10:08,016
and we'll just run that one command.

154
00:10:08,016 --> 00:10:11,166
We're not going to give it any input,
we'll just see what it comes up with.

155
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:14,186
So we have a pretty extensive list.

156
00:10:14,216 --> 00:10:17,846
Call to actions, end cards,
and you could configure each

157
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:19,496
of these pieces of information.

158
00:10:19,501 --> 00:10:21,416
But we'll go for something quite simple.

159
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:24,026
We'll just go brevity and thanks.

160
00:10:24,476 --> 00:10:27,026
So I'll put in config with brevity.

161
00:10:27,236 --> 00:10:29,336
Thanks with like, and subscribe.

162
00:10:29,836 --> 00:10:32,986
I also added a configuration for AppyCast.

163
00:10:33,196 --> 00:10:37,756
At this point, we can just do a create
and do a paste, and what I've done is

164
00:10:37,756 --> 00:10:41,626
like, before, I've included the title of
the video and then the full transcript.

165
00:10:41,626 --> 00:10:45,326
In this case you can do it with
both transcripts and summaries.

166
00:10:45,476 --> 00:10:48,476
I find for this one, I like
to do the full transcript.

167
00:10:48,976 --> 00:10:52,246
So it's gone through and created
everything that we wanted.

168
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:57,636
I will read it in a moment, but what
I'd like it to do is just the script In

169
00:10:57,636 --> 00:11:02,316
this case, it's also given a few extra
instructions that could be useful for the

170
00:11:02,316 --> 00:11:04,596
video editor, but I just wanna read it.

171
00:11:05,096 --> 00:11:09,116
So what we got was that's wrap on
our scripting adventure with Shell

172
00:11:09,116 --> 00:11:12,566
Script helper so it understands
the context of the video.

173
00:11:12,926 --> 00:11:16,726
Big thanks for joining us on
this journey to simplify shell

174
00:11:16,796 --> 00:11:18,806
scripting with GPT Technology.

175
00:11:19,306 --> 00:11:22,846
If you loved diving into the Tech
with Us, show you support by hitting

176
00:11:22,846 --> 00:11:26,266
the like and subscribe to AppyCast.

177
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:30,046
So this is basically following
the guidelines that we did when

178
00:11:30,046 --> 00:11:31,846
we configured the capabilities.

179
00:11:32,346 --> 00:11:36,751
I just played the outro that was on
the video I created two days ago.

180
00:11:37,251 --> 00:11:40,971
Wouldn't it be great if the words
that you're saying in your transcript

181
00:11:41,071 --> 00:11:47,181
automagically turned into beautiful scenes
generated with, say, DALE3 or MidJourney?

182
00:11:47,181 --> 00:11:47,241
I.

183
00:11:47,741 --> 00:11:52,771
If you've ever used Nvidia AI or
maybe Pictory you've already seen

184
00:11:52,771 --> 00:11:57,871
this in action because what these
tools do is take the transcript and

185
00:11:57,871 --> 00:12:02,731
match it to images that it gets from
stock photography and stock video.

186
00:12:02,731 --> 00:12:06,751
Created this video about a week ago,
and if you look at the transcript,

187
00:12:06,841 --> 00:12:11,011
there's ideas like creating a
custom instruction in chat GPT.

188
00:12:11,341 --> 00:12:16,201
There's the ability to look at video
files that are put into a project folder,

189
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:20,731
and I'm talking about this and what I
want to do is make sure that the images.

190
00:12:20,761 --> 00:12:24,361
That come up as I'm talking,
match what I'm saying.

191
00:12:24,361 --> 00:12:27,301
So this is creating a
custom GPT instruction.

192
00:12:27,721 --> 00:12:32,011
Here I am programming a YouTube
video application and putting the

193
00:12:32,011 --> 00:12:34,771
recordings into a folder structure.

194
00:12:35,071 --> 00:12:38,521
So everything that you're seeing
here is generated directly

195
00:12:38,521 --> 00:12:40,996
out of Dali using A GPT agent.

196
00:12:41,496 --> 00:12:43,986
Let's have a look at the
individual images first.

197
00:12:44,286 --> 00:12:49,236
So the creating a custom chat
GPT instruction was created from

198
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:50,736
this particular prompt here.

199
00:12:50,976 --> 00:12:54,936
And as you go through, we've got
depict person demonstrating video file

200
00:12:54,936 --> 00:12:57,486
organization on a computer screen.

201
00:12:57,856 --> 00:13:02,476
visualize a user working with
eCamm Live Stream Deck and Hazel.

202
00:13:02,976 --> 00:13:07,146
the video that those images were
related to was about this software

203
00:13:07,146 --> 00:13:12,036
I'm creating called FliVideo, which
takes all my recordings and runs them

204
00:13:12,126 --> 00:13:17,046
through various GPTs to solve the
problems in a more automated fashion.

205
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:23,091
if we head over to GPT and look
at an agent that I've created

206
00:13:23,331 --> 00:13:26,191
for analyzing the transcription.

207
00:13:26,691 --> 00:13:31,281
You'll see that I've got a bot
here that looks at transcriptions

208
00:13:31,281 --> 00:13:32,721
in the form of scenes.

209
00:13:32,721 --> 00:13:37,671
So scene one, and it goes from three
seconds through to 50 seconds, and this is

210
00:13:37,671 --> 00:13:39,831
the words being said in the transcription.

211
00:13:40,071 --> 00:13:45,381
Then scene number two goes from 50 seconds
through to one minute and 34, and this

212
00:13:45,381 --> 00:13:48,411
is a regular file format for subtitles.

213
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,911
What I've been able to do
is take that information.

214
00:13:52,286 --> 00:13:56,456
Keep the numbers in place so the
numbers haven't changed, but instead

215
00:13:56,456 --> 00:14:00,026
prompts have been generated to
replace what was actually said.

216
00:14:00,216 --> 00:14:04,333
from these prompts, they can be
taken over to chat GPT, where

217
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:05,893
you can just create 'em manually.

218
00:14:05,893 --> 00:14:08,833
Now you may not want to create 'em
manually, and that's the reason why

219
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:12,643
I'm creating this software FliVideo,
and I'm just going through the various

220
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:17,203
episodes at the moment while I build it
out so that I can automate the B roll

221
00:14:17,203 --> 00:14:21,553
creation, whether it be images, which
is great with DALE3, or maybe you could

222
00:14:21,553 --> 00:14:24,943
use runway ML and generate B-roll video.

223
00:14:25,443 --> 00:14:29,303
The GPT agents that we've just
looked at, were all around content

224
00:14:29,303 --> 00:14:33,773
creation, whether it be the YouTube
intro, the outro, or B-roll.

225
00:14:34,103 --> 00:14:37,823
The next agent we're going to look
at is around the publishing of

226
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:40,973
your YouTube video, where you've
gotta fill in information like

227
00:14:41,003 --> 00:14:42,983
the description and the keywords.

228
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:47,323
Let's take a look at the description
from a video I did a week ago, and

229
00:14:47,323 --> 00:14:51,223
the video is called Build YouTube
Automation App with chat GPT.

230
00:14:51,723 --> 00:14:55,953
And the way it starts is join me
in the first episode of Build a

231
00:14:55,953 --> 00:14:58,533
YouTube automation app with chat GPT.

232
00:14:58,803 --> 00:15:03,093
So it's written an intro here in the
description that matches the title.

233
00:15:03,593 --> 00:15:05,693
From there, we have four sections.

234
00:15:05,693 --> 00:15:10,643
We've got what's inside episode
highlights, useful links including

235
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:14,543
affiliate links, and stay
tuned for more, and it finishes

236
00:15:14,543 --> 00:15:16,583
off with a bunch of keywords.

237
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:22,273
Let's take a look at the GPT agent for
YouTube description writing, and the role

238
00:15:22,273 --> 00:15:27,133
of this agent is to craft engaging and
informative YouTube video descriptions.

239
00:15:27,633 --> 00:15:32,343
The basic overview of this is that
it specializes in creating YouTube

240
00:15:32,433 --> 00:15:37,473
descriptions for videos, focusing on
SEO viewer engagement and compliance

241
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,003
within the YouTube guidelines.

242
00:15:39,503 --> 00:15:44,908
So with the additional guidelines around
hashtags, links, and discoverability,

243
00:15:45,058 --> 00:15:49,348
we should be able to start using
this GPT to create a new description.

244
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:55,248
the primary command for this particular
GPT is create, and usually I would

245
00:15:55,248 --> 00:15:57,378
provide it with a title and a summary.

246
00:15:57,558 --> 00:16:00,948
I might also have some special
instructions if I need it, and I

247
00:16:00,953 --> 00:16:06,258
often include extra metadata such
as affiliate links or branding

248
00:16:06,258 --> 00:16:08,358
links to my social media channels.

249
00:16:08,858 --> 00:16:13,308
Heading over to my GPTs, we've got
a video description wizard, which

250
00:16:13,308 --> 00:16:17,568
is a friendly yet professional
YouTube description expert, focusing

251
00:16:17,568 --> 00:16:20,148
on SEO engagement and compliance.

252
00:16:20,648 --> 00:16:23,588
Now what we'll do is we'll click
on the, I will give you a title,

253
00:16:23,588 --> 00:16:26,168
transcript and special instructions.

254
00:16:26,538 --> 00:16:28,218
at the moment it's just waiting for input.

255
00:16:28,768 --> 00:16:32,338
Select the analysis and the
summary as we scroll up.

256
00:16:32,338 --> 00:16:36,388
There's also the intro that was used
in this video and the title, and

257
00:16:36,388 --> 00:16:40,378
we'll take it a little bit further
and just copy the brand details and

258
00:16:40,383 --> 00:16:41,758
just put that into the clipboard.

259
00:16:42,258 --> 00:16:46,098
type in the word create with a colon,
and just paste everything that we've

260
00:16:46,098 --> 00:16:48,918
selected and see what it creates.

261
00:16:49,418 --> 00:16:53,798
It's got a title, which has
unlocked the power of GPTs, and

262
00:16:53,798 --> 00:16:55,568
then we move into the description.

263
00:16:55,568 --> 00:16:59,408
So I would be copying from
this little emoji all the way

264
00:16:59,413 --> 00:17:03,458
down what you'll discover, key
highlights, and stay connected

265
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:05,318
through some social media channels.

266
00:17:05,318 --> 00:17:09,118
There's a call to action to
like, share and subscribe, and

267
00:17:09,118 --> 00:17:11,128
following up with some keywords.

268
00:17:11,628 --> 00:17:16,578
Let's have a look at 3 GPT agents
to share our video on social media.

269
00:17:16,918 --> 00:17:21,028
we'll look at the tweet composer,
the LinkedIn video post writer,

270
00:17:21,268 --> 00:17:22,948
and the Facebook teaser.

271
00:17:23,448 --> 00:17:28,218
When I created the shell script
helper video, I tweeted it and

272
00:17:28,218 --> 00:17:32,688
it goes dive into the future of
scripting with shell script helper.

273
00:17:32,808 --> 00:17:37,758
Watch as I transform shell scripting
with ChatGPT and we've got a

274
00:17:37,758 --> 00:17:39,948
link and a couple of hashtags.

275
00:17:40,448 --> 00:17:45,518
Now looking at the Tweet composer,
GPT Agent, its role is to create

276
00:17:45,578 --> 00:17:47,378
tweets for YouTube videos.

277
00:17:47,498 --> 00:17:52,748
It emphasizes on capturing the
essence of videos in tweet format.

278
00:17:53,148 --> 00:17:56,834
when you use the create command,
which I've set up for this one, it

279
00:17:56,834 --> 00:18:02,114
expects a YouTube title, a link to the
video, and a couple of key highlights

280
00:18:02,264 --> 00:18:03,974
we could also pass in the summary.

281
00:18:04,024 --> 00:18:07,714
Let's head over to the tweet composer
and we'll see that it specializes

282
00:18:07,714 --> 00:18:11,914
in creating engaging tweets for
YouTube videos, and we'll click on

283
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,534
the commands to see what's available.

284
00:18:14,034 --> 00:18:17,514
The primary command is create,
which will create a tweet.

285
00:18:17,734 --> 00:18:20,314
paste in the information we
have from earlier, which is

286
00:18:20,314 --> 00:18:21,934
a little bit of metadata.

287
00:18:22,204 --> 00:18:25,684
We've got the title of the video,
and then we've got a summary.

288
00:18:25,684 --> 00:18:30,539
we could also use the analysis, which is
got more structure, and they would both

289
00:18:30,629 --> 00:18:33,119
produce different but useful tweets.

290
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:35,579
So let's just click on
that and see what we get.

291
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:37,069
Here's our tweet.

292
00:18:37,309 --> 00:18:39,979
Dive into the world of GPTs with AppyDave.

293
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:42,049
Discover how the shell script.

294
00:18:42,214 --> 00:18:48,214
Helper GPT transform shell scripting
from complex FFMPEG commands to

295
00:18:48,214 --> 00:18:50,134
chapter base video compiling.

296
00:18:50,474 --> 00:18:53,564
we've got a couple of hashtags in here
and we've got a link to the video.

297
00:18:53,724 --> 00:18:55,669
It may be a little bit
too long for the tweet.

298
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:59,149
It may still need a little bit of
refinement, but it does a pretty good

299
00:18:59,269 --> 00:19:02,179
job of creating a tweet for your video.

300
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:07,139
This GPT will work with your how to
video on YouTube and convert it into

301
00:19:07,139 --> 00:19:11,100
a LinkedIn post in a way that'll
extract the highlights and make it

302
00:19:11,104 --> 00:19:12,929
engaging for LinkedIn professionals.

303
00:19:13,429 --> 00:19:15,289
Diving into the GPT agent.

304
00:19:15,289 --> 00:19:20,619
Let's look at the a LinkedIn post that
was generated a week ago The video itself

305
00:19:20,624 --> 00:19:26,259
was build a YouTube automation app, and
I was doing the technical design for this

306
00:19:26,289 --> 00:19:31,689
tool that I'm creating that mixes in the
GPTs that we've been talking about with

307
00:19:31,689 --> 00:19:35,889
the transcriptions from the videos that
I record and just automates the process.

308
00:19:36,389 --> 00:19:40,139
But the interesting thing about the
LinkedIn posts that it generated.

309
00:19:40,349 --> 00:19:45,839
Was not only did it pull out the useful
information for YouTube content creators,

310
00:19:46,109 --> 00:19:50,699
but it also isolated that there's
an area in here about a programming

311
00:19:50,704 --> 00:19:53,189
language that I'm developing for GPT.

312
00:19:53,189 --> 00:19:58,859
So this is a GPT meta language, maybe an
advanced prompting language, and it's been

313
00:19:58,859 --> 00:20:01,469
able to pull that information out as well.

314
00:20:01,709 --> 00:20:03,659
So from a LinkedIn.

315
00:20:03,719 --> 00:20:05,519
Post generation point of view.

316
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:07,229
This was a one-shot post.

317
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:11,129
I put in the transcription, the summary
and everything, and it came out.

318
00:20:11,399 --> 00:20:15,689
We've got areas like the
hashtags, and then I just

319
00:20:15,694 --> 00:20:17,459
added the thumbnail at the end.

320
00:20:17,959 --> 00:20:23,810
Looking at the LinkedIn video post GPT,
we can see that its role is to transform

321
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:26,629
a video transcription to a LinkedIn post.

322
00:20:27,129 --> 00:20:31,480
The key guideline of this bot is to
extract key highlights from the video.

323
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:35,040
Include relevant call to
actions and insights that

324
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,110
adhere to LinkedIn standards.

325
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:42,590
Heading over to the GPT store, what
we can do is go to the tube LinkedIn

326
00:20:42,595 --> 00:20:46,940
transformer, and what this does is
specialize in transforming video

327
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:48,470
transcriptions into LinkedIn posts.

328
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:51,010
there's a couple of starter conversations.

329
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:53,950
I think the one we'll work with
is use special instructions

330
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,320
plus title and transcription.

331
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:01,350
Here we have the summary and the
structural analysis from the transcript.

332
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,270
we can use one or the other,
or we can even use both.

333
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:08,200
They essentially say the same thing
they just said in different ways.

334
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:11,870
if I copy all this information,
I've also included the YouTube

335
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:13,820
title and a little bit of metadata.

336
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:18,320
it's just finishing off the article
at the moment, but if we move up,

337
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:23,950
we've got unleashing the potential
of gpt in Shell scripting a case

338
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:26,110
study with shell script helper.

339
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:30,190
Then we've got a couple of hashtags
and some sort of introduction and

340
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:31,540
we can go and watch the video.

341
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,640
Let's actually see if that works.

342
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:35,330
Looks like it's loading up.

343
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:41,140
That's great, and it just goes on to
talk about this video based on the way we

344
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:46,750
use either the summary or the transcript
analysis or even the transcript itself,

345
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:52,120
you'll get different outputs, but
usually this is a one-shot prompt for me.

346
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:56,290
I put the information in, I get it
out, and tiny little bit of tweaking.

347
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:57,160
It's ready to go.

348
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:02,340
This next GPT agent is to
create a teaser on your Facebook

349
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,440
profile for your YouTube video.

350
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:09,320
Let's have a look at an example Facebook
teaser that I've done for the last

351
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,690
video, which was the Shell Script helper.

352
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:16,610
And some of the things that you notice
is there's no YouTube title as such.

353
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:20,930
There's just a statement unleashing
the power of AI in Shell scripting,

354
00:22:20,935 --> 00:22:26,540
which is more Facebook like, and
it's made really good use of emojis.

355
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:29,870
It's got a couple of hashtags going
on and then a link to the video.

356
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,820
Now, this is in contrast.

357
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:37,840
the two videos I did just before
episode one and episode two in Building

358
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,470
FliVideo where I've just manually
written this sort of stuff, it's okay,

359
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:47,500
but it's a lot better when we use
concepts like emojis and hashtags to

360
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,990
make this searchable and more engaging.

361
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:55,260
I hope you found the insights from the
seven YouTube automation bots useful.

362
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:00,590
We dived into how each GPT from an
intro writer to the Facebook teaser

363
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:02,630
is simplifying content creation.

364
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:06,640
Remember, it's all about making
the process more efficient and

365
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,200
your content more engaging.

366
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:12,690
