1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,610
Have you ever traveled from a Western
country to somewhere like Thailand, and

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:10,130
when you did a Google search, you saw
this thing called BE or Buddhist time.

3
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:14,830
In this video, I'm going to show you
how to deal with the Buddhist era

4
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:17,230
number showing up in your Google search.

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:22,290
Today I'm AppyDave, and last week I
moved to Thailand from Australia and I'm

6
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:24,270
here to do a little bit of videography.

7
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:28,120
when I got here I did a search
in the local area, which is

8
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,980
Chang Mai for things to do.

9
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,730
one of the things I noticed was that
a lot of the references had a date and

10
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:36,920
time in it that I didn't understand.

11
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:44,660
So here we've got August 6, 2566
BE or the one below it, 2567 BE.

12
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:49,260
last week when I did the same sort
of search, everything was showing

13
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:56,880
up in my local date format, so 19th
of February, 2024, or January, 2024.

14
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,520
So I wondered what's going on here.

15
00:00:59,520 --> 00:00:59,550
I.

16
00:01:00,049 --> 00:01:03,379
In the Western world, we
use the Gregorian calendar.

17
00:01:03,409 --> 00:01:07,309
When we show dates in Australia,
it might start off with the day

18
00:01:07,309 --> 00:01:10,609
followed by the month in America,
the month followed by the day.

19
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:14,839
But when you go to somewhere
like Thailand, they use Buddhist

20
00:01:14,845 --> 00:01:16,669
era or the Buddhist calendar.

21
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:21,430
Now going to other countries, you might
have other sorts of calendars working

22
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:25,330
out, and hopefully this video will show
you how to solve that problem as well.

23
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:29,255
let's have a look at how we can
fix this particular problem.

24
00:01:29,554 --> 00:01:33,664
Now, the first thing I tried when I
arrived in Chiang Mai this week was

25
00:01:33,664 --> 00:01:39,125
I headed over to my settings within
my Mac computer and I played around

26
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:40,565
with the date and time settings.

27
00:01:40,565 --> 00:01:47,074
I set the time zone to Indo China time,
Bangkok, Thailand as the nearest location.

28
00:01:47,554 --> 00:01:51,245
Then I headed over to the
region settings, and from here

29
00:01:51,245 --> 00:01:53,134
I left the region as Thailand.

30
00:01:53,285 --> 00:01:57,095
But I set the calendar to
Gregorian and the date format to

31
00:01:57,095 --> 00:01:58,955
what I'm used to in Australia.

32
00:01:59,454 --> 00:02:04,014
With my settings in place, I headed over
to Google search and typed in what to do

33
00:02:04,014 --> 00:02:06,854
near me, and there was a bit of an issue.

34
00:02:06,884 --> 00:02:13,160
What I noticed was that the
date was set to 2566, BE.

35
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:17,110
So changing the settings didn't
solve this particular problem.

36
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:21,250
So a little bit of a Google search
led me to this article here.

37
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,330
The dates on Google search
results are in Buddhist era, and

38
00:02:25,335 --> 00:02:26,860
someone had an answer to that.

39
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:31,360
The answer was, you need to change these
settings within Google preferences.

40
00:02:31,859 --> 00:02:34,109
So let's head over to the preferences.

41
00:02:34,109 --> 00:02:39,359
We go to google.com/preferences
and you'll see a screen like this.

42
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:43,649
Now click on the first menu item
under it called Other settings,

43
00:02:44,149 --> 00:02:47,269
and you'll notice an option
there called Language and Region.

44
00:02:47,299 --> 00:02:50,809
Now, if you click on that, you'll
come to this area where there's

45
00:02:50,839 --> 00:02:54,919
the Results Region, and it's
currently set to current region.

46
00:02:55,309 --> 00:02:59,179
Current region in this
particular situation is Thailand.

47
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:03,129
So what you can do is click on
the Results Region and change it.

48
00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:08,339
So I've typed in Australia and I've
selected Australia, and now the setting

49
00:03:08,369 --> 00:03:10,949
is changed within Google preferences.

50
00:03:11,449 --> 00:03:15,589
Now let's head over to Google search
and we'll type in what to do near me.

51
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:20,269
And the first thing you'll notice is that
the dates are now showing the way I like.

52
00:03:20,274 --> 00:03:23,629
We've got the 25th of January, 2024.

53
00:03:24,129 --> 00:03:27,429
If you look closely, you
might notice there's a pretty

54
00:03:27,429 --> 00:03:29,079
big problem going on here.

55
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:34,079
When I did the search, everything that
was paid search was in the region that

56
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:36,299
I'm in at the moment, which is Chiang Mai.

57
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:40,529
But the organic search was
all showing up from Australia.

58
00:03:41,029 --> 00:03:45,679
And the reason for that is because we've
set the results region to Australia.

59
00:03:46,179 --> 00:03:51,159
Unfortunately, the solution that I'm
showing you can be one way or the other.

60
00:03:51,339 --> 00:03:54,549
There may be a better way, but
this is how I've figured it out.

61
00:03:54,969 --> 00:03:59,349
For me, I prefer to have Western time
show up against documents because

62
00:03:59,349 --> 00:04:04,389
usually I'm searching for information
where time relevance is important.

63
00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:08,939
If, on the other hand, you really
need region specific searches

64
00:04:08,969 --> 00:04:12,299
all the time, you might not want
to put this setting in place.

65
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,019
Let's say you want the
best of both worlds.

66
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:17,029
You can get it in a subtle way.

67
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:20,659
You can have it set to Western
time like I have now, and just

68
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:22,399
alter the way you do your search.

69
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:26,809
So in this case, I've said what to
do in Chiang Mai, and this way I'm

70
00:04:26,809 --> 00:04:31,579
getting both the western dates where
the articles were written and they

71
00:04:31,579 --> 00:04:33,799
are pointing to the location I need.

72
00:04:34,299 --> 00:04:35,019
I'm AppyDave.

73
00:04:35,049 --> 00:04:37,869
I hope to be creating videos
here in Chiang Mai for the

74
00:04:37,869 --> 00:04:39,459
next three to six months.

75
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:44,109
But if you are interested in what I
do, I either do videos on artificial

76
00:04:44,109 --> 00:04:46,299
intelligence or prompt engineering.
