RAW SCRIPT

0:01 Have you ever used Google search and when you do a search, you see these dates for articles that don't make sense to you?
0:09 Like this example here, 6th of August, 2566BE, or February 19, 2567BE. I've just come to another country from Australia and last week I was seeing dates for articles that made sense to me, like the 25th of July 2023 or December 2022.
0:38 And I've seen this problem before because I live between two countries. Sometimes I'm in Sydney or Brisbane in Australia, other times I'm in Chiang Mai in Thailand.
0:48 And the last time it happened, it took me a little while to figure out what was going on and I thought I'd do a prop- do a video to show you how to solve this problem.
0:58 Let's talk about what the problem is. So if you're in America or Europe or Australia. Then you're probably using something called a Gregorian calendar to show dates and times on your computer.
1:12 Now you might have different formats. In Australia we use DD-MM-YY. In America they use MM-DD-YY. And this is all part of the Gregorian calendar.
1:24 But in Thailand they use something called the Buddhist calendar or Buddhist era. And you'll see it if you see the letters B-E.
1:32 Now it's not the only calendar out there. According to ChatGPT we have Islamic, Hebrew, Chinese. The one here called the Julian was a precursor to the Gregorian.
1:43 And so you might see other sorts of characters on your Google search. And if you're thinking, let's go and change the settings within the community.
1:52 it may not solve the problem as expected. Now I'm on a Mac, so let's head over to settings. And firstly I'm going to type in region and have a look at what I've got here.
2:04 So currently I've got the region set to Thailand. Which I believe would be the correct way to go, I'm not sure.
2:11 But I do know that it's set to that and I've got Gregorian calendar set up. And one of the things that you can do on the Mac is you can go and change it.
2:21 So I could have it on the Buddhist era. I can also change the date time format or the date format as I see fit.
2:30 So I've set it to 19th of August 2024. That seems correct for me. Now I'll just change one other setting, we'll just head over to the date.
2:44 And I've just got it set automatically based off a particular source, in this case it's Apple. And you can see here that the date and time is showing up in Buddhist era format and then time zone is set to Bangkok, Thailand.
2:59 I'm in Chiang Mai, so that's about right. And when I look up at the date and time on my computer, it says the 6th of May at 1.53 in the afternoon, which is the correct date.
3:12 That's correct time for me here in Thailand right now. But if I head over to Google and I do a search, and I'm just going to go with what's near me, and press enter.
3:25 And I've got a bunch of articles and, and links to other sorts of sites, and when they're an article, it gives me when the article was created.
3:35 So we've got the best, 20 best things to do in Chiang Mai, voyage tips, but it's set to August 2, 5, 6, 6, B.E.
3:43 And I'm thinking, well, was this done a year ago, or was it done 10 years ago, and this is the problem I'm trying to solve.
3:50 And no, no amount of changing of settings on the computer is actually going to solve this problem. And the reason for that, is that this is a Google setting.
4:00 So, if we go over to google.com slash preferences, you end up with a page like this. We've got our search settings, and one of the menu items in here is called other settings.
4:14 From the other settings, you can then get started. Go to this area called language and region. So we'll click on that, and from here, you have the ability to change how region results are shown.
4:27 And currently it's set to the current region, which is Thailand. end. So we're going to change this, but I'm also going to talk about the problem with doing it this particular way.
4:38 But let's give it a whirl. So currently we're on current region, and if we type in Australia, which I know will have documents in the date format that I want, and press enter.
4:48 Let's confirm. I can head back to Google, do the same search term, what to do near me, and what'll happen is that you will start getting documents formatted the way you want.
5:02 So here we have the 19th of February. January 2024, and the 4th of January 2024. So on first, on first look, it looks like we have a great answer.
5:16 We've now got the dates and times the way we want. But there is. Because in changing the region the way we did within Google search, it also changes where it thinks you're searching.
5:29 And because I used the term what's near me, it's not looking for results from Google. It's actually doing it in Australia, which doesn't make any sense for me the way I'm using it.
5:42 So, this is a little bit of a kludge. I don't know why they don't have an ability to format dates and times correctly in your local region.
5:52 I don't know. I don't understand why you have to change it to a different region of the world to do search to solve this problem.
5:58 But I do know that I can at least do a little bit different search term and I can say in Chiang Mai instead.
6:08 In. Chiang. And what'll happen is I will get documents with the right sort of date showing up next to the document and in this particular case, I'm getting them shown in Chiang Mai anyway.
6:25 The solution doesn't solve all the problems of change of displaying dates in a Gregorian calendar from Google search. You can see the challenge that's going on there, but hopefully it works for most people.
6:38 It's the way I'm going to work because I know I'm It never makes any sense to me when I see the Buddhist era timestamps.
6:46 I just now know that I have to be a bit specific if there's a region type search going on. I'm Appy Dave.
6:53 I usually work on ChatGPT and PromptEngine. But, I happen to be in Thailand at the moment and I thought this video might be useful to people.
