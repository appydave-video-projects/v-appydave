1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:05,710
You had trouble researching complex
topics with ChatGPT because you

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,710
can't feed it enough information.

3
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:13,780
In this video, I use custom prompt
instructions to allow research on a

4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:21,280
variety of documents while maintaining
short-term memory within the ChatGPT bot.

5
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:25,270
A couple of weeks ago, a product
called Open Interpreter started

6
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:30,670
gaining popularity and I realized I
needed to figure out what was going

7
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,120
on with this particular project,
do a little bit of research.

8
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,600
I also wanted to create a video, and I
noticed that there were a lot of people

9
00:00:38,779 --> 00:00:43,460
starting to talk about this product,
and I wanted to listen to the video.

10
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:49,750
But also put the transcripts through
ChatGPT and a combination of those

11
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:54,490
transcripts and the documentation
from the project itself was something

12
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:56,589
that I need to do research on.

13
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:00,970
There are a few different ways
to research complex documents in

14
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:05,530
ChatGPT, but the one I'm going to work
with today is custom instructions.

15
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:10,419
And at the moment I've just started
with this simple little idea to

16
00:01:10,419 --> 00:01:12,100
outline what I'd like to achieve.

17
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:18,530
What we'll do is start with a
GPT 4 blank slate, and we go down

18
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:20,959
to our settings where we can.

19
00:01:21,095 --> 00:01:25,745
And put in custom instructions and
I'll just paste the outline that I did.

20
00:01:25,995 --> 00:01:28,215
this is not exactly what I wanna say.

21
00:01:28,215 --> 00:01:32,925
In fact, I don't know the exact prompt at
the beginning of this session because I'm

22
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:38,395
going to work through it as I develop and
do my research on the particular video.

23
00:01:38,945 --> 00:01:39,755
the main things.

24
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:45,020
I know I need this custom instruction
to do each time is it needs to

25
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:48,920
understand the topic that we are
working with and maintain it.

26
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:55,120
it needs to comprehend new information
coming in and feed it into a simple

27
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:00,665
information structure that it has a
long-term memory as I do my research.

28
00:02:01,585 --> 00:02:06,385
I don't want it to waste energy trying to
tell me information I don't care about.

29
00:02:06,415 --> 00:02:08,095
I'll ask the questions.

30
00:02:08,275 --> 00:02:12,371
It should just give me simple
replies I will need it to

31
00:02:12,371 --> 00:02:14,431
work with specific commands.

32
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:17,161
I believe I'll need to add documents.

33
00:02:17,321 --> 00:02:22,311
I might need to break documents appart
and feed 'em in because they're too big.

34
00:02:22,671 --> 00:02:27,351
Sometimes I'll want to get information
of the current state of the second

35
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:32,001
brain, the second brain being the
information that it's maintaining for me.

36
00:02:32,225 --> 00:02:35,975
I'll move forward and start
writing a custom instruction

37
00:02:36,005 --> 00:02:36,845
and we'll see how it works.

38
00:02:37,845 --> 00:02:43,365
When we look at this first statement, I
realized that the starting point is to let

39
00:02:43,365 --> 00:02:45,885
it know that it's my research assistant.

40
00:02:46,885 --> 00:02:51,180
When we look at you'll need to be
reading and comprehending my documents.

41
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:56,100
I think the prompt we can put in
here would be something like you will

42
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:00,720
maintain a document outline and summarize
the information you have collected.

43
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:05,810
the next step would be to do a
document title, but I really want

44
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,840
to get into commands right now
while they're still in my head.

45
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:14,890
The thing about maintaining a summary
of information is that ChatGPT doesn't

46
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:19,713
always maintain the right information,
and I believe I'm going to need some

47
00:03:19,713 --> 00:03:24,663
commands that I can use to tell it
what's really important, what's just

48
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:26,763
generally important and what is not.

49
00:03:27,883 --> 00:03:31,543
Of use to me right now,
basically a command to ignore

50
00:03:31,543 --> 00:03:33,373
certain pieces of information.

51
00:03:33,853 --> 00:03:37,303
So let's go and think about
the commands we might need.

52
00:03:38,303 --> 00:03:41,543
The first command I've added
here is just called add.

53
00:03:41,543 --> 00:03:48,863
I guess I would like to type ADD: and
then just paste in a transcript and have

54
00:03:48,863 --> 00:03:51,113
that transcript added into the document.

55
00:03:52,113 --> 00:03:56,283
First command we would need would be
to add information to the document

56
00:03:57,093 --> 00:04:02,823
I've put in this ad followed by ad
provided information to the document.

57
00:04:03,823 --> 00:04:08,083
Now, I suspect that when I add
information to the document it might

58
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:12,613
get things a little bit wrong, and I
think what we could try is a command

59
00:04:12,613 --> 00:04:17,203
called drop, and that will be, if I
give it some extra information, it

60
00:04:17,203 --> 00:04:19,483
just drops that from the main document.

61
00:04:20,483 --> 00:04:26,093
As the document develops, I'm sure there's
going to be like a list or an outline.

62
00:04:26,093 --> 00:04:32,063
So we will add a new command called
T O C for table of Contents, and

63
00:04:32,068 --> 00:04:36,023
essentially I just want to get
the table of contents based on

64
00:04:36,023 --> 00:04:37,493
the document that it's maintained.

65
00:04:38,493 --> 00:04:42,410
This table of contents will help me
understand things, but there'll be

66
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:44,630
times when I need the detail as well.

67
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,950
We'll add a command called detail
that just shows the entire document.

68
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:54,539
I suspect that from time to time
I'm going to want it to just give

69
00:04:54,539 --> 00:04:57,479
me its opinion on certain concepts.

70
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,169
When it does that, I don't want the
information added to the document.

71
00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:03,869
I do wanna be able to
evaluate that information.

72
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:09,059
I also don't want it to write an essay,
so I'm believing something like 50

73
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:13,739
words might be good, and from time to
time I need to change that as well.

74
00:05:13,929 --> 00:05:19,569
we'll create a command called Q 50 What
it will do is I give it a question.

75
00:05:19,599 --> 00:05:21,939
It'll gimme a 50 word answer.

76
00:05:21,969 --> 00:05:25,749
It won't add it to the document,
and I'll also let it know that

77
00:05:25,869 --> 00:05:27,539
it, can accept other numbers?

78
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:31,950
I might do Q 30 for 30 words
or Q 100 for a hundred words.

79
00:05:32,429 --> 00:05:35,039
We need to maintain a title we
haven't dealt with that yet.

80
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,369
Maintain and update the
document on research.

81
00:05:38,609 --> 00:05:40,140
We've got that covered.

82
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,239
Provide simple replies.

83
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:46,530
I'm gonna have to write a prompt for that
soon and respond to specific commands.

84
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,479
We've got most of them in place.

85
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:51,599
I'll just add one other
we'll put in the title.

86
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:57,760
Or command this, I would start the
research with, so we have a title.

87
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,790
One of the things that I think will
happen as I research information

88
00:06:00,795 --> 00:06:05,530
is I might want to update the title
based on new information coming in.

89
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:11,419
this command should be able to create
or update a title on the fly means

90
00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:15,739
we can finally just delete these
pieces of information and let's

91
00:06:15,739 --> 00:06:16,939
figure out how we'll write this.

92
00:06:17,059 --> 00:06:22,409
Prompt deal with how GPT
responds to each of our commands.

93
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:26,759
There is a section called How would you
like GPT to Respond, which we can fill in.

94
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:31,259
Essentially, I want to take the
ADD and the DROP command and

95
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:32,729
make sure it just says, 'YAY'.

96
00:06:32,729 --> 00:06:37,109
I do not need any other information
other than an acknowledgement.

97
00:06:37,469 --> 00:06:40,559
That it's added or removed
it from the document.

98
00:06:41,219 --> 00:06:45,089
When it comes to the table of contents or
the details, it's going to have to give

99
00:06:45,089 --> 00:06:50,159
me the information I want, but I don't
want any other additional information.

100
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:54,484
lastly, with the question, it can
write whatever it likes so long

101
00:06:54,484 --> 00:06:56,794
as it's 50 words or 30 words.

102
00:06:57,844 --> 00:07:00,634
prompt that I'm going to
put in here looks like this.

103
00:07:01,114 --> 00:07:05,734
Do not give any additional information
for simple commands like add and drop.

104
00:07:05,734 --> 00:07:09,814
Say Yay for table of contents,
write that for details.

105
00:07:09,814 --> 00:07:14,284
Write that and for question, you
will gimme an A answer to the

106
00:07:14,289 --> 00:07:16,624
question in that number of words.

107
00:07:16,954 --> 00:07:21,574
I do know that ChatGPT will
sometimes still give other.

108
00:07:21,964 --> 00:07:26,974
Common phrases around the document
and I may need to come in here and

109
00:07:26,974 --> 00:07:31,259
tell it not to do that, but for now,
this is where we're going to start, I

110
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:36,539
wanna find out whether it understands
what its role is, what is your role,

111
00:07:37,109 --> 00:07:39,809
press enter, see what it comes up with.

112
00:07:40,529 --> 00:07:46,149
My role is to be your research assistant,
I will maintain a document outline and a

113
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:48,189
summary of information I have collected.

114
00:07:48,579 --> 00:07:53,719
I will respond to specific commands
such as ADD DROP, TOC DETAIL, Q50

115
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:56,319
and TITLE as per your instructions.

116
00:07:56,799 --> 00:07:58,449
This is looking good so far.

117
00:07:58,839 --> 00:07:59,949
Let's put in a title.

118
00:07:59,949 --> 00:08:06,709
We'll head on over to the website,
copy the term open interpreter,

119
00:08:06,709 --> 00:08:09,239
and just paste it in, says she.

120
00:08:09,724 --> 00:08:10,324
Perfect.

121
00:08:11,114 --> 00:08:15,314
the documentation around this tool
is that it's a code interpreter

122
00:08:15,314 --> 00:08:17,564
to run locally on your computer.

123
00:08:18,044 --> 00:08:21,404
There's a whole lot of
information in a Read me file.

124
00:08:21,854 --> 00:08:25,934
If I open up that read Me
file in raw format, there'll

125
00:08:25,934 --> 00:08:27,344
be a bunch of information.

126
00:08:27,344 --> 00:08:28,814
It would be nice to strip out the.

127
00:08:28,989 --> 00:08:29,710
H T M L.

128
00:08:29,769 --> 00:08:35,020
But essentially I should just be able
to take a bunch of this raw information,

129
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:40,329
but not too much because ChatGPT can only
take a certain amount of information.

130
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,510
Head over to ChatGPT.

131
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:48,299
We'll give our ADD command and we'll
just paste this information in we've got

132
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:50,699
a response of 'YAY', which is perfect.

133
00:08:50,969 --> 00:08:54,169
I think it might be time
for a table of contents.

134
00:08:54,669 --> 00:08:57,009
we have a partial information.

135
00:08:57,429 --> 00:09:01,869
I haven't read through the documentation,
but this seems to be about right.

136
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:07,809
Let's head back to the read me file and
we'll grab another chunk of information.

137
00:09:08,059 --> 00:09:08,589
not too much.

138
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:14,219
We'll get to about here,
I think back to G P T.

139
00:09:14,219 --> 00:09:17,929
We'll put in, add and paste that new

140
00:09:17,929 --> 00:09:24,458
information  type TOC there's definitely
more information coming through.

141
00:09:25,088 --> 00:09:28,538
Just adding a final little bit of
information that I missed at the

142
00:09:28,543 --> 00:09:31,748
bottom, just a little bit of coding.

143
00:09:31,763 --> 00:09:32,483
Information.

144
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:37,103
At this point, I'd like to see what
detail I can get out of the document.

145
00:09:37,103 --> 00:09:40,853
I don't know that I'd get all the
information from the Readme file

146
00:09:40,853 --> 00:09:45,353
because there's too much information
in the form of tokens, but since

147
00:09:45,353 --> 00:09:49,803
this has been summarizing and keeping
detailed information, we'll just

148
00:09:49,803 --> 00:09:54,363
type in detail, see what we get, and
it's starting to write out a couple

149
00:09:54,363 --> 00:09:58,773
of commands that's going to show us
how to use it, access to the demo.

150
00:09:58,773 --> 00:09:59,553
We've got a.

151
00:09:59,658 --> 00:10:02,838
Quick start, guide, and commands.

152
00:10:03,498 --> 00:10:08,748
This is all looking pretty good and I
could probably use it just as it is as

153
00:10:08,748 --> 00:10:14,238
a question and answer bot to install
and start using this particular project.

154
00:10:14,538 --> 00:10:19,968
But in the next step, what I'd like to do
is watch a couple of the videos by some

155
00:10:19,968 --> 00:10:23,988
of the other people on YouTube and see
how they're working with open interpreter.

156
00:10:24,988 --> 00:10:28,858
My research bot is currently loaded
up with the documentation from code

157
00:10:28,858 --> 00:10:33,148
interpreter, but what I'd like to
do now is take some videos from

158
00:10:33,148 --> 00:10:38,458
YouTube, grab their transcriptions and
load them into my research as well.

159
00:10:38,588 --> 00:10:42,908
the way I've done that is I've used
the ADD command that we already

160
00:10:42,913 --> 00:10:48,248
had access to, and I've added
these transcription summaries we.

161
00:10:48,308 --> 00:10:52,148
Have one here, another one
here, and they just keep going.

162
00:10:52,148 --> 00:10:56,858
I keep adding transcription summaries into
the research, but you might be wondering

163
00:10:57,068 --> 00:10:59,888
how did I get a transcription summary?

164
00:11:00,188 --> 00:11:05,648
And the way I did that was by running
YouTube transcriptions through my

165
00:11:05,648 --> 00:11:10,428
transcription summarizer Bot to
do the transcription summaries.

166
00:11:10,428 --> 00:11:14,658
I actually had to have videos in
which to transcribe, so right here I

167
00:11:14,658 --> 00:11:19,578
have a video called Open Interpreter,
open Source version of ChatGPT.

168
00:11:19,878 --> 00:11:24,528
It's a 13 minute video, and if I move
through the different videos that I

169
00:11:24,528 --> 00:11:29,108
researched, I had all these different
people in the last two weeks who have

170
00:11:29,108 --> 00:11:34,648
been doing detailed videos on open
interpreter, you can grab a transcript

171
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:39,598
and copy it into a text file, and
I did it for each individual video

172
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:44,799
that I came across so that I could
use it within the YouTube transcript.

173
00:11:45,164 --> 00:11:45,464
Bot.

174
00:11:45,964 --> 00:11:51,454
from the point of view of the research bot
in which I've added all these different

175
00:11:51,454 --> 00:11:57,904
summarizations, we then need to move over
to one of the YouTube transcription bots.

176
00:11:58,144 --> 00:12:00,214
Here's one on open interpreter.

177
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:03,849
We've got a summary
here and at the bottom.

178
00:12:04,029 --> 00:12:10,019
I can copy it move it to the original
bot, I just repeat that for each of the

179
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:12,239
YouTube transcriptions that I want to do.

180
00:12:12,244 --> 00:12:17,154
I grab the information I want, but you
might be wondering where is the YouTube?

181
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:18,369
Transcription bot.

182
00:12:18,869 --> 00:12:23,309
let's head over to a new ChatGPT
window, and I'm just gonna paste in this

183
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:28,229
little prompt here called What role and
instructions have I assigned to you?

184
00:12:28,719 --> 00:12:31,869
this is a YouTube transcription bot.

185
00:12:31,869 --> 00:12:33,069
I've preloaded it.

186
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:36,989
You have assigned me the role of
YouTube transcription assistant.

187
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:41,099
I can read through transcriptions and
build a detailed document, which is the

188
00:12:41,099 --> 00:12:46,379
goal that I needed for the research,
but it's got similar sorts of commands,

189
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:49,539
like ADD, DROP, STORIES I can ask.

190
00:12:49,739 --> 00:12:50,819
Questions.

191
00:12:51,819 --> 00:12:54,999
It hasn't listed a particular
command called titles.

192
00:12:54,999 --> 00:12:59,139
I can generate a bunch of YouTube
titles based off the transcript,

193
00:12:59,719 --> 00:13:04,459
this is basically how I make bots
work with one another just using

194
00:13:04,464 --> 00:13:06,229
various custom instructions.

195
00:13:06,229 --> 00:13:11,504
if you want to understand how I built this
particular custom instruction, I'll put a.

196
00:13:11,534 --> 00:13:12,764
Link in the description.

197
00:13:13,764 --> 00:13:18,294
Now we're back at our original research
bot, and I'm just gonna put in a quick

198
00:13:18,354 --> 00:13:21,174
prompt, what is your role and command?

199
00:13:21,174 --> 00:13:23,664
I just want us remember what
I've got available here.

200
00:13:24,414 --> 00:13:26,394
It's to be a research assistant.

201
00:13:26,424 --> 00:13:30,234
We can add, drop, and
get table of contents.

202
00:13:30,874 --> 00:13:35,644
we should do a detail and see what all
the different information that we've

203
00:13:35,644 --> 00:13:41,559
added to the bot has done for us from
this detailed command, we've got a fairly.

204
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:46,059
Extensive master document
that's been created.

205
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:49,869
We've got this limitations
for big data, git repository,

206
00:13:49,869 --> 00:13:51,969
cloning, community engagement.

207
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:54,959
If we move through, there's
additional documents that are

208
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,559
being summarized and added into.

209
00:13:56,764 --> 00:14:01,044
Of the main document open
interpreter, YouTube video analysis.

210
00:14:01,044 --> 00:14:02,544
We've got information here.

211
00:14:02,814 --> 00:14:06,024
If we keep going down,
we've got another one.

212
00:14:06,834 --> 00:14:12,564
One of the things that I notice is a
lot of the commands from the original

213
00:14:12,569 --> 00:14:16,794
instruction guide from GitHub are
missing, but we may still be able

214
00:14:16,794 --> 00:14:20,694
to get them out, let's see if we can
get the setup instructions for open

215
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:23,144
interpreter, and I could do a Q 50.

216
00:14:23,594 --> 00:14:27,554
I might even just be able to get
away with a regular prompt, but

217
00:14:27,584 --> 00:14:29,384
I'm going to try this one first.

218
00:14:29,384 --> 00:14:31,034
It was one of the commands I set up.

219
00:14:31,274 --> 00:14:34,364
Can you give me a setup
guide to create my own?

220
00:14:34,904 --> 00:14:35,894
Open interpreter.

221
00:14:36,394 --> 00:14:40,054
the great thing about that is it's
just given me the 50 word summary.

222
00:14:40,174 --> 00:14:43,444
Let's do the same prompt
again without the command.

223
00:14:43,944 --> 00:14:48,654
this looks like it's given us a
more detailed list of instructions

224
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:50,154
that we can run from the terminal.

225
00:14:50,154 --> 00:14:51,624
To set up open interpreter.

226
00:14:52,624 --> 00:14:56,784
I don't tend to do too many more
commands from the research, bot

227
00:14:56,974 --> 00:15:00,724
generally once I've done my research,
I'll take that information over

228
00:15:00,724 --> 00:15:04,774
to other bots, but it doesn't stop
us from doing standard prompts.

229
00:15:05,014 --> 00:15:10,144
What we'll try here is can you
create an engaging YouTube script

230
00:15:10,504 --> 00:15:12,154
based on the detailed document.

231
00:15:12,314 --> 00:15:16,844
, normally I would take that to the YouTube
script and title bot, but let's say.

232
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:18,419
What it comes up with.

233
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,599
here we have a YouTube script.

234
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:22,159
Let's look at this intro.

235
00:15:22,189 --> 00:15:24,229
B roll with upbeat music.

236
00:15:24,229 --> 00:15:25,159
Sounds about right.

237
00:15:25,429 --> 00:15:26,209
Hello everyone.

238
00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:29,689
Welcome back to the channel if you
are passionate about AI coding and

239
00:15:29,689 --> 00:15:33,889
game changing technology, and smash
the light button and hit subscribe.

240
00:15:34,189 --> 00:15:38,529
Today we're diving deep into something
that's been buzzing on social media.

241
00:15:39,024 --> 00:15:42,984
Open interpreter, Gary Marcus
himself tweeted about it.

242
00:15:43,134 --> 00:15:44,484
So you know, it's a big deal.

243
00:15:44,584 --> 00:15:49,234
I know that statement did actually come
out of one of the transcriptions that I.

244
00:15:49,414 --> 00:15:49,984
Watched.

245
00:15:50,434 --> 00:15:52,324
is this the way I would write a script?

246
00:15:52,354 --> 00:15:52,894
No.

247
00:15:52,894 --> 00:15:59,434
And that's why I would have a YouTube
script writing set of prompts designed

248
00:15:59,434 --> 00:16:03,424
and feed the information into them
instead so that I can get the style.

249
00:16:03,664 --> 00:16:07,804
But the good thing is this is a pretty
good script, just of its own accord.

250
00:16:08,764 --> 00:16:12,364
This has been a deep dive into
the researcher bot a custom

251
00:16:12,364 --> 00:16:16,234
instruction prompt that you can
use for research and development.

252
00:16:16,504 --> 00:16:17,554
It's also part.

253
00:16:17,614 --> 00:16:22,114
Of a set of advanced prompts that I've
been developing, and they're part of

254
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:24,274
a podcast that I'm putting together.

255
00:16:24,514 --> 00:16:26,884
You should be able to find information in.
