1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,279
An hour ago, this awesome
feature got added to chat GPT.

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:05,479
Now I hadn't seen it.

3
00:00:05,479 --> 00:00:07,909
I hadn't heard about it, but here it is.

4
00:00:07,909 --> 00:00:09,470
It's called the at mention.

5
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:13,220
And what it's done is allowed me to
create the video you're watching right

6
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:18,830
now in about one hour using four or
five GPTs, all working in orchestration.

7
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:20,090
It's just magical.

8
00:00:20,589 --> 00:00:24,610
So we're in a brand new chat GPT
window, and if I type in the at symbol,

9
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:30,220
we'll have access to a bunch of GPTs
that you've either used or created.

10
00:00:30,459 --> 00:00:35,050
Many of these I've created, so if we
look at F YouTube teaser, this turns a

11
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:38,320
YouTube video into a Facebook teaser post.

12
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:40,300
Got the same thing for tweets.

13
00:00:40,419 --> 00:00:44,199
I can make YouTube intros,
and recently I did seven.

14
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,150
GPT is specifically for
YouTube content creators.

15
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:51,970
You can check that out in the link, I
think we'll play around with tweet tube.

16
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:55,589
I learned about this feature about
10 minutes ago when I was just in

17
00:00:55,589 --> 00:01:00,299
chat, GPT and a little dialogue
came up talking about at mention

18
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:02,069
now I hadn't heard about it.

19
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:03,869
I dunno what it is just yet.

20
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:09,329
So we're going to use chat GPT to a learn
about it and if it does, what I think

21
00:01:09,334 --> 00:01:14,729
it does, we'll get it to create a tweet
based on the video I'm doing right now

22
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,070
using one of the GPTs I've already done.

23
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,910
what's really interesting is that
even though this feature exists, I'm

24
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:25,960
not finding any references anywhere
about it my first support of call

25
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:30,080
has been to ask the question within
ChatGPT and get it to use Bing,

26
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:34,300
unfortunately, the specific details
about app mentioned feature or not.

27
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,229
Well known.

28
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:37,160
okay, well where do I go next?

29
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,020
And the best place would
be to go to Google.

30
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:44,229
So I've headed over to Google and what
is the app mentioned feature in ChatGPT

31
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,989
Plus, there's nothing showing up.

32
00:01:46,994 --> 00:01:49,059
This is from May, 2023.

33
00:01:49,559 --> 00:01:49,679
I.

34
00:01:49,679 --> 00:01:52,919
Currently it's the 27th of January, 2024.

35
00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:56,549
One of the next steps I would
go to is just look in the news.

36
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:01,199
'cause news is the same as the main
page of Google, but it's very timely.

37
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:04,715
if we click here and use the
same feature, we've got some

38
00:02:04,715 --> 00:02:06,125
information from a week ago.

39
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:08,435
We've got some information
from November 15th.

40
00:02:08,935 --> 00:02:09,985
this feature.

41
00:02:10,055 --> 00:02:11,855
Is in chat GPT.

42
00:02:11,855 --> 00:02:16,625
I've seen it, but it's not been talked
about just yet, so I think we'll

43
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:19,805
move on to the next step and let's
figure out how to use it together.

44
00:02:19,805 --> 00:02:23,525
I've just started writing a prompt
here called Imagine You ChatGPT

45
00:02:23,525 --> 00:02:29,795
Plus had a feature built in whereby
you used the at symbol to make GPTs

46
00:02:29,885 --> 00:02:34,805
that I've created or used available
for use when I'm writing prompts.

47
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:36,305
Now, this is a.

48
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:37,440
A hallucination.

49
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,740
Now you've heard about hallucinations
in GPT, where it goes off and

50
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,600
does stuff that's not real.

51
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,230
Well, this is a human hallucination
because I have no idea what this

52
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,570
feature does, just that I've seen it.

53
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,471
what I'm gonna do is kind of
guess what I think it'll do.

54
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:56,231
Put in this particular statement, I
might just build it up and say, how

55
00:02:56,231 --> 00:02:58,241
do you think I would use this feature?

56
00:02:58,246 --> 00:03:01,691
What problems does it solve and
what are five use cases and let's

57
00:03:01,696 --> 00:03:06,491
just see what chat GPT might come
up for this particular scenario.

58
00:03:06,491 --> 00:03:11,981
ChatGPT has taken my hallucination of
what this feature might be and written

59
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:17,551
what I consider a pretty compelling use
case and feature if this is how it works.

60
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:21,521
So if ChatGPT Plus had a feature
that allowed you to use an

61
00:03:21,551 --> 00:03:23,741
at symbol to access and use.

62
00:03:23,751 --> 00:03:28,341
Different GPT models that you've used
or created, it would be a powerful

63
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:32,281
tool for various applications here's
how you might use this feature.

64
00:03:32,781 --> 00:03:36,981
You could quickly switch between
different GPT models tailored

65
00:03:36,981 --> 00:03:38,931
for specific tasks or expertise.

66
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:41,661
So recently I did seven or eight.

67
00:03:41,716 --> 00:03:45,796
Videos on GPTs that I created
around content creation.

68
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:49,756
I wanted to deal with writing a
YouTube intro based off everything

69
00:03:49,756 --> 00:03:53,896
I said in the video or a YouTube
outro based off not only what I said

70
00:03:53,896 --> 00:03:58,246
in the video, but other videos in
the series that I want to link to.

71
00:03:58,526 --> 00:04:03,626
I've also got GPTs that allow me to
share my videos as tweets, LinkedIn

72
00:04:03,626 --> 00:04:07,486
posts, Facebook teasers, and even
write the YouTube description.

73
00:04:07,986 --> 00:04:12,906
What is painful about using these
GPTs at the moment is that I've gotta

74
00:04:12,906 --> 00:04:17,196
create a brand new chat window and
load it up with context each time.

75
00:04:17,376 --> 00:04:22,356
Now, if we could do something
like this switch from GPT to GPT,

76
00:04:22,856 --> 00:04:26,486
from the same conversation, that
would be an incredible feature.

77
00:04:26,986 --> 00:04:30,316
Now it goes on with the problems that
it solves to talk about some of the

78
00:04:30,316 --> 00:04:32,866
things I just mentioned, specialization.

79
00:04:32,896 --> 00:04:36,436
Each of those bots that I like
to create are really specialized,

80
00:04:36,436 --> 00:04:38,996
GPT agents, It's this one.

81
00:04:38,996 --> 00:04:43,856
Context management reduces
the need to repeatedly explain

82
00:04:43,856 --> 00:04:46,676
the context or reorient ai.

83
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:49,016
That would be an interesting capability.

84
00:04:49,226 --> 00:04:54,536
what's I find interesting around the five
here is that the first four of 'em are

85
00:04:54,596 --> 00:04:56,846
based on GPTs that I've been creating.

86
00:04:56,851 --> 00:04:59,156
So content strategy and development.

87
00:04:59,156 --> 00:05:04,586
I specialize in GPTs for YouTube content
creation, and especially with SEO.

88
00:05:05,086 --> 00:05:06,466
Educational purposes.

89
00:05:06,466 --> 00:05:10,666
I'm in the middle of doing a series
called "The Tudors", and it's basically

90
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:14,656
a bunch of tutor bots for learning
complex software applications.

91
00:05:14,896 --> 00:05:19,616
I also have a programming language that
I'm developing called KlueLess, a GPT

92
00:05:19,616 --> 00:05:24,206
meta language, and I'm doing this sort
of stuff all the time, though I don't

93
00:05:24,206 --> 00:05:29,746
have any GPT specifically in this area,
I haven't done much here, if this works

94
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:34,216
the way it's describing here, I'm gonna
be really happy with this new feature.

95
00:05:34,716 --> 00:05:38,076
What I think I'll do is I'll
just use speech to text and we'll

96
00:05:38,076 --> 00:05:39,636
just type a prompt right now.

97
00:05:40,136 --> 00:05:44,876
Everything that we've talked about above
is exactly what this feature is about.

98
00:05:45,266 --> 00:05:50,336
What I would like you to do is take the
information and run it through my Twitter

99
00:05:50,576 --> 00:05:57,446
creation bot and create a tweet for me,
what we'll do is we'll just type at.

100
00:05:57,986 --> 00:05:59,259
Tweet tube.

101
00:05:59,809 --> 00:06:04,759
Talking to Tweet tube is what it does,
and we've just got this prompt and

102
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:08,779
we'll press it, enter, and we'll see
whether it does what I expect it to do.

103
00:06:09,329 --> 00:06:09,699
wow.

104
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,289
This is it it's writing tweets
the way my tweet tube bot does.

105
00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:18,869
So discover the power of customization
with ChatGPT Plus @mention feature,

106
00:06:19,209 --> 00:06:25,089
instantly switch between specialized GPT
models for tailored responses, perfect

107
00:06:25,089 --> 00:06:30,249
for content strategists, educators,
tech pros, writers, and polyglots.

108
00:06:30,249 --> 00:06:32,959
That's people that work in
multiple languages, it's

109
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,519
put in a bunch of hashtags.

110
00:06:34,909 --> 00:06:39,769
One of the problems I tend to have with
my tweet bot is sometimes it's a couple

111
00:06:39,769 --> 00:06:45,319
of letters over the 144 character length,
sometimes I've gotta modify it a bit.

112
00:06:45,324 --> 00:06:48,519
But usually this is a one hit
wonder I'm really happy with this.

113
00:06:48,649 --> 00:06:49,639
this is cool already.

114
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:54,139
I'm already sold on this feature, but
maybe I could create an intro for this

115
00:06:54,144 --> 00:06:57,545
particular video that I'm recording
I think what I'll do is I'll create

116
00:06:57,545 --> 00:07:02,045
the YouTube intro for this video, but
I'm a little confused at the moment.

117
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:06,095
It says I'm still talking to the
tweet tube, so I believe we'll just

118
00:07:06,095 --> 00:07:09,515
press this cross looks good type in.

119
00:07:10,015 --> 00:07:16,265
Can you take me over to
the at YouTube intro, GPT?

120
00:07:16,765 --> 00:07:20,395
And allow me to configure it
so that we can create a YouTube

121
00:07:20,395 --> 00:07:21,925
intro for this particular video.

122
00:07:22,425 --> 00:07:28,915
Looks like I might have to type this in,
so we'll go, @, intro maker, press enter.

123
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:34,325
it's taken me over to my bot, and my
bot has basic configuration in it.

124
00:07:34,325 --> 00:07:37,925
the YouTube Intro Maker Bot
has a configuration capability.

125
00:07:37,925 --> 00:07:39,215
Now it talks about it here.

126
00:07:39,585 --> 00:07:42,645
the niche we're going for is GPT plus.

127
00:07:42,645 --> 00:07:45,105
The topic is that there's a
feature announcement called

128
00:07:45,405 --> 00:07:48,375
at mentions in chat, GPT plus.

129
00:07:48,465 --> 00:07:49,455
Now the framework.

130
00:07:49,455 --> 00:07:52,635
You can use marketing
frameworks like AIDA and PAS.

131
00:07:52,635 --> 00:07:56,805
PAS is problem agitation solution,
but I like to keep things fairly

132
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,305
simple, so I'll go with none.

133
00:07:58,545 --> 00:07:59,415
Keep it simple.

134
00:07:59,565 --> 00:08:01,545
And the structure I think we want.

135
00:08:01,935 --> 00:08:04,335
Is problem solution, what's the problem?

136
00:08:04,575 --> 00:08:07,515
Here's the solution and the tone excited.

137
00:08:07,515 --> 00:08:10,520
I think this is an awesome
feature, but keep it professional.

138
00:08:10,525 --> 00:08:12,085
we'll just press enter on that.

139
00:08:12,455 --> 00:08:16,710
I think we can just say create is
one of the commands I think we'll

140
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:19,700
copy from here all the way through.

141
00:08:19,755 --> 00:08:23,445
fact sheet that you would want for
a script on this sort of video.

142
00:08:23,755 --> 00:08:26,000
we'll move down to the bottom
and we'll just say, create an

143
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,550
intro based on this concept.

144
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,491
We have a starter intro script
welcome to the future of AI

145
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,650
customization and efficiency.

146
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:39,530
Today we're unveiling an extraordinary
feature in ChatGPT Plus, the

147
00:08:39,621 --> 00:08:43,400
AT feature simple yet powerful
tool that's changing the game.

148
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:44,800
problem highlight.

149
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:48,310
Have you ever found yourself wishing
for a more specialized, efficient,

150
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,381
and integrated AI experience?

151
00:08:50,471 --> 00:08:55,841
This is my issue all the time with ChatGPT
one that understands your specific needs

152
00:08:55,841 --> 00:09:00,700
without having to switch contacts or
explain repeatedly your weight is over.

153
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:05,295
And then the solution with the
@ feature in ChatGPT Plus, you now

154
00:09:05,346 --> 00:09:09,396
have the ability to quickly access
various GPT models tailored for

155
00:09:09,396 --> 00:09:11,886
unique tasks and areas of expertise.

156
00:09:12,065 --> 00:09:14,555
Now it goes on, it's got use cases.

157
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:17,490
I wouldn't work with this because
Personally want to use use

158
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,560
cases that I've created myself.

159
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:25,491
What we could do is just state
this intro is really good.

160
00:09:25,496 --> 00:09:29,751
I love the first three paragraphs,
but it's way too long at the moment.

161
00:09:30,231 --> 00:09:34,670
Everything goes for about one minute
and 30 seconds to two minutes.

162
00:09:34,761 --> 00:09:39,060
I really need this to
be a 30 second script.

163
00:09:39,641 --> 00:09:42,781

model for marketing insights to at

169
00:10:08,592 --> 00:10:10,452
Python helper for coding support.

170
00:10:10,752 --> 00:10:16,002
Embrace the new era of specialized AI
with ChatGPT Plus experience efficiency

171
00:10:16,007 --> 00:10:17,922
and customization like never before.

172
00:10:18,222 --> 00:10:22,302
with a little bit of tweaking would
be a good introduction to the video.

173
00:10:22,482 --> 00:10:25,452
I think while we're at it, let's
just switch one more context.

174
00:10:25,452 --> 00:10:28,332
can you create an article
for me on LinkedIn?

175
00:10:28,832 --> 00:10:34,732
at Link Tube and the idea of
the Link Tube article generator

176
00:10:34,737 --> 00:10:36,892
is it's a single shot prompt.

177
00:10:36,892 --> 00:10:38,812
It'll get it right most times.

178
00:10:38,912 --> 00:10:44,072
it's designed specifically around turning
YouTube videos into LinkedIn articles.

179
00:10:44,292 --> 00:10:46,152
Now, this was a little unexpected.

180
00:10:46,152 --> 00:10:47,412
I know what the issue is.

181
00:10:47,462 --> 00:10:49,852
certainly I can use, the feature.

182
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:54,202
I need a bit more information, like
target audience, key message I use

183
00:10:54,207 --> 00:10:59,692
commands to drive my GPTs, and I didn't
use a command this time, so it's.

184
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:04,152
Gone into the automatic configuration
options, don't really need that.

185
00:11:04,152 --> 00:11:08,292
I'm just gonna say create, and
I'm gonna paste this in, which is

186
00:11:08,297 --> 00:11:10,062
basically the script from earlier.

187
00:11:10,242 --> 00:11:14,202
Usually when I do a create command
for a LinkedIn post, I would also

188
00:11:14,202 --> 00:11:17,082
give it the title and the YouTube
video, but we haven't created the

189
00:11:17,082 --> 00:11:18,972
YouTube video yet, we can't do that.

190
00:11:19,222 --> 00:11:22,762
just go create like that
and see what happens now.

191
00:11:23,262 --> 00:11:26,022
We've got a title, which may be
the title that we want to use.

192
00:11:26,022 --> 00:11:32,412
I would usually use my TitleGPT to
generate this revolutionizing AI

193
00:11:32,542 --> 00:11:36,882
interactions, the @ feature in ChatGPT
Plus, I think that might be good enough

194
00:11:36,882 --> 00:11:38,922
for the video anyway, introduction.

195
00:11:39,102 --> 00:11:42,252
In the ever evolving world of
artificial intelligence, we've

196
00:11:42,252 --> 00:11:48,032
got concepts, problems, practical
use, cases, and conclusions.

197
00:11:48,252 --> 00:11:51,582
Can you add emojis and hashtags please?

198
00:11:52,082 --> 00:11:56,132
let it rewrite the article now
with a couple of emojis so that

199
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:59,912
when I paste it into my LinkedIn
page, it just looks, nicer.

200
00:12:00,412 --> 00:12:02,422
We've got our LinkedIn article written.

201
00:12:02,422 --> 00:12:04,852
There's a couple of hashtags
going on down the end.

202
00:12:05,352 --> 00:12:09,942
Let's finish off the video and we might
as well use the OutroGPT to do that.

203
00:12:10,192 --> 00:12:16,002
tube outro writer, and we're in it, and
we'll just go straight into a config

204
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:21,287
So we'll just configure it and we'll
go with a style here called recap.

205
00:12:21,377 --> 00:12:25,667
So whatever we've said in the video,
we wanna recap it, but I only want

206
00:12:25,667 --> 00:12:29,807
it to go for about 15 seconds and
I wanna have a link to a playlist.

207
00:12:29,947 --> 00:12:34,237
I believe in this case I've done
YouTube automation, GPTs, there's

208
00:12:34,237 --> 00:12:38,437
a bunch of 'em all in a playlist,
and that's what we should mention.

209
00:12:38,937 --> 00:12:41,807
Let's just type create should be enough.

210
00:12:42,307 --> 00:12:48,937
That's a wrap on the Revolutionary App
feature in ChatGPT Plus, tailor your AI

I use a teleprompter and I'll read the

218
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:17,057
script that we were just looking at.

219
00:13:17,057 --> 00:13:21,947
Now, I'm going to do that, but I'm going
to look at the script that I just created.

220
00:13:21,947 --> 00:13:23,747
I'm not going to pre-prepare it.

221
00:13:23,927 --> 00:13:25,277
I'm not gonna do any editing.

222
00:13:25,277 --> 00:13:28,577
We'll just use it the way it
is, so it goes, that's a wrap.
