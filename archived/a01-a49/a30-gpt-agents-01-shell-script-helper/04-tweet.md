### Title

Unlock the Power of GPTs: Shell Script Writer for ChatGPT

### Intro

Do you want to simplify the way you build terminal scripts?

Join me on a unique scripting adventure where I'll be using a custom GPT agent, the 'Shell Script Helper,' to transform the way I build shell scripts. 

Today's challenge? I'm going to apply a script crafted with this GPT to seamlessly compile individual recordings from a video into neatly organized chapters.

Let's dive in


### Summary

The video features the development and utilization of a custom GPT agent, named "Shell Script Helper," created to assist in writing and debugging shell scripts. The agent specializes in scripts with multiple parameters and includes a unique 'code' command for memorizing code. The main demonstration involves creating a script to compile video recordings into chapter-based segments using ffmpeg. This script undergoes iterative development and debugging, with adjustments for directory paths and regular expression patterns. Additionally, the creator sets up an environment for running the scripts system-wide, including creating a scripts directory, modifying permissions, and configuring PATH settings. The project culminates in a successful script that efficiently processes and compiles videos into chapters, showcasing the agent's effectiveness in facilitating script development and potential for broader shell scripting applications.
