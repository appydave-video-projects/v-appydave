00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:05,600
I recently added buy me a Coffee as a fundraising mechanism to my YouTube channel, 

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:09,930
and in this video what I thought I'd do was take you through the complete process 

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:14,520
of set up everything that I went through, the areas that I love, the areas that I 

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,780
don't specifically need, but you might find useful.

5
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,370
I'm a content creator with a small YouTube channel that's currently not monetized, 

6
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:27,260
but over the last 12 months that I've got this channel going, I've had a couple of 

7
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:32,630
breakout videos. One in particular got 21,000 views, but I didn't have anything in 

8
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:38,330
place to potentially financially monetize that traffic. So in this video I wanna 

9
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:43,880
show you how you can set up and use buy me a coffee to solve that particular problem.

10
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:48,520
So why would you use buy me a coffee? Well, basically it's designed for people like 

11
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:54,310
myself who are content creators or YouTubers can be used for entertainers, musicians, 

12
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:58,540
anyone that's trying to promote themselves. And they're still quite small and they 

13
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:03,940
want a simple and easy platform. So what makes it beneficial over something like 

14
00:01:04,00 --> 00:01:09,310
Patreon is that it's got a little bit cheaper fees and it's easier to set up and 

15
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:14,500
compared to something like the Super Likes from YouTube where they'll automatically 

16
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:19,900
promote it to your subscriber base, which is great, but they take 30% commission. 

17
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,430
So it's a lot more beneficial to you as a creator.

18
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:29,730
Now, I was talking to a mentor of mine about how do I turn YouTube into a business 

19
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:34,440
and based on a bunch of influencers and this mentor, he said this would be a simple 

20
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:39,360
way to get started. So I thought I'd just take you through the process that I'm going 

21
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,610
through right now to set up buy me a coffee for, in this case, the username AppyDave.

22
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:50,200
When you go to the create account page, it already saved Buy me a coffee.com/ and 

23
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,190
for me, I just used my YouTube handle AppyDave. And from there, just start filling 

24
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:01,590
in the standard signup capabilities. I'm using a username and password here. Now 

25
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,990
this will take you to the profile setup screen. 

26
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,120
So very simply fill in your brand name. 

27
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:11,120
in this case, I've put in a little bit of an About us and a link to my website. After 

28
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:14,990
that, I just took my standard brand image and uploaded it.

29
00:02:15,00 --> 00:02:20,350
Now next it'll ask you how you plan to use Buy me a coffee. Now you can use it as 

30
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:25,750
a membership system, a shop, a blog posts that are exclusive to your members. We've 

31
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:31,900
also got the email list and marketing. Now for myself, I'm only looking as a support 

32
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:32,740
platform. Just 

33
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:38,360
some extra income that comes through. And the reason for that is that I'm using Kajabi 

34
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,920
in my day-to-Day business work. 

35
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,950
So when you press next your door asks you to start setting up your payment. 

36
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:49,330
here I've set up Australia in my particular case and it's taken to me to this area 

37
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,830
about setting up Stripe. 

38
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:54,930
I've filled in a username and password that I had for Stripe, but I haven't used 

39
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,550
Stripe in about four years. 

40
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,610
it took me through a bit of a process here and I'll show what I went through. 

41
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:03,160
firstly it said, welcome back, try to sign in. 

42
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:09,110
I did that and it said, verify that you own this account and it required some serious 

43
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:11,390
documentation, passport 

44
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:15,890
photos and QR codes. But once I got through all of this, it said, you're all set. 

45
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:16,940
We can get going. 

46
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:21,490
then I was able to set up two factor authentication, which would be really important 

47
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:25,660
because this is a banking system. Money is coming through to you. So make sure you 

48
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:26,230
do that. 

49
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,310
then it takes you to the dashboard. 

50
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:34,930
I have 57 cents available for me from what looks to be six years ago back in 2018.

51
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:39,560
Coming outta Stripe, we come back to the homepage of Buy me a coffee. And from here 

52
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:44,300
you'll see that there's a link called View page right here. And there's also another 

53
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:48,410
one over on the right called share page. And if you click on that, that'll take you 

54
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:54,800
to the public page that your supporters will see. And what they would do is generally 

55
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:59,600
fill in this particular form, and once that's done, they'll end up as a supporter 

56
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,160
here in the list page.

57
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:05,190
One of the things that makes buy me a coffee so brilliant is that you don't pay for 

58
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:10,410
this platform yet. You have access to capabilities like recurring income through 

59
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:15,810
the membership system, and from this, you can make content of yours available to 

60
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:19,950
people that are your members. On top of that, you can also set up a shop, so you 

61
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:24,660
don't need to pay for Shopify. You can have your own e-commerce platform up and running 

62
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,730
where you can sell some of your merchandise. 

63
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:31,770
lastly, you've got a blogging platform, so you don't need to set up Wix or WordPress 

64
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:36,150
or anything else like that. You just come in, create your posts. Again, you can make 

65
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:41,940
these available just for your subscribers. Now, I don't use this. Instead I'm using 

66
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:47,130
Kajabi and I have a video in the link if you wanna find out more about Kajabi because 

67
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:52,200
it's great for me as a course and content creator where I'm marketing courses. 

68
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:56,980
but if you just need something affordable to get started, then buy me a coffee. Has 

69
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,350
pretty much all the capabilities you need.

70
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,440
when it comes to marketing, they've got you covered here with graphics and buttons, 

71
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,120
images and shareables. 

72
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:10,170
you can put a website button on for buy me a coffee. We've got the widget where people 

73
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:14,640
can interact and select the amount of money that they wanna send you. You've got 

74
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:18,960
the stream alerts, so when you are streaming and someone pay you some money, that 

75
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,250
you can use these sorts of graphics directly in your live stream. Or if you wanna 

76
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:26,490
make it simple for people, give them access to a QR code.

77
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:31,30
Now when it comes to workflow integrations, they've got you sorted here. So when 

78
00:05:31,30 --> 00:05:36,700
a buy me a coffee comes in, you can have a tweet sent out to your X account automatically. 

79
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:41,740
You can give people in your Discord server different roles and capabilities. It can 

80
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:45,880
be integrated into WordPress, and if you just need full flexibility, it works with 

81
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,900
Zapier as well.

82
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:51,680
Now let's go on to setting up being paid out. So the first thing you do is head over 

83
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,690
to settings. You can set a goal and one of the areas you can do is set up your payments. 

84
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:01,490
From here we select the country that you're in. In my case, I'm in Australia and 

85
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:06,770
we need to enter in our bank account details. So I've put in my email address and 

86
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:12,230
my phone number After that, set up the legal business entity that you're using. I 

87
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:17,930
don't have a A BN just yet, so I'm just going to get it started and fill that in 

88
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:22,730
later. After that, you just need to verify your details. So we've got my home address, 

89
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:26,600
we've got legal name, and from there we can set up the bank account where you want 

90
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:32,450
money to go. So I filled it in, had it all confirmed. It asks you to review and submit. 

91
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,130
Once you've done all of that, 

92
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:37,750
It'll say connected to payout account for your name, David. 

93
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:42,600
now, when anyone ever goes to your buy me a coffee, personalized URL, they'll be 

94
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,160
taken to a screen like this with your name, your picture, what you're about, and 

95
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,860
the ability for them to buy you a coffee.

96
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:54,570
So that's the setup process for Buy Me a Coffee. It's great for any content creator 

97
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:59,480
who wants to start monetizing their channel. I'm AppyDave I do videos on ChatGPT,

100
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,530
That'll probably be on an AI tool or prompt engineering.
