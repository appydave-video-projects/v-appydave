00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:05,400
I love using ChatGPT to write my code, but of late I've been experimenting with the 

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:11,660
other tools. So we have CursorAI, Aider, and recently we've got GPT canvas. And what 

3
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:16,790
I love about all these tools is that they can do really good code generation, but 

4
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:20,640
they're only as good as the context you give them. And the context we're talking 

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,160
about is documentation.

6
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:27,760
So in CursorAI the way you give context in the form of documentation is you head 

7
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,390
over to the settings and you'll see that part of the context will come from your 

8
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:31,990
code base. 

9
00:00:32,00 --> 00:00:36,130
then another part of it will come from the documentation you provided by uploading 

10
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:37,530
or providing URLs.

11
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:43,730
So what I'd like to do today is take two open source repos. The first one is Handlebars.js. 

12
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:48,620
The second one is cmdlet. And with cmdlet, it's just wrapping function calls within 

13
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:54,440
the command pattern, and Handlebars.js is wrapping those same Commandlets inside 

14
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,730
of handlebars. Helpers.

15
00:00:55,730 --> 00:01:01,410
Now, these two public repositories are actually internal projects that I use myself. 

16
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:05,640
I don't usually tell people too much about them, and what happened this morning was 

17
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:11,100
that I was creating a new project called k_template, which I wanted to have use those 

18
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:15,600
two projects. And when I went looking at them, we've got cmdlet here and we've got 

19
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:20,310
Handlebars.js. They've both got similar version numbers because they work in tandem. 

20
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:24,500
I went looking through the code for both of them, and we can see that it's a couple 

21
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:29,230
of years since I've worked on these projects. And then I thought, well, let's have 

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:33,460
a look at the documentation. So I've come down, I've got stories, I've got usage 

23
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:38,290
examples. And when I opened it up, there was no documentation here. When I went over 

24
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:43,810
to the cmdlet and I opened up the same files I saw, they too had no documentation. 

25
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:49,150
since I need documentation from these for the k_template system, I thought let's 

26
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,220
go and generate documentation today.

27
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:56,310
I've opened up the cmdlet project within Cursor AI. And what we'll do is we'll start 

28
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,430
by just creating some documentation area. 

29
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,550
we'll create a folder called docs. 

30
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:06,180
within it we'll put in a file called usage.md. Now to figure out what we want to 

31
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:12,330
do usage on I've got this little tool that I have GPT context. And it's just going 

32
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:16,530
to gather files and present them in a tree format. And we can see here that we've 

33
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:22,380
got say a area called case. And this is where things like camel case, title case 

34
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:27,660
or making it upper or dash case can all be done using individual commands. We've 

35
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:32,610
got all the comparison operators greater than or equal to. We've got pluralization 

36
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:37,620
and singularization. And what I'd like to do is create documentation around all of 

37
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,120
these on how you would use it.

38
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:42,980
Now I've just come over to usage and I'm going to press command L. 

39
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:47,880
what that'll do is open up a chat window focusing in on the file that we were looking 

40
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,960
at. 

41
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:52,230
I'll just paste in this little prompt. Can you read through the following files and 

42
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:57,120
give me documentation, format or structure that can help convey usage instructions 

43
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,590
to developers. 

44
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,770
from here we can press the @ sign 

45
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:04,790
the folder we want will be the lib directory. So what I'm basically saying is this 

46
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:08,720
is where you can find the code. We can already see visually what it should look like. 

47
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,250
So it's reading through that at the moment. And it's now going to start giving us 

48
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,450
some ideas.

49
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:19,170
Let's have a look through it. So Commandlet usage guide. And we've got introduction 

50
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:22,710
installation configuration and then available cmdlets. 

51
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:26,780
good thing is it looks like it's grouped them by the subfolders we're talking about. 

52
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:31,940
we have array operations going on here. We've got inflection. Is that listed. It 

53
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:36,620
certainly is miscellaneous which is showing up here. This looks good. We've got an 

54
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,710
introduction installation and configuration. 

55
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:42,380
we've got a little bit of an issue here. Not sure what's going on. 

56
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:45,560
then the list of them are all available in markdown format. 

57
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:50,920
I think we can just go to the top here and press this button. Can we exit out of 

58
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:54,520
that? We can and we'll just accept it.

59
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,130
it's taken over the first section. 

60
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:00,330
where this error was, it didn't know how to read it. So we'll just manually put that 

61
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:04,830
in. And I think it needs to have three ticks like that. So we'll just close them 

62
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:05,820
off as well. 

63
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,490
Let's click on 

64
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:11,130
apply to usage. We'll press continue and we'll see whether it gets added to the end. 

65
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:13,590
It does. We'll press command Y.

66
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:17,220
let's have a look at the documentation. We'll close down the chat. I think we'll 

67
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:21,510
close down the explorer. And I've got a little button here that allows us to visualize 

68
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:27,690
it as markdown. And we can see our documentation has started to come together, at 

69
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:32,430
which point we might be wanting to expand on this information. We can write it ourselves 

70
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,450
or we could use Cursor in this case. 

71
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,740
I've come back to the same chat window with the usage.md, 

72
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:42,440
we'll head to the bottom and put in a new prompt. Can you give me code usage examples 

73
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:47,240
with sample inputs and outputs for each cmdlet, you should be able to find the examples 

74
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:47,510
here. 

75
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:52,280
give it a folder for where it could find some. So we'll type in folders and from 

76
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:58,370
there we'll press Spec unit tests and it should start reading through the unit tests 

77
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:00,920
which exist for each of these cmdlets. 

78
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:05,440
hopefully there's good examples in here. Usage instructions.

79
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,880
it looks like we've got some information coming in. 

80
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:12,620
if you wanted to join some values together with a delimiter between them. So we've 

81
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:18,460
got one two, three. It's doing the comma separation. It's got ABC with pipes and 

82
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,120
we see the pipes coming through. 

83
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:22,600
Let's look at the dash notation. 

84
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:26,880
the quick brown fox. And we've also got the ability to deal with numbers correctly. 

85
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,550
So there's no dash between the five and the 666 which is exactly what I want to see. 

86
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,880
let's press apply and see what that starts to do.

87
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,630
Now, this is a great time to point out the problems that you can have with Cursor 

88
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:45,240
AI. So at the moment when I press apply, nothing is really happening. If I press 

89
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:50,400
continue, it looks like something's going on. We should see an accept. Well, look 

90
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:50,910
at that. We got it. 

91
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:55,160
So nothing was happening for a few examples, until I started recording again 

92
00:05:55,230 --> 00:06:01,400
What I've decided to do is go and take the example. It's just written, and I've wrapped 

93
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:07,640
in some extra structure to the document here, and we'll just move down to this location. 

94
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:12,440
Hopefully we can see the join post come through at this location, and hopefully it'll 

95
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,260
also follow the format that we're seeing here. 

96
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:19,760
it looks like that's worked. We can press command. Yes, 

97
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:24,500
yes. And I don't know that I need the example for join. So we'll remove that from 

98
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:30,290
the system. We'll remove that and we'll come down to here I'll press save and let's 

99
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,730
work on the next one. 

100
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:37,670
So let's go back to the top and we're missing the join pre. So that's a little bit 

101
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:42,770
of an issue as well. But I'm just going to work on the next one in the list. So this 

102
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:48,110
is case transformations. We'll press apply and we'll go with continue I'm hoping 

103
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:53,540
that we'll see something here. Now again this is looks like it's going to fail 

104
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,180
So I've manually put in another heading for the next group case transformations. 

105
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:05,110
I've started off with backslash and we'll do an apply on that. Press continue and 

106
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:10,480
see if it figures out where to place it looks like it has. We'll press command Y. 

107
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:15,250
We've got another example coming through. Then we'll go to camel. We'll press apply 

108
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,800
on that and continue. 

109
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:20,740
And we'll press command Y on that. 

110
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:25,960
So I'm two in and I've run into another problem, which is interesting. I think we 

111
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,910
can fix it. When we look at the code that's coming through on the right. It's not. 

112
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:35,980
It's cherry picking the files from that particular folder. So what we should be able 

113
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:40,120
to do is head over to the terminal and we'll just run this little command here, which 

114
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:46,330
is going to find all the files that are in the case changing folder. This is really 

115
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:50,740
the order I want stuff to go. So that's now in my clipboard. Now that I've run that.

116
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:55,900
So we've got two here and we've got everything in the right order. Now it's in alphabetical 

117
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:01,330
order. So let's just apply this first one. Press continue and see what happens. Now 

118
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:06,970
I'd already tried doing multiple at the same time and it doesn't provide a good user 

119
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:12,730
experience. So I'm just going to let them come through one at a time. So now we're 

120
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:19,300
on to dash. We'll press continue and we'll get ready over here. And that's the right 

121
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:24,910
location. We'll press command Y and we'll move on to Dot and press continue.

122
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:31,990
Let it come in and onto double colon. There's a little bit tedious the way this works. 

123
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:37,570
I'm still getting used to using Cursor. I think there are better ways that we can 

124
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:44,560
solve these problems, but it's still pretty decent. Go on to human press. Continue 

125
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:50,570
still waiting. Command y. And then all of a sudden it just jumped ahead. And that 

126
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:54,920
gave me some indication of what could have been the issue. I've seen this before 

127
00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:00,200
with Cursor, that maybe it was still writing files down in the chat window and it 

128
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,310
couldn't move ahead as quickly. Or maybe it's a different issue, but looks like we've 

129
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:09,650
got most of them in place for that one particular section, which is the case. Transformation.

130
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:15,360
Now circling back to the array operations. It had missed one of them. And we can 

131
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,440
press command I in this case just to work on this particular area. 

132
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:25,350
we'll put in a prompt. Can you add documentation for join pre. And hopefully it will 

133
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:31,770
find the right information. And this is looking good. We'll just press command Y 

134
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:35,610
on that. There's an accept all. Let's press that and see what it does. 

135
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:40,280
Let's just have a quick run of the documentation. We've got the complete examples. 

136
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:45,920
And here's the array operations currently only three. They're all joins with delimiters. 

137
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,420
And some of them the delimiter can be at the end or it can be at the beginning. If 

138
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:55,670
we move into the case transformations we've got things like backslash camel case 

139
00:09:55,670 --> 00:10:02,630
constant sort of notation dash dots double colons. So all of this I use generally 

140
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:07,790
in handlebars helpers. But I also use this within other libraries within the system, 

141
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:10,670
which is why it's isolated out to its own command.

142
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:14,840
So we'll come back up to the index and we'll just move on to the next section. We'll 

143
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:18,320
try and do it all in one go. So we'll press command L, 

144
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:24,720
we should actually go back to the last conversation that we were on. We'll say can 

145
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:31,290
you add to the documentation misspell there. That's okay. We'll just paste everything 

146
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:36,930
in and see what it comes up with. And we'll also move down where hopefully it's going 

147
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:40,500
to come in in around this particular location.

148
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:45,900
You can see here using the chat window that has come through malformed again, and 

149
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:50,160
this is going to be difficult to copy over manually. I'll try another approach. What 

150
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,870
I'll do is I'll put in comparison operations. That's the next section. In this case 

151
00:10:54,870 --> 00:11:00,480
I'll press command I and I'm just going to go can you add to the documentation. And 

152
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,620
I'm just listing the actual commands that are related to comparison. 

153
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:10,630
Now it's just finished generating. I don't see anything. I'm expecting line 311 for 

154
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:15,730
information to be loaded. Let's just move up. Look at that. It's pasted it up here. 

155
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,860
Now, I could accept it, but the problem is it's going to clear this area out. I wonder 

156
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:25,330
if we can say code is okay

157
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:35,490
but in wrong location, and we'll just say should be at 311. Press enter

158
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:41,190
now it's finished. It didn't really do the right thing, but it is better because 

159
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,970
at the moment it's not going to delete this section. So what I think we can do is 

160
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:50,580
just press command Y, we'll accept all that information and we'll just find the end 

161
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:56,220
of it. And that's the end there. We'll press command X and we've just cut it and 

162
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:01,680
we'll just paste it in here and press save before it goes and destroys any code on 

163
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:01,980
me.

164
00:12:02,00 --> 00:12:06,500
let's take what we learned from that last one. I'm going to move on to trying to 

165
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:10,640
do the last three all in one hit. And we'll go down to the bottom. And I've said, 

166
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:18,950
put it here. We'll press command I and say, can you continue with documentation.

167
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:24,530
then I've said and place it at, put it here and we'll paste in all that information 

168
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:29,780
we've got. And what's interesting with the user interface here is that I've pasted 

169
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:34,550
lines that have carriage returns in them, and you can't see anything here. I'm not 

170
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:40,100
sure if it works. So we'll press enter. Yeah. Look at that. It hasn't put the information. 

171
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:45,380
Now if I paste it here you'll see that it was in my clipboard. It just doesn't go 

172
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:49,460
into the chat window for some reason. So I don't have any faith that this is going 

173
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:55,940
to work. Now. Luckily I've been proven wrong. So everything has worked. What's been 

174
00:12:55,940 --> 00:13:00,530
a bit of a problem is the user experience is a little challenging because you can't 

175
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:05,60
see what's going on. I'm just going to press accept all on that. Do I need to press 

176
00:13:05,60 --> 00:13:10,100
save all? Let's do a save all, see what it does and we'll and we'll come back. We've 

177
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:15,140
got the information operations going on. And if we move down a bit further we've 

178
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,510
got the miscellaneous operations.

179
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:22,840
So let's go check out the final documentation. So before we had page not found for 

180
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:29,230
usage. And if we do a refresh we are on 13.2 at the moment. If we refresh this now 

181
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:31,300
we're now up to 14.0. 

182
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:36,600
with that there should be new usage information going on. So let's just click on 

183
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:36,360
that 

184
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:42,380
We've got documentation. Now the hyperlinks that we've got going on probably need 

185
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:46,730
to be added into this area as well. But we can see the different sections. 

186
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:50,710
here's the pluralization which is inflection operations. 

187
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:57,650
what happens when you want to get the ordinal of a number. So first second third 

188
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:04,190
or including the number 21st the 11th. How do we pluralize. How do we pluralize numbers. 

189
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:11,360
How do we singular rise? How do we get rid of the plurals. So books becomes book 

190
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,580
And then there's some miscellaneous operations like converting into JSON safe and 

191
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,180
padding.
