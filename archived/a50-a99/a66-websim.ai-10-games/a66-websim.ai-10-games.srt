00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:04,350
In this video, I'm going to show you how to create 10 different games using WebSim.ai 

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,810
It's a follow up to the video I did last week on building a component for a GPT Agent 

3
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:15,390
framework. What we'll look at are classic games like Tetris, asteroids, and Wordle, 

4
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:21,110
but also more modern style of games that might be useful in an AI agent framework. 

5
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,270
I'm AppyDave. Let's get into it.

6
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:28,330
Head over to Google and type in WebSim.ai and when you click on the link, you'll 

7
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:33,850
be brought to a screen like this. And down below are a bunch of games and applications 

8
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:35,980
that people have already created. 

9
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:42,150
Now, last week in my first looks at WebSim.ai I took an application that I have a 

10
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:46,710
GPT Workflow engine and I was able to add in this new component 

11
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:52,330
and it allowed me to go backwards and forwards by clicking here and ending back on 

12
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:58,510
a workflow screen. Now all of this took me about 20 minutes just using WebSim.ai 

13
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:00,130
to do the work.

14
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:05,530
So from here we'll head back to Web simm ai, and this is where you can start a new 

15
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:09,400
application just by writing a prompt. One of the things that you can do is select 

16
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,750
the large language model. 

17
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:15,350
I'm just going to work with Sonnet 3.5. That's what I used last time and it worked 

18
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,130
quite well. 

19
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:21,110
But let's work out what it is we're going to build. So if we head over to ChatGPT, 

20
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:27,410
I've written this prompt here that says you are going to help me to create 10 different 

21
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:32,480
games. The game's gonna be written in HTML in JavaScript, and that they're going 

22
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:38,420
to be using online artificial intelligence tool called WebSim.ai So one of the things 

23
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:45,110
I've asked it to do is do a search for WebSim.ai so it understands how this tool 

24
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:51,170
sort of works. And I've also said I want the prompts to be fairly simple and clear 

25
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:56,930
when we are doing this. So I'm trying to find software products or applications from 

26
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:59,30
the past games that have been 

27
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:04,700
relatively simple to create. And what it's done is given a list of 20 ideas that 

28
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:09,380
we can work with. So I've just enhanced that prompt a little bit further so that 

29
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:15,500
we can get two different examples for each of the 20 games. So got things like Pong 

30
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,590
and breakout from back in the seventies, 

31
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:25,660
and Tetris from 1984. So what I've done is then just asked it to give me a short 

32
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:30,400
list. Currently it's given me nine, and we'll see that I will get it up to 10 at 

33
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,840
the end. But before I did that, I thought let's get some images together to see how 

34
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,340
these could look. And so these are the images I'll use on the thumbnail. We've got 

35
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:44,830
Atari, we've got missile command. We may make that one. We'll see. I think S Space 

36
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:49,540
Invaders would be a great game to CR create. And then we got on the Nokia. There 

37
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:55,270
was a snake game when I asked it to do number five, which was Pacman. It said there's 

38
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:01,600
a content policy issue, so I just asked it to rename it to GPT Man. And so we'll 

39
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,430
create some sort of Pacman clone, 

40
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,620
followed by a tower defense. 

41
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:08,410
then we can finish off with Asteroids, Wordle, 

42
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:13,410
and Tetris. Now that was the original nine it came up with, but I thought I'd love 

43
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:18,960
to see Donkey Kong and hopefully we can round it out to 10 different games in this 

44
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,410
video.

45
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:24,680
let's work on the first game. It's the Atari breakout game, and what I've done is 

46
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:29,420
created a little prompt. If I wanted to describe the creation of the game breakout 

47
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:34,850
as a short requirement, spec, and also a separate chain of responsibility, prompt, 

48
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:41,450
how would I do that? Now, what we've got here is a pretty clear list of requirements 

49
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:46,550
for the breakout game. We've got game elements, mechanics, graphics, and design. 

50
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:53,150
The only thing, technical requirements using H-T-M-L-C-S-S and JavaScript and responsive 

51
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:59,930
may not be needed because this is kind of the default that WebSim.ai would do anyway 

52
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:04,230
as a chain of responsibility. This is the sort of stuff you might do if you wanted 

53
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:07,860
to run it in something like Anthropic or ChatGPT, 

54
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:14,230
I don't know that I need to worry about it for this particular case. So I think what 

55
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:20,530
we'll do is we'll take everything from here all the way through to here, and let's 

56
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:22,630
just test it out in WebSim.ai

57
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:28,310
What we'll do is head over to WebSim.ai and we're just gonna paste all the information 

58
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:35,630
that we let ChatGPT create for us and we'll hit go. And I don't know that this will 

59
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:40,760
work. This is probably a little bit more complex than the system would know how to 

60
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,530
work with, but let's see what happens.

61
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:48,770
So we've got this breakout play. We've got score up in the left hand corner. Let's 

62
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:49,970
just see. Whoa. 

63
00:04:50,00 --> 00:04:50,960
Now 

64
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,740
it worked though. I couldn't get the actual paddle to work, 

65
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:00,420
I think we can just go in and change the prompt and see if we can add left and right 

66
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:05,760
arrows to the movement mechanism. So I've just added a prompt. Can you make the paddle 

67
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:10,320
respond to the left and right keys so that I can control movement left and right? 

68
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,430
The paddle should not go beyond the left and right edge of the screen and we will 

69
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:19,950
just press go on that and see what it creates. Now one of the things you'll notice 

70
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:26,100
is that the code is being generated and can sometimes be seen up in this blue bar. 

71
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:30,900
So we've got a little help message down here. We'll hit play. Oh, look at that. And 

72
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:30,960
that's working. 

73
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,920
And there we, 

74
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,490
wow. That's impressive. 

75
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:39,200
heading back to GPT, I just asked what are the classic colors for the game? We've 

76
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:44,360
got red, orange, yellow, green, and blue. I also asked if if there was ever a missile 

77
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:49,190
or bullet system that said there was in a game called asteroid. So I said, give me 

78
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,900
a short prompt 

79
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:55,250
what it's come up with is modify the existing breakout game, add rows with bricks 

80
00:05:55,250 --> 00:06:00,260
in the following colors, introduce a power up, ensure that the power up is visually 

81
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:06,320
distinguishable and can be activated once per game. So we'll just take this information 

82
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:12,890
right here, we'll head over and paste it in, and we press go and it'll start regenerating 

83
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:13,520
the game. 

84
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:18,500
we'll press play and look at that. We've got colors. This is looking good. I'm not 

85
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,150
a very good player at this 

86
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,930
and the space doesn't do anything. 

87
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:28,500
So the first attempt at altering the game to have colored bars worked fine, but one 

88
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:33,420
of the things it didn't do was allow the power up to work from the space bar. So 

89
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:39,930
I added in a prompt, the space bar is not firing. Can you fix this? What it did for 

90
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:45,480
me was added in this new power up, that right here it says Space to shoot when the 

91
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:51,450
power is active, but it wasn't active and I couldn't figure out how to make it active. 

92
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,760
So I just added in one more prompt 

93
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,960
and that prompt is here. Can you make sure the power up is active at the beginning 

94
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:58,380
of the game? 

95
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,530
let's just test this out and we've got it working. Looks good. 

96
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:08,750
I just pressed the space button and we saw a bullet come through. So three or four 

97
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:12,470
minutes and we've got this game of breakout. We should be able to 

98
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:17,280
put a bookmark against it. We'll keep that. And the other thing we can do if we click 

99
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,670
here is we can download the HTML to our computer. 

100
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:25,250
So we'll head over to Visual Studio and we've just opened up the HTML page that we 

101
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:31,370
downloaded. There's a bunch of CSS going on, little bit of HTML and elements all 

102
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:36,890
being dealt with in JavaScript. So the game itself is relatively simple. If we right 

103
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,800
click on it and view it as a live server, 

104
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:43,840
our gamers come up locally, we hit play. And let's say we wanna change the red to 

105
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,310
pink. What we should be able to do is just change the first set of colors here. We'll 

106
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:53,650
just make that pink and we'll hit save. And it's refresh the page and we'll hit play. 

107
00:07:53,680 --> 00:08:00,340
And we now have a pink line up the top. So, so easy to create a game. It's only a 

108
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:04,210
few minutes, and then you've got all the code and you can edit it the way you want.

109
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:09,930
Now before we move on to game number two, let's just make an alteration to our username. 

110
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:14,280
So at the moment, I'm light butterfly and a number, and what you can do is move over 

111
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,510
to the left here. 

112
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:19,940
there is a little icon here that when you click on it, you can go and change your 

113
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:20,720
username. 

114
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:25,830
I've just said a AppyDave, I've changed my avatar picture here. Other things that 

115
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:31,200
you can change is use a custom API key and the default large language model that 

116
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,130
you want to use. 

117
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:32,940
just press save 

118
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:36,170
we now have a username and logo going on here. 

119
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,320
So let's try and create the next game missile command. 

120
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:45,260
we've got is the original prompt that we did for breakout is just here, but if we 

121
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:49,670
move to the bottom and alter it a little bit, we'll say the game missile command 

122
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:54,410
as a short requirement spec. Now we didn't use the chain of responsibility, so I 

123
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:58,700
think we'll just leave it at that and press play and see what happens. 

124
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:00,960
And we've got our requirement specs. 

125
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:06,840
We'll head over to web sim and just pretty much paste everything and see what happens 

126
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,800
with the generation. 

127
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,950
We'll get a little initialization. It's still writing code at the moment. It's looking 

128
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:17,210
very similar to the last game we created. Looks like it's finished. We'll just hit 

129
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:17,750
play. 

130
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,920
Now the first iteration of this, none of the keyboard controls have worked, but what 

131
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:27,200
we do have are five cities down the bottom of the screen and we've got three missile 

132
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:27,860
silos. 

133
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:28,560
let's head over 

134
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,800
ChatGPT and we've got our original, 

135
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:36,960
prompts that we use to come up with the requirement specs. And if we focus in, you 

136
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:41,670
can see I've added this new area. Can you create a separate chain of responsibility? 

137
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:45,720
Prompt, which is what I said I didn't need this time around, but it seems I did. 

138
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,600
And what that's doing is giving us a list of actions that you could go through one 

139
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,160
at a time, which may be the better way to build games at the moment. One of the areas 

140
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:01,410
here is the game play mechanics, and this is how we should control the different 

141
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:06,900
sprites on the screen. Now it doesn't give us any information here about keyboard 

142
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:11,700
or mouse, so I'm just going to extend it a little bit. Give me the gameplay mechanics 

143
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:17,160
and include keyboard or mass controls. Make sure you specify which keyboard, 

144
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,270
controls to use. 

145
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,760
we've got 'em listed 

146
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:23,900
and we got As and D to work from the different missile silos. They're the green ones 

147
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:27,590
here. We're also going to support the mouse controls. 

148
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,330
should be able to do is just copy the information that's here, 

149
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:37,200
and I've just pasted that information directly into this area here. We've hit play 

150
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,210
and I've already done this. So what you can see is that we've now got an A to launch 

151
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:48,240
from the left S to launch from the middle and D to launch from the right. It should 

152
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,200
also work with the mouse for aiming and left clicking. 

153
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:53,30
let's give it a whirl.

154
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:58,530
So we'll just hit play and from this point we can use the mouse to just fire, or 

155
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:03,420
if we use a, it comes from the left, s from the center, and d from the right. 

156
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:08,260
so this game is working and it's taken two prompts in about five minutes of work.

157
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:12,830
At the moment, we're two down eight to go. What we can do is head over and you've 

158
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:17,900
got these areas for bookmarks, and one of the things we should be able to do is publish 

159
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,550
'em and make them live. 

160
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,940
and we'll come over to this one and press the edit button and we can publish that 

161
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:27,930
and we should be able to open that one as well. So here's the first one. Here's the 

162
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:28,530
second one. 

163
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:29,700
Everything seems to be 

164
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:30,860
working here. 

165
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:34,420
Now, just for your information, there may be a little problem you'll run into. I 

166
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:39,220
just ran into it now. So at the moment, this is the correct version of the game and 

167
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:44,590
it's all working, but when I bookmarked it, I actually had an older version of the 

168
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:48,880
application open when I did the bookmark and I couldn't undo it. I kept coming in 

169
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:54,430
here and pressing the unpublished republished, see what happened. But there's this 

170
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:58,150
little button up here that you can press called Updated, and that will just bring 

171
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:02,950
it up to, I believe, the URL that you are on. So if you have an issue where you've 

172
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:07,660
accidentally published an older version and you wanna change it, it's this little 

173
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:13,930
button here called updated that will update the actual URL to the latest version 

174
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:13,780
of your game.

175
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,700
So let's move over to the third game, 

176
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:20,710
So I said, can you describe the creation of the game Asteroids as a short requirement 

177
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:26,140
spa in two sections. Number one is just the look and feel and the general game requirements. 

178
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:31,240
And number two is the gameplay because we're finding that if we do them both together, 

179
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,430
the gameplay doesn't get done anyway. 

180
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:35,190
we'll see what it produces here. 

181
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:41,230
section one looks good. Let's just copy from this area down to here and later on 

182
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,940
we'll come back and look at this. 

183
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:47,360
Now if we go back to the last game we were working on, you can get back to the home 

184
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,130
by pressing this little button here 

185
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:54,530
and we'll just click on the prompt and paste it in and see what happens. 

186
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,180
Now it's starting to generate the game here. 

187
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,600
Neoclassic asteroids, we've got a play button. It's still loading at the moment 

188
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,260
it all looks ready. Let's see what happens if we hit play and do we have any, we 

189
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:11,120
do already have some controls, so that's a good thing to know. We may actually be 

190
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,380
working right now. 

191
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:19,330
let's go back to the GPT that we had, and I'm still going to add in some extra information. 

192
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:20,770
So we'll just click on this 

193
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,290
and 

194
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:25,910
just see what happens if we expand it. I think the main thing that I'm looking to 

195
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:31,970
get this time through is just what the controls are going to be shown visually on 

196
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:32,660
the screen. 

197
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:36,530
we've now got three lives. We've got a high 

198
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,860
score zero. 

199
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:42,660
got a little bit of a fire coming out of it now. Oh, let's get out of there and 

200
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:47,460
look. It's working just like the original asteroids. One thing we could do is improve 

201
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:51,60
the graphics a little bit, but other than that, this looks great. In fact, let's 

202
00:13:51,60 --> 00:13:56,130
just try that and we'll just test with the idea of can you make the graphics a little 

203
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:57,240
bit more realistic? 

204
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:02,970
at this point, we've got a new name for it. It's called Hyperrealistic Asteroids. 

205
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:07,440
There's a little bit of a font change going on. We're still loading at the moment, 

206
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:12,420
and that's finished. It takes about 30 to 40 seconds to generate, but let's see if 

207
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,100
it's actually working. 

208
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:19,920
So this uncovered another issue to be aware of. So I had it not work and I said the 

209
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,990
game has stopped working. And what I didn't notice was that there was the word continue 

210
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:30,660
here. So kind of like ChatGPT, uh, might just stop 

211
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:33,240
midway through a generation and you can press continue. 

212
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,900
we'll just press continue here 

213
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,590
and it's finished. We'll hit play and 

214
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,550
there we go. It looks a lot different than before. The graphics are a little bit 

215
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,350
better, which is what we're after. 

216
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:44,900
And 

217
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:45,750
fantastic. 

218
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,420
So the thing I learned here is that it worked with the original requirement spec. 

219
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:55,660
I didn't need to do the gameplay controls. This time around when I made it more hyperrealistic, 

220
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:59,260
one of the things I didn't take into consideration is that sometimes the generation 

221
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:05,560
of the game can take a lot longer than expected and it will just say continue. And 

222
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:09,340
you've gotta just look out for that. Press the continue. And here we have the updated 

223
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:13,210
game is got better graphics, but essentially it's the same game.

224
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:18,870
heading back over to the fourth game and we've got the Nokia Game Snake, and what 

225
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:22,830
I've done is altered the prompt a little bit. Can you describe the creation of the 

226
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:28,290
Game Snake as a short requirement spec? Now, I haven't split out into two sections 

227
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:32,760
so much because the controls are really easy with this game. Anyway, include the 

228
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:37,680
game, look and feel, general requirements, game mechanics and keyboard controls needed. 

229
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:42,630
I also wanna make sure from now on that we get the keyboard controls printed on the 

230
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:46,860
home screen. It didn't happen with the last one, but it has happened with others. 

231
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:50,940
So I'm just being a little bit more specific in this particular case. 

232
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:56,780
Now, this time it's gone really detailed and broken everything up. Now we've never 

233
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,550
tested this as an idea, 

234
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:03,900
I like to do is test things out. So we'll take everything. I generally probably would've 

235
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,480
made this a simpler prompt than what we're seeing, 

236
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:12,340
head back to WebSim.ai. Just click on the home button, click in here, and we'll just 

237
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:17,290
paste it all in and we'll see what comes up. Game is being generated at the moment. 

238
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:22,540
We're seeing the how to play controls going on here. So we've got up down left and 

239
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:26,290
right and play to start. Now it's still loading, 

240
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:31,220
So we will kick it off. And I'm meant to be eating the food and I missed it. 

241
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,900
And we are now longer, 

242
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:37,980
and it's getting longer as we go. So it looks like the game is working. Okay. This 

243
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:43,860
is awesome. So this actually happened in one prompt. I didn't know how to use it 

244
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,660
straight away, but this is going well.

245
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:48,770
So one of the things I've noticed here is that when you right click on areas, you 

246
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:54,110
can do this edit. So how about we take this and we'll click on edit and I'm going 

247
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,610
to type in 

248
00:16:55,630 --> 00:17:01,380
change the words, classic snake two, buymeacoffee.com/appydave and we'll press okay. 

249
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:06,480
What happens here is it starts regenerating the page again, and hopefully it's just 

250
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:12,690
gonna focus on that one area. So now if you want to help fund this channel, then 

251
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:14,560
check out buymeacoffee.com/appydave.

252
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,670
Now let's move on to game number five. And one of the things that ran into was this 

253
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:26,700
issue with using the term Pac Man when it drew the image. And I think we'll deal 

254
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:31,200
with that in the game generation as well. So if we head over to the requirement specs 

255
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,640
that we've got here and we can see that, can you describe the creation of the Game 

256
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:40,320
man as a short requirement? Include the game, look and feel, general requirements, 

257
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,820
game mechanics. Make sure we've got the screen controls and that they display on 

258
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:45,240
screen. 

259
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:50,610
I'm also going to get it to rename the game to GPT-Man, and we'll just press go 

260
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:55,660
We've got the game look and feel. General requirements, I think whatever it produces. 

261
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,360
We're just going to go with one more time 

262
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:03,280
so we get the retro style graphics. This is all good. The one thing that's a little 

263
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:09,250
interesting in here is that we've got the power up to allow GPT Man to eat enemies 

264
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:13,930
for a short duration. So we'll have to see whether that works. The controls are pretty 

265
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:19,300
much the same as we've seen before, so we can just take that information, go back 

266
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:24,520
home to start a new game, and then just paste the information in and press.

267
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:24,590
Okay, 

268
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:29,880
so we'll hit play and see what's going on. And the first thing to notice is it's 

269
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:34,350
very fast, so we might wanna slow it down. In fact, let's do that. 

270
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:39,400
Just see if we can go, can you slow down the speed of movement by half? See if that's 

271
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:44,260
something that'll work. It's generating it here and it's finished. We'll hit play 

272
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:49,300
and things are going a fair bit slower now. Now at the moment, the other characters 

273
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:53,380
aren't moving, so maybe we've broken something in doing this. 

274
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,740
So I've just mentioned that the opponents never come out the box and that they're 

275
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:03,190
meant to come out like in a regular game of Pac-Man. And that's kind of delayed so 

276
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:08,360
they don't all come out at the same time. So it's just finished. We'll press the 

277
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:13,750
button and one of 'em is out. So now it's starting to feel a lot like 

278
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,920
And it killed me again. 

279
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:15,900
So that's great. 

280
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:19,680
we'll just come back here and we'll right click on the GPT man. 

281
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:24,970
So we'll just change GPT, man to API, Dave, and let it rerun. 

282
00:19:25,00 --> 00:19:28,900
and now we've got the YouTube channel AppyDave as the heading here on the game.

283
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:33,310
So let's move on to the sixth game tower defense. And at the moment, they're only 

284
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:38,800
taking about two or three minutes to get each game up and running in a basic form. 

285
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:42,850
So we'll just go with another prompt that we've got. Can you describe the creation 

286
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:47,290
of a tower defense game? It's the same prompt, just with the words change. You've 

287
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:50,470
got things like cartoonish graphics coming through, 

288
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:53,720
green landscape with defined path for enemies to follow. 

289
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:58,510
towers placed along the path. Let's look at the user interface. So we've got play. 

290
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,130
We're gonna show the keyboard instructions at the beginning of the game 

291
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:08,860
and the enemies are going to come in. Waves. We've got up, down left, right? We've 

292
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:13,840
also got tower placements, so apparently they can be five that we can use and we 

293
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,180
can start and pause the game. 

294
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:20,280
So we'll head over to web sim, we'll paste it in and press go. 

295
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:25,780
Apparently initializing the code here and starting to render some sort of game. 

296
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:29,280
we've got our scores and currency and lives up here, 

297
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:30,730
hit play. 

298
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:33,160
And it's a very bright color going on at the moment. 

299
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:36,970
It's so, so far it's not working. I've just said currently I see a red line across 

300
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:37,570
the screen. 

301
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:42,130
we'll just regenerate the prompt and see if we can get this up and running. 

302
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:44,480
We got clearer instructions showing here, 

303
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:49,450
click to place a tower. Maybe that's something I didn't do before and space bar to 

304
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:50,920
start or pause the game 

305
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:52,870
and something's moving. So 

306
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:54,390
are they meant to shoot? 

307
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:58,740
it looks like it's starting to work, but we don't have any bullets coming out, 

308
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:03,120
I'm just saying no bullets are coming outta the towers. Hopefully this is enough 

309
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:03,810
to get it going. 

310
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,450
We'll try one more time 

311
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:08,660
and it's, oh, look at that. There's a bullet coming through now. 

312
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:13,570
I put in a new prompt here that says, when we get to each new level, can you reset 

313
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:15,850
the screen and draw a different path? 

314
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,710
And so here we go. 

315
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:21,940
So I've been testing a few different prompts here. And this latest one is, when we 

316
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:27,550
get to a new level, can you reset the enemies to the beginning and draw a new path? 

317
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,710
So we have a path going on here. We're on level one 

318
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:35,750
and we've just gone to level two, so we should just be able to click and create new 

319
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:36,500
items 

320
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:42,360
only. I ran outta currency, so this is interesting. There's things like currency 

321
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:44,880
that allow you to buy different towers. 

322
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:49,760
we went to level two, we had no towers, so it started again. I don't know that we'll 

323
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:54,980
get to level three. This is a little bit more finicky to get going with this particular 

324
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:55,430
game, 

325
00:21:55,460 --> 00:22:00,870
But the control of the application generation is still pretty spot on. Each time 

326
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:01,890
I make a change.

327
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,680
Moving on to the next game. We've got Wordle here and it's in the middle of just 

328
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:11,320
generating a prompt based on Wordle. And we are just going to copy it. I'm not even 

329
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,670
going to read it this time. 

330
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:13,610
We're head over to WebSim.ai 

331
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:18,670
we insert the prompt and let it run. And now let's have a look at what's going on 

332
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:25,330
here. We've got a five by six grid where players input their guesses. We've got areas 

333
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:28,870
like incorrect colors, correct letter, wrong position, 

334
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:34,770
correct letter, correct position, and it's still generating over here. The letters 

335
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:40,920
A to Z are the input letters for the current guess and enter. To submit the current 

336
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:47,190
guess, we can use the bat space key to delete the last letter from the page. So what 

337
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,900
happens if I press a, 

338
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:51,130
we press play and then 

339
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:51,730
a 

340
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,350
B. 

341
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,410
Let's do that and press enter. 

342
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:57,740
Now we've got two that are the right letters, but in the wrong location. 

343
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,990
So we'll try the word karma, 

344
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:03,590
press enter. We've got the A correct in the second position, 

345
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,640
the word naval 

346
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:08,720
made an assumption with the first two A, that there would be two A in it, but that 

347
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,620
might not be the case. And it's not, it's happy is the word. 

348
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:15,260
so looks like the word will. Game worked the first time.

349
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:20,620
So we've got this game, we can hit play on it and we'll just type in happy, I think, 

350
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:23,540
and something is correct here. Let's try 

351
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,480
dance. 

352
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:29,540
And we've got it on the second go. Now, what might be useful at this point is, can 

353
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:32,870
we just right click here and see the words that we've got available? 

354
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:37,850
So I've just put in, can you give me a list of the words that are available as a 

355
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:38,360
sheet? 

356
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,310
I did it by right clicking down near the play again. 

357
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:46,580
hopefully we're going to see a list of information behind the scenes and we have 

358
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,320
it here. So let's try another word. 

359
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:52,970
in jumbo, that was down the bottom there. And then we can go with 

360
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:54,100
dance again. 

361
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:58,130
Now it looks like it's gonna be cactus, but that's not a five letter word, so I'm 

362
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:00,590
not sure what's going on here. Let's try that. 

363
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:05,790
And it works. So there's a bug in the software, but apart from that, this is all 

364
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,890
working pretty well. 

365
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:09,720
we'd need to do a little bit of playing around with the code. I.

366
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:14,720
we're nearly through the list. We're up to Tetris here. Then we've got Donkey Kong 

367
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:18,530
and I believe there might be one other I need to do, but let's just head over to, 

368
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:23,900
can you describe the creation of the game word or, and we'll just change that to 

369
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:24,590
Tetris 

370
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:29,870
and that's going through and generating a new requirement spec for us. So the graphics 

371
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:31,190
are going to be blocks, 

372
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:38,240
Tetroaminos with different colors. We've got clear and easily distinguishable blocks, 

373
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:42,320
smooth animation for falling and moving. That's pretty cool. 

374
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:45,490
Standard sort of game elements that we've seen before. 

375
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:47,340
When a row is complete, 

376
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:52,560
filled in with all the blocks, it disappears and the player earns some points. Game 

377
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:56,640
continues until the blocks stack up to the top of the playing field. 

378
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:03,590
got the arrow keys going on, including space bar to drop a block instantly. So as 

379
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:09,740
per usual, just paste it in. Press go. So we have start of the game. Tetris Mandala 

380
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:14,450
Align. The pieces align your mind, and we've got the controls going on here at the 

381
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:16,460
moment. It's still generating the page. 

382
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:20,870
A little bit of an animation has kicked in, so we'll hit play. Whoa, that is fast. 

383
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:25,360
So I've just added, can you please slow down the blocks to a quarter of the speed 

384
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:29,560
and we'll try pressing play. And now what? Is it too slow? 

385
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:35,250
Oh, yep. Okay. It's working but it's too slow. But at least we can test it down. 

386
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:36,360
Arrow should take it 

387
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:40,570
space bar to drop it to the bottom. Okay. Move it over Space bar. 

388
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:43,820
Press the up arrow. I think what we can do 

389
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:47,390
is maybe drop that in here. We can do that. 

390
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:51,280
And the next one comes through. How are we going to test at this? 

391
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:55,420
And hopefully we will see two lines disappear with this one. 

392
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:56,720
And they did. 

393
00:25:56,730 --> 00:26:01,790
And the last bit to look at here is the score. It's currently a hundred, so as soon 

394
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:04,340
as this goes into place, it should change for us 

395
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:09,720
one 40. So the game's working straight away. There is an issue with the speed. Firstly, 

396
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:15,300
it was too fast, too slow. We can change that pretty easily. But very simple to create 

397
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,350
the game of Tetris.

398
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:21,790
So far, we've built eight games pretty quickly with WebSim.ai. From the list that 

399
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:26,590
we've got here, we've done everything except for Space Invaders, and I was going 

400
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:31,960
to work on Donkey Kong, and one of the problems I found when I looked at it was that 

401
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:36,910
it came out looking pretty poor, and I couldn't get the gameplay to work in an easy 

402
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:41,920
fashion. So I thought, why don't I change tact and go off on a new direction now, 

403
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:46,750
because I do a lot of work with AI agent frameworks, I thought, could there be a 

404
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:51,340
couple of games to make agent frameworks a lot easier to use?

405
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:56,330
So the game idea I'm thinking of is Influencer Village. As a YouTuber, I need to 

406
00:26:56,330 --> 00:27:01,520
create YouTube titles and descriptions. Sometimes a LinkedIn post or a tweet, and 

407
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,380
I use GPTs to solve the problem. 

408
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:08,790
we make a game that solves this in a more visual aspect? So I started designing some 

409
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:15,420
graphics in Dali three. We've got pixel art style here and low poly style and veto 

410
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:22,350
graphics, as well as top down 3D. So the image I think I'm gonna go with is this, 

411
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:24,480
and we'll develop a requirement spec.

412
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:26,980
Now through a series of prompts. We've got this 

413
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:31,540
Influencer Village who play a YouTube influencer navigating through a Village to 

414
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:37,900
complete necessary tasks for publishing a YouTube video. Each villager has a role 

415
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:43,960
like keyword researcher, and these are essentially going to be GPT agents that do 

416
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:48,280
individual tasks. The way I think it'll work is that I'll move around from villager 

417
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:53,740
to villager using the arrow keys, and when you encounter someone, it says, can you 

418
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:57,460
help me with a task? And sure, what task would you like help with? 

419
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:03,600
these are the inputs I need. So something like a YouTube prescription needs a transcript 

420
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,100
to write it correctly. 

421
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:09,960
Now, because I'm going to use an image as the background, I need to know the coordinates. 

422
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:14,670
So I've also asked it to put in a debug option so that I can turn it on and off to 

423
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:17,490
see what the coordinates are for each villager 

424
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:22,260
got a bunch of other general sorts of information, but the last area is also the 

425
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:26,670
list of the villagers and their roles and the sort of input that's needed. 

426
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:32,460
Let's head over to WebSim.ai, and we've pasted in our technical requirements, and 

427
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,110
we'll just start it off 

428
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:38,770
and things are starting to render right now. We've got the positions where the villages 

429
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:43,330
will be, so hopefully we'll get a little bit of a debug screen here. I 

430
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:48,390
updated the prompt with where is the debug chart and the controls, and now we have 

431
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:48,930
a debug 

432
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:54,100
chart that we can turn on and off. Unfortunately, it's also one of the arrow keys 

433
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:58,750
in this case, the right arrow key, so we could change that, but I'm not so concerned. 

434
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:03,700
I'm more interested in knowing these numbers for when we put a image behind the background. 

435
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:08,480
I'm also looking to add, when I move to a villager, I do not get an interaction and 

436
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:13,880
we'll just put the information that we had in our requirements document and see if 

437
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:15,230
this improves things. 

438
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:19,880
And now we've got this E two in interact with the villager, so if we move over, we've 

439
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:25,820
got press E to interact with the title creator, we'll press E, and we've got information 

440
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:30,860
showing up that would be a Q&A with that particular villager. So I think let's go 

441
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:33,260
and create a graphic and make it in the background.

442
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:37,380
looking through the graphics we've got here, my favorite would be this one, but I 

443
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:41,850
think the one that'll fit the shape the best might be this one. So I'm just gonna 

444
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:43,110
click download on that. 

445
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:47,870
to keep the hosting simple, I'm just gonna drag it into this product called Post 

446
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:53,390
image. And what that'll do is upload the image and make it available as public URL. 

447
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:55,760
We should be able to use that from our application. 

448
00:29:55,790 --> 00:30:00,740
here's the image and we'll go and click on the direct link and head over to here 

449
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:05,180
where I've started. Can you add the following image as a background and we'll just 

450
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:06,260
paste that in 

451
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:10,200
and click go. And we're getting a regeneration at the moment. 

452
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:17,250
there we go. So in theory, we should be able to move up to different people, interact 

453
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:21,720
with the title creator. We get the word title here. Now this image is generated in 

454
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:27,30
Dali three, so it's got a whole lot of text issues, but it's still a working idea 

455
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:31,140
transcript converter, which would be the transcription manager right here. 

456
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:35,180
Now I mentioned that the coordinates could be off. So we've got this coordinate here 

457
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:38,390
and we can press the D and notice that 

458
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:44,730
the social media manager, which is down here, is a hundred pixels to the right and 

459
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:50,790
500 pixels down. And what we might wanna do is move it to 250 pixels to the right 

460
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:56,100
or something like that. Now let's go and download this application actually and do 

461
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,990
that manually. So we'll 

462
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:01,480
click on the download button that's just here, and we've got the HTML on our computer 

463
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,220
and we'll open it in vs code. 

464
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:09,170
So I've got the game running locally from this JavaScript and HTML file that's going 

465
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:14,300
on here. So we can see the JavaScript around the positioning of the different villages 

466
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:19,370
and we can see the image that we just uploaded being read into the background. So 

467
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:24,980
all of this we can alter. So I'll just press D and we've now got our coordinates. 

468
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:30,830
And if we move around to different places, this says social media manager on the 

469
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:36,140
villager profile, but here it says transcript converter. So that's the wrong position. 

470
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:41,960
And the one over here, which I think is the social media manager, is what we pretty 

471
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,960
much want over here, maybe about that position. 

472
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:50,720
go and change this value to two 50 and this one will change to five 80. And we'll 

473
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,470
hit save 

474
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:56,330
page refreshed. The numbers should be different down here they are. Let's just move 

475
00:31:56,330 --> 00:32:01,550
to the right and this will be the social media manager, which is great. This will 

476
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:05,660
be the transcript converter. And let's test the E and see what we get. 

477
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:05,900
So 

478
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:06,590
we'll just press 

479
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:09,330
Sure I can help you with a LinkedIn post conversion.

480
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:14,370
Now where I personally see a game like this being really useful in the sort of applications 

481
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:20,370
I build is as a new interface to the GPT workflow tool that I've been developing. 

482
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:26,190
So the idea of the tool is to isolate the different GPTs that you would call into 

483
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:32,940
a sequence or a series. And last week using WebSim.ai, I developed this landing page 

484
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:39,990
where you could easily see the different phases of A GPT workflow and navigate to 

485
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:39,360
them. 

486
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:44,760
so what we could do now is take a screen like this, put it in the location that this 

487
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:50,640
one was going, and instead navigate around. And when you press E to interact, you 

488
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:55,530
can start communicating with the GPT in a more gamified approach.

489
00:32:55,560 --> 00:33:00,480
The last game that I wanna develop here would be a YouTube script automation factory. 

490
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:05,160
And it'll work in a similar fashion to the influencer village. But rather than moving 

491
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:10,590
around different areas of the village, you would just move sequentially down a production 

492
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:12,570
line to build a YouTube script. 

493
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:18,930
what I've done is developed a few images that I like, and I'm either gonna go with 

494
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:22,590
the one here, or probably this one. There are others that have been developed over 

495
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:23,100
time, 

496
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:27,320
and the way I see it working is that you would start from a type of video that you 

497
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:32,300
want to create. You'd be doing things like script writing, quality assurance, getting 

498
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:37,100
a basic fact sheet. Now this is something I do all the time. And so when I'm working 

499
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:42,530
with a GPT workflow from basic ideas, selecting an idea, building a fact sheet about 

500
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:48,920
a video, I want to do video ideas. And I have the ability to navigate to each of 

501
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:55,130
these different ideas. And I use this for creating actual videos on a faceless channel 

502
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:57,710
that I'm developing now. The channel's only a month old. 

503
00:33:57,730 --> 00:34:03,720
so started off with this Ideogram video, but basically every script that you've got 

504
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:09,750
here has been generated using a simple GPT workflow. And funnily enough, one of my 

505
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:16,290
first videos took off 700 views a couple of days ago. So what I'd like to do is develop 

506
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:21,270
a requirement spec. And now that I look at it, I think this is the image we'll use 

507
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:27,570
as a background, and we'll see if we can automate or gamify the creation of YouTube 

508
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:28,200
scripts.

509
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:33,240
we'll start off by downloading an image. Now this is the image I like the most, but 

510
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:37,800
from a straight line perspective, which will be easy for the coordinates, we'll work 

511
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:42,810
with this one instead. So we'll just click download within DALE-3 here. 

512
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:47,990
I've headed over to post image and I've uploaded the image we've got and we're just 

513
00:34:48,40 --> 00:34:49,190
copying the URL. 

514
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:53,220
Here's the requirements document for the YouTube Automation Factory. 

515
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:58,100
we have the, in the YouTube automation factory, your character is navigating through 

516
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,380
an assembly line, completing tasks, 

517
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:03,730
necessary for creating YouTube videos. 

518
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:06,960
then we've got a list of stations within the factory. Now, they're not the order 

519
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:12,390
I do them, but this is just the idea of creating the game. From there, we've also 

520
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:17,190
got the image and we'll make sure that we've got the proper URL when we include it 

521
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,690
in the requirement spec. 

522
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:24,930
We got the debugged feature that we did before we, so that we can align the stations 

523
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:26,100
with the coordinates. 

524
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:31,120
this time I'm just keeping the characters movement to left and right keys. We down 

525
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,970
the bottom, we've also got a list of stations that we can work with. 

526
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:38,140
head over to WebSim.ai, we can just take all the information we've got, 

527
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,940
We've got it generating all the HTML and CSS behind the scenes. 

528
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,170
we've got the background has kicked in 

529
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:49,890
and we've got the stations. Now, obviously they would need to go down in this angular 

530
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:50,520
format, 

531
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:55,600
and the D for the debug is working so we can see all the 

532
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:58,430
coordinates. So they look a little odd. I don't know, 

533
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:02,720
Maybe it's on just one vertical access. And so these are just the positions left 

534
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:07,850
and right. So we're probably gonna need to put in a Y and an X coordinate. Now let's 

535
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:10,100
just see if the arrows are working 

536
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:10,880
and it looks like 

537
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:16,360
And next, can I help you with a fact sheet? And then there's sort of secondary question 

538
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,230
coming up. So I need the expanded fact sheet from which to work on. 

539
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:24,510
So I'm just gonna bookmark this last one. And all the games that I've been building 

540
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:28,680
the, I got the bookmarks in the YouTube description below. 

541
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:31,600
we'll do right now is just download this to the.

542
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:36,180
So here's A-H-T-M-L that we've got for the page that you're looking at and everything 

543
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:40,920
works okay, but there are two problems. One is that it's only got a position coordinate, 

544
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:46,500
so it doesn't have a Y access that we can configure. And the updating of the character 

545
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:52,830
position also does not actually follow the elements or the stations on screen. 

546
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:57,480
is added? Two prompts. Can you modify it so that the Y coordinate is configurable? 

547
00:36:57,490 --> 00:37:00,490
I also want the person to move to the next station. 

548
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:02,990
let's have a look at the code comparison. 

549
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:06,690
here we have the old on the left and the right is the new. And you can see that the 

550
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:09,330
coordinates are fixed on the old version. 

551
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:13,740
And in the JavaScript configuration, we now have an external Y coordinate rather 

552
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:19,470
than position. Also, the coordinates are being used when calculating locations. So 

553
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:20,610
let's see how this looks.

554
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:25,440
So here's our YouTube automation factory, and we've got in the top right hand corner, 

555
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:30,480
the task completed zero seven. If we press the D for debug, we should be able to 

556
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:35,850
see the coordinates for the different stations in the factory. And if we use the 

557
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:40,620
right keyboard, we should be able move forward and see, hello. You can help me with 

558
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:46,260
determining the video type and we just keep moving through the different tasks all 

559
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:46,470
the way to 

560
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:50,810
The best thing about this workflow is like most of 'em, it takes about 10 minutes 

561
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:53,240
to recreate this particular application.

562
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:59,330
So that was building 10 games with WebSim.ai. Eight of them were classics. Two of 

563
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:04,190
them were the sorts of games or workflows that I might want in my GPT workflow engine. 

564
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:09,740
So if you are interested in ChatGPT or Prompt Engineering or different AI tools, 

565
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:14,330
then please I can subscribe or leave a comment down below and the video over here 

566

on the side 

567
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:21,460
point you to the WebSim.ai demonstration that I did, building a component for A GPT 

568
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:21,850
workflow.
