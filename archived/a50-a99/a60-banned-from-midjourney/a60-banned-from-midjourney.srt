00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,940
This video is for anyone that's been banned from mid-journey or doesn't want to get banned

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:09,980
from mid-journey and at the end of the video I'll point you to 16 great alternatives.

3
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,040
Hi, I'm AppyDave and I'm going to share what happened.

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:20,500
The ban that I got, the $300 that I lost, what I believe is a misdiagnosis and the frustration

5
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,400
that I had dealing with mid-journey support.

6
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:29,100
And then after that I'm going to show you 16 beautiful alternatives to mid-journey.

7
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:34,900
I've been using mid-journey since March last year and I've created thousands of images

8
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:38,140
that I've used a lot within my YouTube videos.

9
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:44,320
But last year I did end up switching a fair bit over to Dali 3 mainly because I found

10
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:51,680
it easier to work with within ChatGPT and I'd already done a video showcasing 200 image

11
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,900
comparisons between the two different products across 50 prompts.

12
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:02,420
And in my opinion, Dali 3, while not as good as mid-journey, was a worthy contender.

13
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,340
Last month I was talking at a tech summit and I needed some pretty good images for the

14
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:12,060
presentation I was doing so I ended up reactivating my mid-journey account.

15
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,960
Now one week later I found myself having to upgrade because I'd used up all the credits

16
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,720
that I had there and I ended up spending $288.

17
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:26,320
But it was great because the images I was able to generate for the tech summit presentation

18
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,700
were just wonderful.

19
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:33,800
Now two weeks ago I moved to countries, I came over to Thailand and not long after arriving

20
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:39,180
I started getting this particular error creation failed on my mid-journey account.

21
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:45,680
I headed over to Discord and saw this error that's saying accessing our services via

22
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:50,620
automation, scripting or third party tools created a ban.

23
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:55,760
Now I started doing a bit of research to figure out what was going on because I hadn't done

24
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:00,880
any automation or third party scripting and people had come up with these issues banned

25
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,280
due to billing not matching the home address okay, not my situation.

26
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,120
Someone has talked about losing a $60 subscription and not being refunded.

27
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:17,580
My situation is $288 because I spent it for a full year and I haven't been refunded either.

28
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:24,140
Then we saw other sorts of issues with banning going on and then this next one gave me a

29
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,340
little bit of a clue to what might be the issue.

30
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:30,360
This includes IP and email bans from Discord.

31
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:36,220
I headed over to an email and I wrote I can't sign into mid-journey I've checked the images

32
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:40,320
there's nothing that meets the fraud or the other issues that they listed.

33
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:46,580
I'm an influencer and basically all the images that I do for YouTube and that's important

34
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:52,780
to understand because you can't do bad quality images on YouTube and get away with it.

35
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:59,380
And what happened was I got this reply straight away from them saying severe repeated violations

36
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:06,660
of terms and services, use of automation, scripting, APIs, engaging in reselling services.

37
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,760
So none of this stuff was going on for me.

38
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,040
And then we had this one.

39
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:15,940
You should have received notifications in Discord informing you of this that they would

40
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:20,500
have appeared that you've interacted with a bot and copies should have been sent to you.

41
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:25,080
Now I've not received a direct message regarding that so I'm not sure what's going on.

42
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:30,160
The other thing that they've stated here is as per the terms and conditions refunds are

43
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,420
not issued on banned accounts.

44
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,160
So I thought okay where do I go now?

45
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:40,700
So as I reviewed the forums again it got me thinking about this IP address ban and the

46
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:46,120
reason it got me thinking about it is that a year and a half ago I came to Chiang Mai for six months

47
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,620
and while I was here I signed up to an American e-commerce platform.

48
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:55,520
About two weeks later they sent me an email saying that I've been banned and that I've

49
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,340
been banned for life.

50
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:02,260
I could not get an account again and I ended up in that particular situation sending details

51
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:05,120
of my passport and my bank account details.

52
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:10,700
And then funnily enough four months later when I was back in Australia I got a reversal.

53
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,740
So that was a misdiagnosis going on.

54
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:21,420
Now two weeks ago I found myself moving again back to Chiang Mai and I was going via the Philippines.

55
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:28,200
So the three places that I find myself in are Australia where I'm either in Sydney or Brisbane.

56
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:32,160
I find myself in Philippines and I find myself in Thailand.

57
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:37,960
I ended up sending a reply email to mid-journey stating that I hadn't violated any terms or

58
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:43,620
conditions that I was aware of and that I travel and that means that I open on different

59
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:49,520
computers with different IPs my mid-journey account and all they did was reply stating

60
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,500
we can't provide you with any additional information about your ban.

61
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,080
Banned users are not eligible for a refund.

62
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:02,640
So to be honest I was a bit gutted by all of that and quite angry that I'd spent money

63
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:08,340
only about three weeks earlier and it was all lost and they won't even do the courtesy of

64
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,040
communicating with me about it.

65
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,620
Rather than get caught up in the resentment of dealing with mid-journey support what I

66
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,900
thought is it's time for a new relationship.

67
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:23,180
Now here are 16 great alternatives to mid-journey and if you've got any questions about them then

68
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:28,080
please drop a comment down below otherwise like and subscribe because the next video

69
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,480
I'm going to go into detail on these 16 image generators and how they compare

70
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,540
to the same prompt in mid-journey.
