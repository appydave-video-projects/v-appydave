1
00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:05,330
In this video, I'm testing how to do better prompts by using anthropics prompt generation 

2
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:05,420
tool.

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:11,410
Back in May. Anthropic released a prompt generation tool within their console, and 

4
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:15,760
they've got this blog post that says, you can now generate production ready prompt 

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:21,940
templates using Anthropic console and using techniques such as chain of thought reasoning. 

6
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:26,470
Now, if you head over to their documentation, they basically say sometimes the hardest 

7
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:32,320
part of using AI model is figuring how to prompt it effectively to help, we've created 

8
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,830
a prompt generation tool, and that's what we're going to explore today.

9
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:40,840
So I've been building a GPT workflow engine, and this morning I was releasing a video 

10
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:46,360
and realized I didn't have the prompts prepared for creating a tweet or doing a LinkedIn 

11
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:50,380
post. These are the prompts that we're going to try and develop. Basically, they 

12
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:54,940
would take some inputs and the prompt would go in here. So how do we improve that 

13
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:55,900
particular prompt? 

14
00:00:55,930 --> 00:01:01,930
Now, in the past I've used custom GPT to turn transcripts from my videos into LinkedIn 

15
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:07,750
posts and also to convert 'em into tweets. But today we're gonna do it a lot simpler 

16
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:08,710
to get started.

17
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:13,430
I've come over to consult dot Anthropic dot com and we've got this ability to write 

18
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:17,720
some prompts and interact with a model. There's also stuff around a system prompt, 

19
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,610
and there's this little button here that says, generate prompt and it'll make a better 

20
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:27,560
prompt for you, hopefully. So what we're gonna do is just click on that and I'm just 

21
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:32,930
gonna use a really simple statement, create tweets for YouTube videos, and we'll 

22
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:37,340
generate the prompt and we'll see what it comes up with. So it's got a bunch of information 

23
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:42,530
coming through. Looks like some variables. It put in some guidelines, and it looks 

24
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:45,230
like it's going to produce three different tweets. 

25
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:50,230
So the generated prompt starts with, you are tasked with creating engaging tweets 

26
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:56,170
to promote YouTube videos. Your goal is to craft tweets that grab attention, convey 

27
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:00,910
essence of the video, and encourage users to click and watch. Sounds great. We've 

28
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:05,170
got a title, which makes sense. We've got a description, we've got a duration, 

29
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,710
Let's read the guidelines a bit. 

30
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:12,550
tweets should be concise. 280 characters. Yes. Main point and hook in the video. 

31
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,170
Couple of hashtags. 

32
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:20,130
it's got this mention the video duration if the selling point, eg. Quick five minute 

33
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:20,580
guide 

34
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:24,540
that sounds interesting. It's like something that might happen if it's useful. 

35
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,870
then we've got the structure attention grabbing. We've got calls to action and we've 

36
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:33,490
got the video link. So it's given a couple of examples. It's brilliant. Actually, 

37
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:35,740
please create three different tweets. 

38
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,370
this is good. We've got three examples and they're going into locations called Tweet 

39
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,320
one, two, and three. 

40
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,130
this is a pretty good start. 

41
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,560
this was the video I was going to do a tweet about. 

42
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:51,560
it's nine days old. I didn't do a tweet at the time, but I do have a title. We do 

43
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,460
have a description. 

44
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,990
So I've just bought up the workflow tool, which is around creating a tweet at the 

45
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:56,320
moment. 

46
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:59,480
the prompt that we want to do would go into here, but here are the variables that 

47
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:04,130
we've got, which is a title that was in the prompt we were looking at. We got a video 

48
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:08,640
link. We got keywords, which wasn't in the prompt we were just looking at, and we 

49
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:08,870
got the 

50
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:14,820
So we're in Anthropic console with the prompt that we need. I've made one modification, 

51
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:20,190
so that used to say video duration, and I've also removed point number six that talked 

52
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:25,110
about that. Now, one of the things I noticed, there's nowhere for the URL though 

53
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:29,580
there are those square brackets down here saying video link, and that's in a few 

54
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,900
places. So let's see what happens when we generate this. So we should be able to 

55
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,500
edit it. 

56
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:38,900
And I've gone and filled in the title, the description, and the keyword from the 

57
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:43,310
video. I haven't filled in the URL, but we'll run it and we'll see what we get. 

58
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:48,910
So we've got these tweet one, two, and three. Let's test this text. That's a little 

59
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:51,370
bit easier to read so we can see what the first, 

60
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,810
tweet will be, the second and the third. 

61
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:56,190
I'm just gonna paste in video link. 

62
00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:01,700
We can click here to configure, paste it in, and let's see if that's all we need 

63
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,800
to do to add the video link. 

64
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:08,540
So that didn't work, but we could try one other thing and maybe change it so that 

65
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,680
it's got these input 

66
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:15,210
Now I was struggling for a little bit to get the URL in here. I kept seeing square 

67
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:18,420
brackets, video link, and I wasn't sure what was going on. 

68
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:23,520
then I noticed at the bottom it actually says to do that, remember to use video link 

69
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,410
as a placeholder for the actual URL, which might be what you want. It's not what 

70
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:31,290
I wanted. So I've just replaced it with this. 

71
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,100
we'll just rerun the prompt again. 

72
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:34,850
we should get three tweets 

73
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:39,870
we've got one here. We don't have one here. Interesting. So we'll just undo. 

74
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:44,190
So I'm also gonna change this little structure that it's got there and just say, 

75
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:48,240
remember to add it to the tweet and we'll see if all three of them come up with video 

76
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,890
links this time. So the first one does the second and the third. 

77
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:57,640
one of the problems that I just noticed in having it generate a prompt for me is 

78
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,630
that unless I go in, 

79
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:03,260
and pick it apart, I might Miss Little things. This doesn't usually happen when I'm 

80
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,360
creating prompts myself, 

81
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,650
So I've come into a tech editor and put the prompt that Anthropics created over on 

82
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:17,250
the left and over on the right I've got part of the prompt from my custom GPT. And 

83
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:22,170
we can see here us specialized in creating tweets for YouTube videos, and we've got 

84
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:27,390
different information. One of them is the 280 character limit that we've got going 

85
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:27,960
on here. 

86
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:33,470
I usually use the following three variables, the summary from the video, the video 

87
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,780
keywords, and the video URL. 

88
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:38,520
what I thought I'd do is just copy this information 

89
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:43,320
I've come in to generate a new prompt and I'm just gonna paste everything that we 

90
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,240
had from our old prompt. 

91
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:50,650
what I'm hoping is that because I spend a bit of time figuring out what I wanted, 

92
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:55,690
and it generally works the way I do want it to work, let's see if we can improve 

93
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:55,780
it. 

94
00:05:55,790 --> 00:06:00,320
it's come up with a number of examples, which is great. We've got the summary, the 

95
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:04,850
keywords, and the URL, so this looks like it might be a good way to start. 

96
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:09,980
I'm happy with what it's done. One of the things it's done here is added in a couple 

97
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:14,780
of keywords, which is something you'd want to do. There weren't any keywords coming 

98
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:18,800
through on this, which is interesting. Look, both techniques are 

99
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:24,430
fairly powerful. Obviously with this one, this was such a simple start. It was just 

100
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:30,250
create tweets for a YouTube video and it got a big prompt going straight away. The 

101
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:34,930
second one, it was more in keeping with what I wanted originally because I'd spent 

102
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,940
a bit of time building a starter prompt.

103
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:43,710
So I'm going to try this new prompt in my workflow tool. So I've taken everything 

104
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:48,540
that we just generated. I've just modified the variables a little bit right here. 

105
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:52,140
And we've got a workflow engine here with the title, the link, the keywords, and 

106
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:57,330
the summary, and we'll just paste everything in. And these insertion points, if I 

107
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:59,190
show the values, should be 

108
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:03,870
showing up. So there's a summary going on. That looks good. We've got the keywords, 

109
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:08,250
we'll just close that down. Press copy, it's now in the clipboard. We'll head over 

110
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:14,130
to GPT and just paste it in and see if it can produce a good looking, 

111
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,710
tweet as well. And it looks pretty good. I probably wanna get rid of these, 

112
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:22,880
notation that's from Anthropic, but the actual tweet, 

113
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:28,630
the keywords also make a lot of sense. The good thing also, we've using an external 

114
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:34,780
tool rather than the Anthropic one is that you could go and use other sorts of models 

115
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:37,750
as you see fit for different steps in the workflow.

116
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:43,400
So with the tweet text available, I'm just going to create a tweet. I'll just drag 

117
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:49,130
in an image here and we'll paste it in and hopefully it's not too big. It looks good, 

118
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:54,530
and we can post it and we should test it, see whether the URL is working. So we'll 

119
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:59,960
just click on that. I recently added by me a copy looks and it looks like we've got 

120
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,650
a video coming through. Let's move on and just do the LinkedIn post as well 

121
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:08,750
let's test the simple one First. You create LinkedIn posts based on a YouTube script. 

122
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:14,690
Something's coming through, it's taking a YouTube script, and then there's a bunch 

123
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:18,770
of points that it needs to do. We're just going to press continue on that, and then 

124
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:21,200
I think we can just click on the YouTube script, 

125
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:25,270
come over to the YouTube script, paste it in, and we'll run it and we'll see what 

126
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,530
we get for a LinkedIn post. 

127
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:32,150
And it's created two useful things. So it's got, its thinking how it's approaching 

128
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:37,130
it, it's figured out generally the topic. And it's only done that from the abridgement. 

129
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:43,190
I didn't give the title. And we've got some key points listed here and relevant keywords 

130
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:47,600
from there. It's written a short but useful, 

131
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:53,750
post. There's no link to the YouTube video in there, but you could start with this. 

132
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,760
What we'll do is we'll update it 

133
00:08:55,790 --> 00:09:01,230
by using the YouTube transformer that I've got over here so we can edit it, go into 

134
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,880
configure, and we'll just, 

135
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:04,460
copy whatever's going on. Here 

136
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:08,990
we are now on a new prompt. We'll say generate prompt and the information that's 

137
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:14,690
from the GPT with a little bit of a modification is just sitting here. And all the 

138
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:19,730
variables that I need are included or the, the variables I like to include for my 

139
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,170
LinkedIn post, whether they're really needed. It could be debatable, but we've got 

140
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:27,590
something coming through here and it's guidelines. 

141
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:31,370
I think we're just ultimately going to work with something very similar to this. 

142
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,900
Let's press continue.

143
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:38,380
So I've got my workflow tool. I'm just gonna be copying values from one tool to the 

144
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:43,150
other and we'll test out how this all works. There's everything filled in. We'll 

145
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,260
press run on that. 

146
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:45,210
And we've got, 

147
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:50,270
are you a small content creator looking to monetize, discover, game changing platform 

148
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:54,940
that's helping creators earn from day one? We've got a bunch of things. We've got 

149
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:55,480
some 

150
00:09:55,490 --> 00:10:00,960
steps that I did in the video. We've got a link not necessarily quite in the format 

151
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,260
I want, but it's in the location I want. We've got some, 

152
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:06,150
keywords. I think 

153
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,120
that we will take this, we're gonna look at one other thing before we do, but I'm 

154
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:14,410
just gonna take this information straight over to LinkedIn. The other thing it's 

155
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:19,630
done is give us us a bit of an explanation around what's going on. 

156
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:21,510
it can be good to read through this as well. 

157
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:25,450
I've just gone over to LinkedIn. I'm just gonna drag in a thumbnail and we'll just 

158
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:31,990
paste in everything we've got and it's looking pretty good. There is an issue here 

159
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:34,960
with the link, I believe, and we'll press post 

160
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:35,660
and 

161
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:38,980
probably I would normally read this, but we'll go with that. 

162
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:45,830
there's the first version of the LinkedIn post. Let's check that the URL is working. 

163
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,180
It looks like it's working 

164
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:52,410
let's just do one more test. I've got all the information from our prompt here. I've 

165
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:57,870
got some placeholders, and we'll just copy the information, come over to the prompt 

166
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:58,230
area. 

167
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:03,460
that it loads up the insertion points from the data that we've got here. We can just 

168
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,150
press the copy button, 

169
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:11,110
bring up a GPT and paste it in, and we will publish both LinkedIn articles if this 

170
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:15,400
one looks okay, just so that we can see them side by side in LinkedIn. 

171
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:19,880
So we've come to LinkedIn, we'll just post in another image like we did before. 

172
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:23,710
I've given a just a little bit of padding between lines that didn't come through 

173
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:29,890
correctly and there is no URL, but we've got that in place now. We'll press post 

174
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:32,980
and what we can now do is look at these side by side. 

175
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:37,880
So here's the first LinkedIn post that we did, and the second one is going on here. 

176
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:43,520
And ultimately they're both gonna be okay, whatever we've got. Usually I'll do a 

177
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,590
little bit of human editing anyway, 

178
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:50,730
and this just allows me to get a little bit more social proof out there in the form 

179
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:55,410
of posts and do 'em quickly just using the transcriptions that we started off with 

180
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:55,920
in the video.

181
00:11:55,930 --> 00:12:00,850
Anthropics Prompt Generator is really powerful. I'm going to use it a lot in the 

182
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:05,260
future. If you've got any questions, then drop a comment down below. Otherwise like 

183
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:10,210
and subscribe because the videos that I do will either be on prompt engineering or 

184
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:15,460
as I build out this GPT workflow engine. You can see the progress as I go. With that, 

185
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,470
I'm AppyDave. See you in the next video.
