1
00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:04,980
 just watched this video Genius shortcut to 4,000 watch hours on YouTube, and I thought, 

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:11,250
could I take the ideas that he's talking about here and run them through a GPT automation 

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:18,210
of sorts and get to 4,000 watch hours myself? Now he talks about the idea of titles 

4
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:22,230
and hooks and thumbnails being good, but there's something else that you can do. 

5
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:27,530
And he encapsulated all the information in this video. So I thought, can I take that 

6
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:34,200
information, reverse engineer it into a chat GPT workflow and execute it myself on 

7
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,640
any topic I like. Hi, I'm AppyDave, and we're going to reverse engineer this three 

8
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,350
step formula from the video. Now, if you've been paying attention to this series, 

9
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:48,600
you know that I'm in the middle of creating some software for automating the different 

10
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:54,900
GPT workflows that I do. And often I start off from this architecture where I design 

11
00:00:54,900 --> 00:01:00,630
them and we have this concept of a objective and an idea that we would like to automate 

12
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:01,710
with GPT. 

13
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:06,120
the simple workflow here is that I can list the steps, organize some, come up with 

14
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:11,430
some ideas. So vidIQ have already come up with a formula for doing the hooks or the 

15
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:17,190
bridge that transitions a video from one video into the next video. And I would love 

16
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:22,170
to understand that formula so that when I'm recording a video, I can transition people 

17
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:26,670
into the next video and myself. Now to get started, what we need to do is get everything 

18
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:31,830
that was set in this video, and under every video there's a description and if we 

19
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:35,340
click on there and expand it, what we should be able to come down and find is the 

20
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:40,110
show transcript button. So we'll click on that and now every word that was said and 

21
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:43,140
the time it was said is showing over here on the right. 

22
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,500
what we'll do is we'll just click on this little button and we'll toggle off the 

23
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,230
timestamps because they're not that relevant for us. 

24
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:53,280
then we'll go to the very top and dragged to the bottom. And I've just copied it 

25
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,540
into the clip. I've come over to the agent workflow builder, and in particular I've 

26
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:01,590
gone to a workflow I use whenever I'm launching a video because it's gonna be really 

27
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:06,570
useful with the transcript. So when I'm preparing a video, I'm trying to build things 

28
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:11,100
like YouTube descriptions, thumbnails, titles, et cetera. And one of the areas I 

29
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:16,410
can deal with is a bridging the transcript. This is about shortening it down to. 

30
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,910
So I'm just gonna go over to this transcript field and put it through this prompt. 

31
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:26,130
So we just click on copy here, bring up a GPT, and we're just gonna paste everything 

32
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:32,730
in. So what we're looking at right now is the transcript from the vidIQ video merged 

33
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:38,640
in with an instruction to give us just the raw information in detail. So it's all 

34
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,290
coming through right here. We're already at the first benefit of this process alone. 

35
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:47,790
So we've taken a five minute video and we've boiled it down into the key components 

36
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:52,290
that matter to me, and I can read it in about 30 seconds. So in it he talks about 

37
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:57,710
the bridge, a curiosity hook, and the promise of transformation. This is all about 

38
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:03,100
from one video to the next video in the series. Now, a problem when I look at this 

39
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:08,200
is that I've watched the video and there may be a couple of details that are missing 

40
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,780
from this abridgement. So let's just take this one step further. 

41
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,700
I've copied that response and I'm just gonna move on to the next step that I use 

42
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,390
myself. 

43
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,590
that's taking the original transcript from vidIQ, the abridgement that we've just 

44
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:23,280
created and doing a quality assurance check on. 

45
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:27,100
I'll pop up the prompt or the chat window we've been working on. I'll just paste 

46
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:31,480
this in and if there's anything in the original transcript that I don't have in my 

47
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:36,310
abridgement, we're going to at least have it clarified, whether we need to do anything 

48
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:40,480
with it is up to us. So when we look at the differences between the transcript and 

49
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,250
the abridgement, the first one, a mission of the game changing strategy is really 

50
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:50,290
only his own emotional hook to keep us engaged in the video. So this is not adding 

51
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:55,400
value to the process, but when I looked through the next three, the missing emotional 

52
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:00,710
appeal details on viewer engagement and repetition for emphasis, especially the fact 

53
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:05,180
that it gave some examples, I thought these would be interesting. Now they're not 

54
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,980
part of the main process. There were three points to the main process, but they're 

55
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:14,650
certainly guidelines or points of interest that would be really useful for any GPT 

56
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:19,180
or prompt that you are writing to know about. So I think we want to include those 

57
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:23,770
bits of information. Now, as I moved through and I looked at the other four going 

58
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:28,150
on here, I thought they're great, but they don't really add any value to the process. 

59
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:32,480
Again, they're more about creating engagement for the person watching the video. 

60
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:37,340
So I've just taken that information and I've put in a prompt that says, can you ensure 

61
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:40,90
the abridgement includes information on? 

62
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:45,290
I've said, can you include three pieces of extra information, mostly guidelines and 

63
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:48,560
points of interest and the original abridgement? 

64
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,100
hopefully what we're gonna get is a three point abridgement plus some extra guidelines. 

65
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,750
And this is gonna be really useful to us as we build out our workflow. 

66
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:02,340
it's done a great job. It's kept the three sections, it's just given a little bit 

67
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:08,640
more depth and nuance to the information. So with this, we can go and copy all of 

68
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:14,460
that information 'cause this is going to be seed information into our new GPT workflow. 

69
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:17,640
Now I've just brought us over to the agent workflow architect, and this is where 

70
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:22,650
I'm building the different workflows in the GPT builder. We'll click on the workflow 

71
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:28,200
objective. What we need is a simple idea and a goal. Now, because we already had 

72
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,520
a lot of rich context from what we've been doing so far, I've just asked for the 

73
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:38,640
idea. So we'll paste that in here and we'll create a goal past it in here, press 

74
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:44,820
copy. I think we will start a new chat GPT window and paste the information in. What 

75
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:49,620
we're looking for is just an objective for this agent workflow. 

76
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:54,100
So that looks very clean to me. We'll copy it and we'll just to the next step in 

77
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,760
the workflow, which is getting a list of steps that we might want to do, and we'll 

78
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:03,340
press copy on that and paste it all in and see what list of steps it thinks we need 

79
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:08,200
to do to get this. What we've got here is a list of seven steps that seem to make 

80
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:13,660
sense when you are doing a bridge from one video to another. Now, in the workflow 

81
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:17,860
tool, when it's fully operational, you will click this little button for start, and 

82
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:23,470
those steps that we just saw will show up in the steps list attribute, and I'm going 

83
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:29,560
to have capabilities to modify, merge, delete, or add to that. But for now, what 

84
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,700
we'll do is head back to the GPT that we've got, and I've just put in a little prompt 

85
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:39,460
to say merge the first two steps because they are one, I like the next three. I want 

86
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:44,650
to drop this one here and I just wanna rename this one to quality assurance. So we'll 

87
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:49,480
just run that and we'll get a new list of steps and we'll just move on to the next 

88
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:55,930
workflow, which takes a step list. The idea is to convert it into a hierarchy. So 

89
00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:00,610
we can click on copy here, we'll paste it in and we'll let it run through. I only 

90
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:06,160
want one phase called YouTube outro bridge. In this case, it's not a complex enough 

91
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,410
workflow to need multiple phases just with one step in each of them. So we'll do 

92
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:16,150
it this way and we're gonna copy this information in. Move on to the next step. This 

93
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:21,160
is where we're going to come up with some workflow name ideas, like what are we going 

94
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,570
to call it? Press copy and paste the information in, and hopefully we're going to 

95
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:29,740
get some good names that we can call the workflow by. I've liked the first one, I've 

96
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:34,690
just tapped on the word YouTube to the beginning of it, but now I think we can build 

97
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:38,800
a specification, and this is how all the steps will fit together and the sorts of 

98
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,910
information we need to collect along the way. We'll just press copy and we'll just 

99
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:48,310
paste the information in. We have our workflow specification with it's the phase 

100
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:53,950
we're in is the YouTube outro bridge. There are three steps involved with descriptions, 

101
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,330
and we've got some inputs. Obviously the video content, what I'm going to call the 

102
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:03,160
transcript or the abridgement is going to come through and it's gonna pull out key 

103
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:07,360
themes using various bits of information we'll collect along the way. We'll get the 

104
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:13,690
final outro. Now, everything we collected for the YouTube outro booster is now visualized 

105
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:19,660
as a workflow with content analysis, writing an outro script and just checking the 

106
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:24,550
script and putting some cue points. So if I just want to talk about it without narrating, 

107
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:28,990
I can do that. Now, I did skip a little section because it won't be needed in the 

108
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:34,660
final product, but if you were interested in how it created an automation script 

109
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:39,460
to automatically create the particular pages we're seeing with areas for the content 

110
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:44,710
analysis, writing the outro script and the cue points, then you can look at the last 

111
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:49,900
video, which talked about this file structure. Let's test this out by actually creating 

112
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:54,860
an outro. The irony is that the outro that we are creating is for the last video 

113
00:08:55,160 --> 00:09:00,590
to point to this video. So the next video goal will be this workflow will help you 

114
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:05,150
get 4,000 watch hours. Quickly, the transcript to the last video, which is going 

115
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:09,800
to have this outro, is here. So we'll copy paste it straight in here, and we'll click 

116
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:14,780
copy. So I've run that prompt and down the bottom I've got the key themes from the 

117
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:19,760
video that I want the outro on, and they're all listed here. There's information 

118
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,140
about the bridge, the curate hook, and the transformation promise. Just copy the 

119
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:29,600
information, go back to our application and paste in the content analysis with the 

120
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:34,940
next video, copy this, and we'll see what sort of outro script we'll get. And here 

121
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:39,620
we have it. Now, if you've seen how domain specific languages can streamline your 

122
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:43,670
YouTube launch strategy, imagine taking that to the next level. What if you could 

123
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:49,100
achieve 4,000 watch hours faster than ever? So this is a pretty good outro script. 

124
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:53,450
If I don't like that, I might be able to do a refresh and it better one might come 

125
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:53,870
together. 

126
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:58,460
 that you've learned how to create seamless transitions between your videos using 

127
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:03,320
agent workflows, let's take it a step further. What if your thumbnails could capture 

128
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:08,30
the same level of precision and engagement? In the next video, I'll take you through 

129
00:10:08,30 --> 00:10:13,280
an agent driven workflow for designing thumbnails. The idea being that you can create 

130
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:18,770
compelling visuals, emotion capturing text, and a layout and system that'll get people 

131
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:22,910
clicking on those thumbnails and watching more of your videos. So stay tuned for 

132
