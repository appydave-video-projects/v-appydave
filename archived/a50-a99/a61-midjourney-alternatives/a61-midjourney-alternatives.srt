1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,620
Are you looking for a great alternative to mid-journey? In this video I go

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,960
through 16 competitors and what I'll be doing is trialling three different

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,000
prompts, three different reference images and see how it looks in all 16

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,300
products. And we're going to use three images that I've used in the past. I've

5
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:23,740
created these in mid-journey. I've used them in my videos and with each of them

6
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:29,700
we're going to run them through the 16 AI art generators. We are going to need a

7
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:34,580
prompt. So what I thought I'd do is take each of the individual images and we'll

8
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:39,040
drag them straight into DALE-3. Once they're in DALE-3 we can actually

9
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,300
ask DALE-3 to tell us what the image is about. But I'll give it a little bit

10
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:48,460
extra context by giving it the original mid-journey prompt as well. And then

11
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:53,340
when we run it through DALE-3 we get a prompt like this. So in this particular

12
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:58,080
case it's create an animated illustration of a smiling 30 year old

13
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,800
blond man with eyeglasses. And then a bit later on it says the style should be

14
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,780
similar to modern animated illustrations with a clean and simple design. And what

15
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:12,040
we'll do is we'll take that prompt and the reference image and we're just going

16
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:17,220
to run it through all 16 AI art generators. So the first two we'll look

17
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:23,300
at is Night Cafe and Idiogram. Now Night Cafe has a nice clean user interface

18
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:27,860
where you can select different styles. Whereas Idiogram is really good at

19
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:33,660
doing symbolic art and idiograms. We've got two images here they're looking

20
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:41,520
pretty clean to me. Next we'll look at Open Art and Designs AI. So Open Art has

21
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,360
the ability to use multiple models. I think it has something like a hundred

22
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,740
different models that you can use. Designs AI can be used for images but it can

23
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:56,660
also be used for logos and videos as well. Next to our Blue Willow which is by

24
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,980
Linewire and a Dove Firefly. They're both producing really great images we would

25
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:07,360
expect that from a Dove but this Blue Willow product is also pretty good. I

26
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,760
better mention too that we have a Dove Firefly it's like canvas so you have the

27
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,780
ability to do a lot of other design tooling with that product. And that then

28
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:21,760
brings us on to Photor and Crayon. And Photor is an interesting one because

29
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:27,620
it's a graphics editing software and their implementation of generative art is

30
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:32,580
pretty good I think. Then we've got Crayon which I had a lot of trouble trying to

31
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:37,580
get good images from it. So this is the first time we've come across an AI art

32
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:41,820
generator that wouldn't compare to mid-journey but everything else has been

33
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:48,940
pretty good so far. Next we have Dream Studio and Imagine. And Dream Studio has

34
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:53,020
the ability to have moddable models as well that you can select from and

35
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:58,420
Imagine Art is a detailed illustration tool. Both of these are producing great

36
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:04,420
images. Next we're looking at Playground and Hotpot. Now Playground has advanced

37
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:10,660
editing features while Hotpot also has some editing capabilities. One of the

38
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:15,220
things I noticed with this particular image is that to me it didn't feel like

39
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:19,620
the illustration style that was described in the prompt but they're still

40
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:25,080
great images. The next two to look at is Lexico and Microsoft Copilot. And

41
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,860
Lexico in the past has been an AI art search engine. It's a great place to

42
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:34,380
get inspiration but they also have creation tools and we've used them here

43
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:38,280
and this is a tool I do want to deep dive into and there will be a video on

44
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:45,160
that. As for Microsoft Copilot it's essentially DALE-3. So whatever you're

45
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,720
looking for as well. The last two in the list are Worlds Apart. So we've got

46
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:55,160
Leonardo AI and Diffusion B. Now Leonardo AI has a lot of advanced tooling

47
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:59,900
and creativity that you can do within it. Diffusion B on the other hand is a

48
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:04,980
local computer implementation. So in my case it's running on the Mac and it

49
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:09,220
uses stable diffusion and I wasn't really able to get any good images out of

50
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:14,580
this particular model. So for the prompt of the 30 year old man creative

51
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:20,040
animated illustration we've got 16 different variations here and there are

52
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,400
plenty of great contenders to go up against mid-journey in this particular

53
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,040
case. What we'll do now is we'll move on to the next reference image and I'll give

54
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,760
you a little bit more detail about each of these applications as we go. We'll

55
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:39,200
start by dragging the reference image over into DALE-3. We'll also use the

56
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:44,340
mid-journey which had things like the style raw stylized 500. Now this won't

57
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:49,140
be able to be used effectively in the other art generators. So the generation

58
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:53,880
of the prompt is here. Creative realistic illustration of a woman in a 30

59
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:58,220
shown in side profile and we get all that information and this is what we're

60
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:02,500
going to feed into the 16 AI art generators. Moving over to the final

61
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:08,260
overview with this reference image we've again got a lot of great examples. Now

62
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:12,360
if there's a particular tool that you want me to do a deep dive in let me know.

63
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:17,060
Now I am going to do a two or three minute video on pretty much everything

64
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:23,040
that's here but there are a couple here that I'm going to use professionally with

65
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:27,500
my YouTube videos and they're the ones that I'm going to deep dive into. So let

66
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,220
me know which ones you're interested in and I'll do a video on them. Now the

67
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:36,540
first example we've got here is Night Cafe and Idiogram and both images are

68
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:41,840
pretty good in my opinion. Let's talk a little bit about Night Cafe. This tool

69
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:47,440
you can use stable diffusion or DALE-3. You've also got access to print on

70
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,920
demand and can select different art styles. I'll tell you more about Idiogram

71
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:57,160
when we look at the third reference image but moving on we can look at open

72
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:03,240
art and design AI. We've got interesting styles maybe the one from

73
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:08,280
Designs AI isn't as good as the mid-journey one but the open art one is

74
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:13,040
quite impressive. The thing about this particular tool is that apart from image

75
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,780
generation it's pretty good with anime characters and it's also got an image

76
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:24,000
upscaler. Moving on to Blue Willow and a dive firefly. Blue Willow is great as a

77
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,120
tool. It has many different styles that you can work from. It's got some tools

78
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:34,280
like background removers, blurs, 3D models and one of its key advantages is

79
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:39,840
that it's quick at generating images. Let's now have a look at Photor and

80
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:45,200
Crayon. Now Crayon like before doesn't really do a great job of generating

81
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,560
images but Photor is really interesting because not only is it

82
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:54,960
generating a good image but it's a really powerful tool. We've got photo

83
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:00,980
enhancement like upscaling background removal in painting. It's also got

84
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:06,420
realistic human face generation so it can do things like skin tones hair

85
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:12,500
accessories those sorts of features which are really hard to do with general

86
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:17,240
tools like mid-journey. It's got all the different styles of art that you might

87
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:22,160
want to do which you would expect from a lot of the image generations but it can

88
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,500
also do transforms from one style to another. Overall if you want image

89
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:31,560
generation but you also want image editing this might be a great tool to

90
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:37,800
look at. Moving on to Dream Studio and Imagine. We've got good images being

91
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:43,400
generated based on the prompt. Let's talk about Dream Studio. It's by stability AI

92
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:48,960
using the stable diffusion model. Now it's got all your texture image sort of

93
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,600
capabilities. It can also do image to image so you can take an image and

94
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:59,280
alter it and it's got capabilities like image upscaling. Looking now at

95
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,480
playground and hot pot so in this case the images are pretty good. The playground

96
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:10,300
has this really nice user interface and a very generous usage limit on a daily

97
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:16,120
basis. It uses different models it's got various tools and customizations and you

98
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:21,300
can also do image combinations combining images together. Moving on to

99
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:26,520
Let'ssica and Microsoft co-pilot. So Microsoft co-pilot which is DALE-3 we're

100
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:31,220
showing that here. Let'ssica is a search engine now it's got image generation

101
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:37,560
tools. It's got a lot of ability to customize things and look at the history

102
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:43,300
of images and adapt them over time. Moving on to the last two for the Japanese

103
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:49,040
girl. We've got Leonardo AI and Diffusion B and at this point I was nearly giving up

104
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:54,880
on Diffusion B but Leonardo is an incredibly powerful image generation

105
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:01,160
and AI generation tool. You've got capabilities like in-painting, out-painting

106
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:07,060
and magic erasers. You've got Control Net which gives intricate image guidance

107
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:12,940
and the real-time canvas allows you to make modifications to the image quickly

108
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:19,140
and easily. Now moving on to our last reference image which is the lion coming

109
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:22,960
out of the clouds. Now you might have noticed in the last section that I

110
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:28,080
talked a little bit more in detail about each of the image generators but I only

111
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,800
did one of them. Now I'll do the other half in this section. So with the image

112
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,480
we've dragged it into DALE-3. The original prompt was actually quite

113
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:43,320
simple. It was an an angel lion emerging from ash but with the image being

114
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:48,400
dragged into DALE-3 what we finally get is create a powerful and dramatic

115
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:53,920
illustration of a lion with angelic wings. Create a powerful and dramatic

116
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:59,400
illustration of a lion with angelic wings emerging from a cloud of ash. So

117
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:04,600
this is the prompt we're going to use for the 16 generators. So moving on to

118
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:09,460
Night Cafe and Idiogram. In this particular case I really love the image

119
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:15,800
that Idiogram has created. Night Cafe is not too bad. Now the thing about Idiogram

120
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:20,100
is it's a powerful tool. It's designed for both imagers and professionals.

121
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:26,620
It's got preset image stars 3d rendering. It's got community engagement and all

122
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:30,680
the sort of options editing that you would like to do. But additionally

123
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:36,820
it's got a diverse range of visual elements and icons and the other thing

124
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:41,540
that you can do with it is work with text. So you can combine text fonts,

125
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:46,000
colors and different styles with the generation. So let's have a look at

126
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,960
open art and designs AI. We've got pretty good images going on here. Designs AI

127
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:58,500
is an interesting tool. Developed by the Imagine group it's got a bunch of

128
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:04,700
makers. So it's got a text. It's got a logo maker, a video maker, a design maker

129
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,360
and speech maker. So something like the speech maker can be used for voiceovers.

130
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:06,620
and speech maker. So something like the speech maker can be used for voice

131
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:10,900
and speech maker. So something like the speech maker can be used for voiceovers.

132
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,340
The other thing it's got are these pairers. So it's got font pair and color matcher.

133
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:13,600
overs. The other thing it's got are these pairers. So it's got font pair and

134
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,780
The other thing it's got are these pairers. So it's got font pair and color matcher.

135
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:20,220
So an interesting range of tools with this particular product. Next we'll look

136
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:20,700
color matcher. So an interesting range of tools with this particular product.

137
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,460
So an interesting range of tools with this particular product. Next we'll look

138
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,740
at blue willow and a dove firefly. We've got two great images

139
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,000
Next we'll look at blue willow and a dove firefly. We've got two great images

140
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,360
at blue willow and a dove firefly. We've got two great images

141
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,820
going on here. Now a dove's going to be a really powerful tool moving forward.

142
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:35,420
So I guess its main competitor is Canva but it has the ability to integrate into

143
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:40,420
the rest of the adobe products. One of the things it's got is this ethical AI.

144
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:46,420
So it's all trained on images that it has the rights to. And then being a design

145
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:51,860
tool it has generative fill and expand. You can also do vector graphics with it.

146
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:58,200
Move on to photo and crayon. Now crayon has been a tool that I didn't get a

147
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:03,900
lot of success out of it. But it might still be a useful tool for you to use for

148
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:09,440
these reasons. It is a free tool and it has prompt predictions and suggestions.

149
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:13,720
And with a little bit of work you can get an image close to what you might want.

150
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:19,020
Next we'll look at dream studio and imagine art. And they're both producing great

151
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:25,820
images. Now imagine art is a pretty powerful tool. It's got different styles. Image remixing

152
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:31,180
and advanced configuration. It can also do background removal and in painting.

153
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,560
So we're looking at playground and hot pot again. And these are now becoming

154
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:41,360
leading contenders for myself. But let's talk a little bit about hot pot. So it's quite a

155
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:47,860
versatile tool that you can use for image generation. But you can also use it for photo

156
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:53,780
editing, headshots and avatars. One of the other things it can do is text writing.

157
00:12:54,460 --> 00:13:00,800
So you can use it for your brainstorming and copywriting. And like tools like Canva or Firefly

158
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:07,000
it has templates that you can customize for social media. Moving on to Let's Secure and

159
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,680
Microsoft Co-Pilot. The Let's Secure image is really good. The Microsoft Co-Pilot for me is

160
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,940
something that you would use just the same way she would use DALE-3 within chat GPT.

161
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:24,360
Now if you're using Microsoft Co-Pilot you might not want to go any further than this.

162
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:30,140
And if you really want to see a great set of examples of mid-journey versus what

163
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:36,120
Microsoft Co-Pilot could do, you can check out the video that I did last year where I did 400

164
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:43,380
images, 50 prompts, 4 images per prompt for mid-journey and 4 images per prompt for DALE-3,

165
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:48,360
where you can get a good side-by-side comparison between these two different products.

166
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:55,240
And for the last two, Leonardo AI and Diffusion B. So the Leonardo image is pretty good.

167
00:13:55,660 --> 00:14:03,000
The Diffusion B, the thing about this tool is that this image it's done is okay. And it's free,

168
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,780
it runs on your computer. So you have a lot of capability to produce images,

169
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:13,920
but it doesn't necessarily create the best results. But some of the tools that are built into it

170
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:20,660
include in-painting, out-painting and upscaling, and you can plug different models in. So if you

171
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:24,860
know what you're doing, you might be able to get this to a much higher level of capability

172
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:31,380
and just run it locally on your Mac computer in the case of Diffusion B. For Windows, I'm sure

173
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:37,920
there's a tool that does something very similar. So there's 16 great examples of the line coming

174
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:43,900
out of the ashes. We've got the lady in her house Japanese style, and we've got the man in his 30s,

175
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:49,520
yellow background, illustration style. Now, if there's any image generator that you want me
