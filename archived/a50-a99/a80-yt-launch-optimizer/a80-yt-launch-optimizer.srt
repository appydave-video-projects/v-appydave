00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:05,450
In this video, I wanna share my 30 step formula to launching a YouTube video. A few 

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:12,00
months ago, I passed 1000 subscribers and I did that producing a video once every 

3
00:00:12,00 --> 00:00:17,390
three to five weeks. In the last two weeks, I've released five videos, and part of 

4
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,430
that is due to this launch formula.

5
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:23,430
Now, if you like me, you probably thought the hardest part of creating a YouTube 

6
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,550
video is recording and doing the editing. 

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,940
I find that to be the easiest part of the process for me. The hardest part is everything 

8
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:37,500
that goes after I've done my initial recording and post-production. So I've gotta 

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,230
take a video like the one that we've got here and send it to a video editor. I've 

10
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:46,190
just started getting a video editor involved, but that means I've gotta write up 

11
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:52,220
a brief or record all the information to let that person know what I need to do Along 

12
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:56,960
the way, I've gotta create b-roll, so you'll see a lot of b-roll in the intro, what 

13
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,970
you're watching right now of my video, a lot in the outro. Some will be in calls 

14
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:07,700
to action. Next thing I've gotta do is figure out a compelling title, a thumbnail, 

15
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:11,720
the design I want for the thumbnail, the text that I'm going to put on the thumbnail.

16
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:16,420
After that, I've gotta do a whole lot of post-analysis on the transcript. I need 

17
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:21,490
to work out what keywords, the chapters that need to go into the YouTube description. 

18
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:26,320
Is there any sort of branding or affiliate information I wanna put in? I often like 

19
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:32,500
to share my videos on Twitter or LinkedIn, so how do I write the LinkedIn post? How 

20
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,100
do I write the tweet or any other social media post for that matter? 

21
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:41,230
I'm also often trying to do an analysis of the text for things like what was the 

22
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:46,960
topic, what might be the search terms, and if my video editor produces a YouTube 

23
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,440
short for me, I've gotta go through the same process again. I've gotta come up with 

24
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,260
a title. I've gotta come up with a YouTube description.

25
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:57,880
As a YouTuber that talks about prompt engineering and AI agents, you can imagine 

26
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:03,940
that I'm using these sort of technologies to automate my own problems. And the software 

27
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:08,140
I have is called Agent Workflow Builder. It's in development at the moment, but you 

28
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:12,970
can find a link in the description if you want to have early access to it. Otherwise, 

29
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:14,650
like and subscribe and let's get into it.

30
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:18,900
So let's have a look at the video. We're going to launch and we're here in a product 

31
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:24,530
called Gling. It's a pretty good video editing software that allows you to edit videos 

32
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:25,880
using just text. 

33
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:30,220
as we look through it, we've got areas of the screen that I've recorded using E Cam 

34
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,320
live, another product that IU, 

35
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:37,670
love to use. But if we go up to the intro, there's no graphics. It's just me in my 

36
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:38,900
living room at the moment. 

37
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:43,610
And this is an area that we are going to need to get some b-roll and put it behind. 

38
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:47,340
you would've noticed that I'm using a green screen for the intro so that I can make 

39
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,370
the b-roll look more effective than I've done in the past.

40
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,380
let's have a look at the files that are involved. So we're currently in the Launch 

41
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:58,400
optimizer, which is the video I'm recording right now, but we'll move up to the agent 

42
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:05,960
workflow intro/outro. And this was an ability to improve my intros and improve my 

43
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:09,770
outros based on the previous and the next videos. And when I recorded it, we have 

44
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:14,840
this video here. We have a whole lot of recordings that I'd done and put through 

45
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:19,520
that Gling video editor that we're talking about. There's also the idea of assets, 

46
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:24,380
which we're going to create as part of this particular process. And if we just open 

47
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,640
up the video, we can see 

48
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:29,750
that I have this nine minute video. We've got the areas that I'm gonna need to get 

49
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:34,130
the video editor to add B roll. And then when we get into the video, he's going to 

50
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,470
have to do a whole lot of transitions and sound 

51
00:03:37,00 --> 00:03:42,450
Now the most useful file in this particular workflow is the SRT file. What that is 

52
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,460
is the subtext file. It's got all the words that I said, the time that I said them, 

53
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,680
and the sequence that they happened in. 

54
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:53,300
that's going to be uploaded into the YouTube as the, 

55
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:58,850
lower thirds. But we are also got a copy of it as just raw text, and we're going 

56
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:03,740
to take a copy of that. 'cause I'm going to run every process of this one transcript.

57
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,840
So here's the workflow we're going to operate. It's the YouTube launch optimizer. 

58
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,540
It's based on a bunch of sections. There are currently 31 steps, and this keeps growing. 

59
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:17,800
So we'll work through the video preparation, building the chapters for the video, 

60
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:23,740
any B roll suggestions that we need in the intro, outro or elsewhere. We've got content 

61
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:28,480
analysis, like what's the theme, the keywords, the title and the thumbnail will work 

62
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:32,830
through. And then we're looking at the metadata, which is mostly the information 

63
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:36,910
that goes into the YouTube description. And lastly, we'll create a couple of social 

64
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:41,230
media posts. And what we can do is go straight into configuration, and I'm just going 

65
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:45,580
to go down to where the transcript is and I'm going to paste all that information 

66
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:45,730
in.

67
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:49,740
Now I've come through and filled in a few other pieces of information. I already 

68
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:54,990
know a bunch of calls to action and information about my brand, but what I'd like 

69
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:57,540
to do is fill in the short title. 

70
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,760
So I have a prompt here that'll use the transcript. 

71
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,250
if we look at what it's produced, we can see a bunch of short titles I could go with. 

72
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:09,600
And I looked through this. And for me, I think the creating effective intros and 

73
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,950
outros is the best way to go. So I'm just going to add it into the workflow.

74
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,600
Next I want to get a summary of the transcript and I often use that for tweets and 

75
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:23,430
other areas. So what I've done is created one. We are just going to copy it, I've 

76
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:27,990
read through it, it's quite accurate, and we can just come back, move on to the next 

77
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,730
step and we'll just paste it in. 

78
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,700
after that we'll try and create an abridgement, which is a similar sort of document, 

79
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:39,280
but with a little bit more depth to it and not a loss of facts. So the information 

80
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,630
that's coming through right now, 

81
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:45,470
we'll run the validation. I don't always do that 'cause I tend to trust what comes 

82
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:50,900
through. I like to observe it because one of the things that does bring up is that 

83
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:56,210
there might not be as much information in the in bridgement as in the transcript, 

84
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:59,360
and I can check it just to make sure there's nothing missing.

85
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,700
So I'm glad I looked through this. Usually I don't have to worry about what's in 

86
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:08,280
here, but of the 10 items that are listed, three of them probably should be added 

87
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:12,750
into the abridgement. They'll make a lot of sense when I do the LinkedIn post, which 

88
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:18,810
usually uses the abridgement to figure out what to write. And it's things like number 

89
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:24,750
six, the reverse engineering of the Vid IQ strategy is probably an important thing 

90
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:29,130
to talk about. But other things like anecdotes and observations, they don't really 

91
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:33,450
make much sense in an in bridgement 'cause I don't really need 'em in the sort of 

92
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:38,280
documents and social content that I create. So we're just going to run this little 

93
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:43,320
prompt here and just make sure these additional pieces of information go into the 

94
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:43,920
abridgement. 

95
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:47,950
So I've just taken a copy of that information and I'm just going to update 

96
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:52,670
My next step is to separate the intro and the outro from the transcript, and I've 

97
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:57,410
got a few different usages for it. The main one is the B-roll, but in the future 

98
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:02,390
I'd like to do an analysis of them to see whether they can be improved. So what I've 

99
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:07,760
got is a copy of this prompt just running through, and we've pulled out the intro 

100
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,680
here and we've pulled out the outro. 

101
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:10,930
just gonna 

102
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,860
and make sure it's in the outro section, 

103
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:16,640
we're looking at the video in Gling and we're seeing the intro that it's extracted 

104
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:20,570
and we can see that they're the same. Hi, you are creating videos for YouTube. It's 

105
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:24,980
the same as what we got in Gling. And this goes all the way through to what would 

106
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:30,710
happen if I had a script pre-prepared. And we can see that there. And when I read 

107
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:36,650
this intro, this is clearly the same information. The problem I've got is that I 

108
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:41,510
need to get B-roll for everywhere from this section that we're seeing. But I also 

109
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:42,590
need it for this section 

110
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:48,440
linguistically it's not the intro. So chat, GPT got the right information for me, 

111
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:53,270
but personally I'm gonna want this extra information as well. So I've just asked 

112
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,950
Chat GPT to add it 

113
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,220
we'll come over to the workflow. We'll put in the introduction 

114
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:03,380
what we've done now is we've completed the video preparation area, we've configured, 

115
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:08,480
got the summary abridgement, we've checked the quality of it, separated the intro 

116
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:13,100
and the outro. And the last thing is I like to save an outcome notes so that I've 

117
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:14,520
got all this information recorded.

118
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:19,630
the next section in my workflow is finding and developing the chapters. And this 

119
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:24,400
is not an area that's working too well for me just yet, but I'm going to show you 

120
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,860
what I've got. So firstly, I wanna find the chapters. So if we go over to the GPT 

121
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:33,730
that I've just run, we can see that we've got chapter 

122
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:38,140
examples. These are headings that we could go with and the words that were said at 

123
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:38,860
each point. 

124
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:43,970
I will use this as a baseline and I definitely take a copy of it, but at the moment 

125
00:08:44,90 --> 00:08:48,560
I'm still looking through my video trying to find the chapters I've worked through 

126
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:55,130
the idea of using the SRT file as a way of figuring out timings and coming up with 

127
00:08:55,130 --> 00:09:00,290
better terminology where it comes up with the times and simple names for chapters, 

128
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:04,400
but it doesn't work too well. I've also used all the tools out there, and so far 

129
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:08,660
I haven't found something that I like to use, but this is a problem that I'll solve 

130
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,210
over time, or I'll find a third party tool.

131
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:16,270
I'm just in my outcomes document. This is the information that chat GPT came up with 

132
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:21,760
for me. And what I did was I watched the video on double time. It's a nine minute 

133
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:27,850
video, and this took me about 15 to 20 minutes to do. So it's a bit of an arduous 

134
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:32,620
task just for chapters, but it's one of the things that I think from a quality point 

135
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:37,360
of view is really important to get right in your YouTube description. So I've broken 

136
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,740
it down into intros and outros, the struggle that's mapping to this. And as I was 

137
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:47,140
going through, I was often using the headings for inspiration, but then rewriting 

138
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:50,860
'em based on what I saw. So we'll take a copy of that 

139
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,970
I'm just gonna paste it into the chapters 

140
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,910
I wanna generate a bunch of B-roll for the intro and outro and other areas. 

141
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:01,540
I'm going to do that in Leonardo ai. And so we're in this section at the moment called 

142
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:05,920
the B-Roll Suggestions. We'll do the intro outro B-roll. We're also going to create 

143
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,960
a brief for the video editor so that he knows what to do. And we're also gonna think 

144
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,500
about design style and transcript design ideas. 

145
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:20,680
So I've just come over to A GPT, which is in the middle of creating intros and outro 

146
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:25,480
graphics. But let's go to the top of it. We've got concepts. So the first idea is 

147
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:30,430
in the intro, we've got struggling. We've creating intros and outros for YouTube 

148
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:34,900
videos. That's something I talk about in the video. Increased video production quality 

149
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,550
after hiring an editor. 

150
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,750
this was just a statement that I made, and it might be useful to have that as b-roll 

151
00:10:42,60 --> 00:10:46,980
in the background. And it's just developing different ideas that are visually appealing 

152
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,740
for all the sentences in the intro and the outro. 

153
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,120
After the intro outro concepts that we've got here, we start seeing the prompts and 

154
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,470
they're going to match. So number one, which is struggling with creating intros and 

155
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:04,140
outros for YouTube videos are going to fit with one A and one b. I tend to create 

156
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:08,460
two prompts for each area, and we've got a frustrated content creator struggling 

157
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:13,740
with video editing, specifically focusing on intro and outro segments. And then we've 

158
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:18,360
got another one here, illustration of a YouTube creator puzzled by the intros and 

159
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:24,450
outros of videos. And that just repeats for all six concepts in the intro. And in 

160
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:29,310
this case, there were six concepts in the outro. And we can use this over in Midjourney, 

161
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,620
or I like to use Leonardo ai.

162
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:39,290
Now we're over in the personal feed of Leonardo ai and I've generated about 96 images 

163
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:42,350
through here for both the intro and the outro. 

164
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:47,490
So if we look at these images here, we've got a YouTube creator with a mixture of 

165
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:52,770
anxiety. And what I've done is I've come over to my computer and I've downloaded 

166
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:57,840
and renamed every image, and we can see those particular images we were just talking 

167
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,260
about 

168
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:02,560
Now, as I was doing this, this took me about 10 or 15 minutes just to rename the 

169
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,500
files. So when I got to the outro, 

170
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:07,280
I decided to automate that. 

171
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:10,330
yesterday I took an hour and a half out to create a video. 

172
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,910
In the middle of recording this video, I realized just how long it took me to rename 

173
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:19,890
the files, and I thought, I'll show you a little automation. And what I did was I 

174
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:25,350
went straight to chat, GPT, voice mode. It's a new feature that came in chat, GPT. 

175
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:30,660
I just had a conversation with it about how I could automate that and it wrote the 

176
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:35,160
script for me in about 10 minutes. And then when I got all these files here, I didn't 

177
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:39,990
have to come through and manually rename them, and that was taking me 10 to 15 minutes 

178
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:41,160
to do that alone.

179
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:46,130
the next step I have is letting my video editor know what instructions I want. So 

180
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:51,380
I have these basic general instructions that I want worked on. We've got the intro 

181
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:56,540
and outro ideas, and then I just pass in the special instructions chapters and the 

182
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:01,970
intro outro ideas. And here's an example of what we got. We've got video editing 

183
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:07,130
brief for intros and outros. We got stuff around the intro outro, the chapter breakdown 

184
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:08,750
so they know where to look at 

185
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:14,170
particularly for transitions and maybe some b-roll graphics, extra special instructions, 

186
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,190
and CTA, 

187
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:20,190
because one of the things I've found in the past is that I want the calls to action 

188
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:25,500
to look a little bit more impressive than other areas of the system. And it's about 

189
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,590
notifying the video editor of that requirement.

190
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:28,650
Okay, 

191
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:33,850
coming back to the B-roll images, you might have noticed that there's no design consistency 

192
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:38,140
going on. Everything looks pretty good individually, but 

193
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:43,580
as a collective in a video, it's not that great. So can we fix that? And that's what 

194
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:49,160
the next step is about. This is design style list. So with this particular prompt, 

195
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:53,390
we're trying to figure out if there's a look and feel that I want in the video.

196
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:57,740
So coming over to chat GPT, we've got 10 different styles. They're all based off 

197
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:03,170
the transcript that we just wrote and included. And the one that might look good 

198
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:04,940
could be the workflow mind map. 

199
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:10,630
We come and have a look at the next step, and this is about taking one of those ideas 

200
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:15,250
and any other special instructions and taking the original set of prompts, and let's 

201
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,750
make 'em more the same style. 

202
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:21,430
here I've said I want to use workflow, my map style, but every time you do it, I 

203
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:26,410
need the words agent workflow builder, in quotes. Now I'm just saying that because 

204
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,350
that's what this software is, it's agent workflow builder. 

205
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,280
if you're looking at a way of automating any standard operating procedure in this 

206
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:39,590
particular case, it's a YouTube launch sequence. Then maybe check out the link in 

207
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:40,100
the description below.

208
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:46,390
Now heading over to GPT, we can see that list of files have come through. The fourth 

209
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:52,90
item in this CSV file is the prompt, and one of the things that you'll notice is 

210
00:14:52,90 --> 00:14:55,960
that the word agent workflow builder is built into all of these. 

211
00:14:55,990 --> 00:15:00,380
So I've just taken three prompts from that list and let's just look at a couple of 

212
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:04,430
them. So here we've got the word agent workflow builder. Not very legible, but it's 

213
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:09,890
there. In this particular version, we've got more agent workflow builder as part 

214
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:15,590
of a sign, which is interesting. Here. It becomes very clear, and I'm actually loving 

215
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:20,630
these ones, so much so that I might end up downloading them and using in the video 

216
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:25,550
because they're very professional. Now, we still haven't quite got the style right 

217
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:29,840
between them all because I didn't put a lot of effort into that. But let's have a 

218
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,450
look at what you could do.

219
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:35,730
Now to see a good example of this image, consistency in action. You can see a video 

220
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:43,530
I released yesterday on my other channel, AI-TLDR This channel is about AI technology, 

221
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:48,690
but it's done creating by using AI technology to create it, and the clue is to do 

222
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:54,990
less, or clueless is a little coding language that I'm creating to allow me to create 

223
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:59,310
videos really quickly. If you wanna find out more about that, check out the link 

224
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:05,280
in the description, or if you just wanna see a great example of consistent storyboards, 

225
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:08,200
come out and check this video on AI-TLDR.

226
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:13,930
Now what I wanna do is get content analysis out of the transcript. We've got the 

227
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:17,830
essence, the audience engagement, and the call to action plus competitors. 

228
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:21,620
if we look at the first one, we're going to identify the main topic and theme, and 

229
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,810
we've got three other points that we look into.

230
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:29,770
I repeat that for the audience engagement and the cost action and competitors. And 

231
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:34,930
if we go and have a look at things, we've got a main topic, so it's figured that 

232
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:39,340
out. This is an important piece of information I use to steer different articles 

233
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:43,180
and tweets and that that I create. We've got keywords that could be useful in the 

234
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:47,710
YouTube description. There could be important statistics. You might wanna communicate 

235
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:53,440
this to your video editor so that they highlight it during the video creation. Same 

236
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,460
thing with the key takeaway.

237
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:59,500
I have a section here on the audience engagement. We've got emotional triggers, overall 

238
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:04,00
tone, style, audience insights. So far, I haven't used this a whole lot, and you 

239
00:17:04,00 --> 00:17:08,850
can see because I'm very dry in my delivery, there's a lot in here that I could take 

240
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:13,830
into future videos, but if we go down the bottom, we've got all the calls to action 

241
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:17,490
and maybe search terms that you can use around this topic.

242
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:22,430
We've now moved into the next phase, which is creating the thumbnails, the text that 

243
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:26,990
goes in the thumbnail and the title of the video. So what we'll do is I'm going to 

244
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:31,280
start off with just a short idea for a title that I came up right at the beginning 

245
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:36,290
of this session, and I'm just going to throw in the main topic as described in the 

246
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:41,540
last content analysis phase. Now, in the past, I've used something as simple as this, 

247
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:45,950
and some keywords, I just take it a little bit further. Sometimes I'll also use the 

248
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:50,450
transcript or the transcript summary, but I find just knowing the topic theme 

249
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:53,760
Here we've got some content highlights. We'll just paste them in 

250
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:59,130
and we'll just run the prompt related to that. And we're getting a bunch of YouTube 

251
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:04,320
titles coming through. Now, I can usually work something a little bit manual from 

252
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,940
this. I don't always go exactly what's here. Sometimes I'll run it again, but I find 

253
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:13,560
this a pretty effective way of getting my first draft of a YouTube title.

254
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:18,220
Next, I wanna get the text that goes on our thumbnail. Now if you look at the thumbnails 

255
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:23,860
I currently do, you'll see that there's different areas of text and there's also 

256
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,730
a title that they're related to. 

257
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,850
I try to do is something 

258
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:30,880
contrary, the words on the thumbnail just need to be a little bit different to the 

259
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,180
words on the title. You don't need to say the same thing twice. 

260
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:38,300
we've got a prompt here that we'll take the title that we're going to go with. I've 

261
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:43,310
decided on automate intros and outros for better continuity between videos. 

262
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:47,200
I've also listed all the others because there's probably good wording in here that 

263
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:50,110
we can do a contrary point of view on. 

264
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:53,520
we've also got the theme and the content highlights available. 

265
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:58,590
we've had five engaging thumbnail text ideas based on the provided information, 

266
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:02,760
and I'm just going to increase it by another five. The things that I'm looking for 

267
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:07,320
are the parts, the one, two, and three, where there's usually really good words that 

268
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,860
can be taken from here and used on the thumb.

269
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:15,990
Next, I wanna format this information so I can bring it directly into Canva. 

270
00:19:16,00 --> 00:19:21,340
take the table that we've got here and rerun it again this time in a CSV format. 

271
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,940
And I'll just use the bulk image upload within Canva to see all these text elements.

272
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,410
come over to Canva and I've got a template that I've pre-designed, and I've just 

273
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,390
uploaded the CSV file and we can see 'em all listed here. So then when I generate 

274
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:42,360
10 designs, what we're gonna see is different combinations of text based on different 

275
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:47,100
title ideas and concepts. And I can just click through these and if there's any words 

276
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,920
that I want to use, just use it in my 

277
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:50,750
thumbnail template.

278
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:55,120
At this point, I generate a template just to get started. We've got a few different 

279
00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:00,460
designs we can work with, different images of me that I can add to the system, some 

280
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:04,210
examples that I've done in the past. And one of the things that I'll do near the 

281
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:07,260
front is I'll drag any images that we're about to generate 

282
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:09,270
I've trained in some images into the 

283
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:14,550
we can see that the prompt that I used took the title, the content highlights, and 

284
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:19,680
the title ideas. And from there we've generated this extracted information about 

285
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:24,960
the theme, the highlight, the power of automation. But the main thing going on is 

286
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,830
that there's an area for different prompts. So we can look at the robotic arm. If 

287
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:33,660
we go further down, we can look at the large clock with the faster moving hand.

288
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:37,760
So here we have our robot with the intro and the outro, and if we go to the top, 

289
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:42,190
we've got our clock with the fast moving hands, we've got YouTube variations of it 

290
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:42,350
as well.

291
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:46,650
Now we just finished the setup for the titles, the thumbnail elements, the text that 

292
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:51,30
goes onto 'em. The next thing that I have to do when publishing a video is getting 

293
00:20:51,30 --> 00:20:54,840
the YouTube description, and one of the things I'm gonna need are the keywords. Now 

294
00:20:54,840 --> 00:21:00,810
we have a bunch of keywords that we found during the content analysis phase. We've 

295
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:03,660
also got the title that we're using and the abridgement.

296
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:08,460
I've gone and run that prompt and we can see here a struggling to create smooth intros 

297
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:13,410
and outros in your YouTube videos. So we have this basic sort of description. Now, 

298
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:17,700
how does that fit with a regular YouTube description? If we look at one of the videos 

299
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:22,560
I've already done in the past, you can see there's many areas of the YouTube description 

300
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:27,720
including keywords, affiliate links, branding, social media. But the section we just 

301
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:32,550
generated would be this area here. It's the basic idea of what the video is meant 

302
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:34,950
to be about. Let's move on and build the rest of this.

303
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,850
So we'll come back to the description, take a copy of it, and we'll move on to the 

304
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:43,720
writing of the description where we've got a whole lot of extra information that 

305
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:48,280
I just talked about. We'll just paste in the simple YouTube description. You can 

306
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:52,300
see above. We've got the chapters and all that. And make a copy of what we've got 

307
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:52,720
here 

308
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:58,200
and I'll just paste it into chat, GPT. You can also use anthropic if you want, and 

309
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,730
it'll start generating a more detailed YouTube description. 

310
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:07,520
Now, I haven't uploaded this video yet, so I can't put it into YouTube, but what 

311
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:12,380
you can see over here on the left is the original text and we got it visualized on 

312
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:17,930
the right. And this first area is something to look at mainly because this is the 

313
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:21,530
stuff that goes above the fold. And what that means is that when someone's looking 

314
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,620
at a video, but they haven't opened up the description, 

315
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:27,560
Everything above the fold should be high priority. 

316
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:31,980
one of the things that I've done here is had a link to an opt-in for one of my e 

317
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:35,520
products. Or sometimes I'll use the buy me a coffee link.

318
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:40,130
And then when they expand the description, there might be another high level opt-in 

319
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:44,480
that you want to have, plus the rest of the information comes down in the appropriate 

320
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:44,900
order.

321
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:49,440
this is an evolving system, so there's other steps here that I'm not currently using, 

322
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,690
like the pinned comments, but they'll come over time. But let's move into the last 

323
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:58,410
phase. And the last phase is how are you going to share the YouTube video? Are you 

324
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:02,430
gonna share it with LinkedIn? Are you going to write a medium article or maybe a 

325
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:02,850
tweet? 

326
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:08,540
the ones I do generally at the moment are tweets and LinkedIn articles. So we'll 

327
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:10,460
just go straight in and have a look at them.

328
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:15,120
Now we're in the social media post phase, and we can see for creating a tweet that 

329
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,800
I need the title of the video. We've got some keywords that can be used, and basically 

330
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:24,690
a summary, which is a bit smaller than the transcript or the abridgement, and we'll 

331
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:27,990
paste in a link. Now, I haven't uploaded the videos, so this is just one of my other 

332
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:32,580
videos for now, and we'll move through to the LinkedIn post. I don't tend to do a 

333
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:38,640
Facebook post anymore, and the information here is exactly the same, though I like 

334
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,390
to use the Abridgement because it's more detailed than the summary.

335
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:46,540
here we have five tweets that have been created. We've got the information that's 

336
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:51,310
related to the video keywords, and then we've got the link at the bottom. You can 

337
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:56,740
pick one of the ones you want or rewrite A as see fit as we scroll down. You'll also 

338
00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:01,750
see that there's a LinkedIn post being generated and it'll be way more detailed. 

339
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:05,350
It's not based on the summary, it's based on the abridgement, and it'll have the 

340
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:09,550
video at the end. And the way they can look is that we've got different tweets that 

341
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:14,500
we've been able to put out in the past, and if we go over to the LinkedIn posts, 

342
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:19,810
you can see a bunch of LinkedIn posts that I get a lot of engagement from. And this 

343
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:23,680
I find a great way to send traffic back to the YouTube channel.

344
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:28,940
So there you have my extensive launch sequence. This is everything I do to get a 

345
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:35,660
video released and up onto YouTube and published. This takes about 30 steps, and 

346
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:40,130
in the past I used to take three to five weeks to get a video out. I'm now down to 

347
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:45,830
about one or two videos a week, and it's GPT workflows like this that help me. So 

348
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:49,880
if you're interested in the agent workflow builder, there's a link in the description. 

349
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:53,690
It's software that I'm building and we'll make available soon.

350
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:58,880
I'm AppyDave. I do videos generally on GPT, prompt Engineering and this agent workflow 

351
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:04,430
tool that I'm building. Please like and subscribe or click on the buy me a coffee 

352
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:08,480
link. That's one of the ways that funds this particular channel and the content that 

353
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,150
I'm creating. Anyway, I'll see in the next video.
