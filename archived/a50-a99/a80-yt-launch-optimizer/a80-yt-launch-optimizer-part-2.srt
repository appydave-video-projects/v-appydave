1
00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:04,830
So here we have our robot with the intro and the outro. And if we go to the top, 

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,360
we've got our clock with the fast moving hands. We've got YouTube variations of it 

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:09,690
as well.

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:13,970
Now we just finished the set up for the titles, the thumbnail elements, the text 

5
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:18,170
that goes onto them. The next thing that I have to do when publishing a video is 

6
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:21,470
getting the YouTube description. And one of the things I'm going to need are the 

7
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:27,680
keywords. Now we have a bunch of keywords that we found during the content analysis 

8
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,730
phase. We've also got the title that we're using and the abridgement.

9
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:31,820
Now I've got to 

10
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:36,540
that prompt and we can see here a struggling to create smooth intros and outros in 

11
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,520
your YouTube videos. So we have this basic sort of description. Now how does that 

12
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,930
fit with a regular YouTube description? If we look at one of the videos I've already 

13
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:50,670
done in the past, you can see there's many areas of the YouTube description, including 

14
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:55,890
keywords, affiliate links, branding, social media. But the section we just generated 

15
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,870
would be this area here. It's the basic idea of what the video is meant to be about. 

16
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,700
Let's move on and build the rest of this.

17
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:07,690
So we'll come back to the description, take a copy of it, and we'll move on to the 

18
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:11,560
writing of the description, where we've got a whole lot of extra information that 

19
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:16,360
I just talked about. We'll just paste in the simple YouTube description you can see 

20
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,710
above. We've got the chapters and all that and make a copy of what we've got here, 

21
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:26,710
and I'll just paste it into ChatGPT. You can also use anthropic if you want, and 

22
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:31,360
it'll start generating a more detailed YouTube description.

23
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,620
Now I have uploaded this video yet so I can't put it into YouTube. But what you can 

24
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:41,750
see over here on the left is the original text and we got it visualized on the right. 

25
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:46,370
And this first area is something to look at, mainly because this is the stuff that 

26
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:51,170
goes above the fold. And what that means is that when someone's looking at a video 

27
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:55,730
but they haven't opened up the description, everything above the fold should be the 

28
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:56,120
highest 

29
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:01,310
priority. So one of the things that I've done here is had a link to an opt in for 

30
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:05,690
one of my products, or sometimes I'll use the buy me a coffee link.

31
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,290
And then when they expand the description, there might be another high level opt 

32
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:14,820
in that you want to have. Plus, the rest of the information comes down in the appropriate 

33
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:15,300
order.

34
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:19,770
Now this is an evolving system. So there's other steps here that I'm not currently 

35
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:24,510
using like the pinned comments, but they'll come over time. But let's move into the 

36
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:29,160
last phase. And the last phase is how are you going to share the YouTube video? Are 

37
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,180
you going to share it with LinkedIn? Are you going to write a medium article or maybe 

38
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:39,270
a tweet? Now the ones I do generally at the moment are tweets and LinkedIn articles. 

39
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:41,670
So we'll just go straight in and have a look at them.

40
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:46,400
we're in the social media post phase, and we can see for creating a tweet that I 

41
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,900
need the title of the video. We've got some keywords that can be used and basically 

42
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:55,190
a summary which is a bit smaller than the transcript or the abridgement, and we'll 

43
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:59,690
paste in a link. Now I haven't uploaded the video, so this is just one of my other 

44
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:02,720
videos for now, and we'll move through to the LinkedIn post. 

45
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:07,370
information here is exactly the same, though I like to use the abridgement because 

46
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,320
it's more detailed than the summary.

47
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:13,760
we have five tweets that are being created. We've got the information that's related 

48
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,500
to the video keywords. And then we've got the link at the bottom. You can pick one 

49
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:23,600
of the ones you want or rewrite them as you see fit. As we scroll down, you'll also 

50
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:28,490
see that there's a LinkedIn post being generated and it'll be way more detailed. 

51
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:31,130
It's not based on the summary, it's based on the abridgment. 

52
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:32,580
it'll have the video at the end. 

53
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:36,550
the way they can look is that we've got different tweets that we've been able to 

54
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:41,650
put out in the past, and if we go over to the LinkedIn posts, you can see a bunch 

55
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:46,750
of LinkedIn posts that I get a lot of engagement from. And this is I find a great 

56
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,750
way to send traffic back to the YouTube channel.

57
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:55,140
So there you have my extensive launch sequence. This is everything I do to get a 

58
00:03:55,140 --> 00:04:01,830
video released and up onto YouTube and published. This takes about 30 steps, and 

59
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:06,630
in the past I used to take 3 to 5 weeks to get a video out. I'm now down to about 

60
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:11,520
1 or 2 videos a week, and it's GPT workflows like this that help me. 

61
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:15,520
if you're interested in the Agent Workflow Builder, there's a link in the description. 

62
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,670
It's software that I'm building and will make available soon.

63
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:24,540
I'm AppyDave. I do videos generally on GPT Prompt Engineering and this agent workflow 

64
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:29,640
tool that I'm building. Please like and subscribe or click on the Buy Me a Coffee 

65
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:34,110
link. That's one of the ways that funds this particular channel and the content that 

66
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,960
I'm creating. Anyway, I'll see you in the next video.
