Hi, are you trying to create videos for YouTube and you struggle with either the 

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:09,00
intro or the outro component of the video? I'm AppyDave, and in this video we're 

3
00:00:09,00 --> 00:00:14,760
going to look at an AI agent workflow to help improve both our intros and our 

4
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,530
I've been creating videos on this channel for about a year now, and I've never really 

5
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:24,270
been able to create more than one video every three to five weeks. Now, at the beginning 

6
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:29,340
of the month, I decided to get a video editor, and I've seen the quality of the production 

7
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:34,260
go up in my videos, and I'm now getting to about one a week, which I'm happy about. 

8
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:40,140
But I was analyzing just what I was saying in the videos, and I thought my quality 

9
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,150
of what I say is going down. 

10
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,400
a lot of that has to do with what I'm doing right now is an ad hoc script. I'm just 

11
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,930
saying what comes to my mind, and that just doesn't come across with the impact, 

12
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:56,400
the clarity, or the snappiness that would happen if I had a script pre-prepared.

13
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,710
This morning I was about to create the third video in a particular series that I'm 

14
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:05,780
doing, and I realized I didn't know what the video before it was about. I had a vague 

15
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:10,670
idea, but I didn't know the details. And in the intro of the video I wanted to do, 

16
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:14,240
I wanted to reference the ideas from the previous video. 

17
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:19,220
last week I also did a video based on something from Vid IQ where they talked about 

18
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:24,110
doing the other end of it. How do you create an outro that gets people to move to 

19
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:29,450
the next video in the series? So today I thought I'd expand on that particular workflow 

20
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,910
and we'll look at how can we do an intro that talks about the previous video as a 

21
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:36,740
context for the video that we're watching.

22
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:42,310
So let's have a look at some formulas for intros and outros. Now, recently I did 

23
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:48,970
an outro formula based on getting 4,000 watch hours quickly, and this is from a video 

24
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:49,840
by Vid IQ. 

25
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:54,910
What I did was I reverse engineered their ideas and came up with my own flow. But 

26
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:59,410
essentially what it is, is you've got a video that you're talking about and you want 

27
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:04,690
to introduce the next video with a call to action so that people go on, what's that 

28
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,450
next? And the technique is called the outro formula. 

29
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:12,130
the basic information you need to make this work in an automation is that you need 

30
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:16,480
the current video script and you just need to know the goal of the next video, and 

31
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,100
it writes the script for you.

32
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:22,590
So I built this workflow called the YouTube Outro Bridge, 

33
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:26,540
it would take the abridgement or the transcript of the current video, the next video 

34
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:27,600
goal, 

35
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:31,120
run it through a prompt so it could figure out all the details that it needed to 

36
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,560
gather. 

37
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:36,150
from there it could move on with the next goal and the content analysis that it just 

38
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:39,750
built, and write a script that I could then read out.

39
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,900
Now if you want more information on that video, you can go and watch the video on 

40
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:48,850
the Vid IQ strategy, which was the video at the top that I reverse engineered into 

41
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:50,500
a GPT automation.

42
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:55,570
Now let's look at the intro formula because it's very similar and it's designed for 

43
00:02:55,570 --> 00:03:00,820
when you've got a multi-episode and you wanna do a recap on the previous video and 

44
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,100
bring it into the one that people are watching. 

45
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,560
the flow is simply in the current video 

46
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:10,480
episode recap, call to action based on the last video. So the technique, I'm just 

47
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:16,960
calling the episode recap formula and the information we need is the last episode's 

48
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:21,760
transcript and whatever the current goal or the current script, if you've already 

49
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,860
done that for the video, we're on.

50
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:27,770
Now I'm going to extend the old workflow, which was called YouTube Outro Bridge. 

51
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:33,560
It had a content analysis phase and a writing of the outro, and it looked like 

52
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:38,110
steps. And what I've done is I've gone and created a new one called YouTube Intro 

53
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:43,570
Booster, and it should have the same steps for the outro. There's slight naming conventions 

54
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:49,420
going on. We've got the outro booster, but then after that I now have an intro recap 

55
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:53,710
content analysis, and we're going to have to put in a prompt here, and then there'll 

56
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:57,340
be the right outro booster script. So let's go and look at those prompts.

57
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,40
Now sometimes when I write prompts I'll use the anthropic 

58
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:05,770
prompt generator. I find it to be very powerful and that's exactly how I created 

59
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,450
the last two prompts. 

60
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:11,770
I'm going to take the last two prompts 'cause they are very good. They're designed 

61
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:16,390
for the outro bridge. We've got number one, which is the analysis, and if we go down 

62
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:19,840
a bit further, we should have number two, which is for the script. 

63
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:24,840
make a slight modification to the top of this. We'll inject a prompt that says I 

64
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:30,450
need you to create the intro recap episode, both an analysis and a script. 

65
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:34,690
given a slightly different goal. Main goal is the intro recap is to provide a brief 

66
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:40,60
overview of the previous videos content and set the stage for the current video. 

67
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:45,320
I want it to be short, only one to two sentences. 'cause unlike the outro bridge 

68
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:50,90
where it's really clear that you want people to move to that video, it's not necessarily 

69
00:04:50,90 --> 00:04:54,590
clear that you want people to go back to a previous video. So I'm keeping it fairly 

70
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:54,560
simple 

71
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,950
and telling it what three variables are available.

72
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,840
So instead of using the anthropic, I'm going to use the o1-preview, which is incredibly 

73
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,760
powerful. I've pasted in that prompt, and we can see that after a while, it starts 

74
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,130
thinking we've got 19 seconds 

75
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:14,540
a chain of thought going on here, and we've got two prompts that I can work with. 

76
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:19,250
We've got the oh two one intro recap episode. The only thing I've gotta do is make 

77
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,820
sure I remove this information and we've got it repeated again. 

78
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:27,930
copy those and we'll head back to where we've got number one and two, which are not 

79
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:32,190
yet filled in, and we'll just refresh the page. And now we've got number one filled 

80
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,500
in for us. We've got number two filled 

81
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,90
Let's go find the information that we want to do a recap on. 

82
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:42,870
I generally talk about four different topics. That's either YouTube, automation, 

83
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:48,510
AI agents, which is what we're looking at right now, coding or general purpose topics. 

84
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:54,240
And what happens is I'll end up doing things in a series, and the series might be 

85
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,840
Fli-Video If I'm doing either YouTube automation 

86
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:03,570
and I tend to do my YouTube automated content over on the AI-TLDR channel. This is 

87
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,630
videos that are generated using AI 

88
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,930
or I'm working on workflow automation, which is what we are looking at 

89
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:15,170
that I use all the time in my own videos. And the one that we were just talking about, 

90
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:21,200
the outro booster being here, I stole video queue's, 4,000 watch hour strategy is 

91
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,930
what I use when I go want to go to the next video. 

92
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,550
but in this case, we actually wanna link back to this video. So if we come back to 

93
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:33,950
the mind map where we've got the agent workflow builder and the series goal is building 

94
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:39,470
automations and standard operating procedures for businesses, we can see that the 

95
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:45,200
current video I'm working on, I've coded it as number 79, but the previous one was 

96
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:46,700
video number 71.

97
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:50,360
I'm just over at a document that I created last week. It was for 

98
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,930
Vid IQs 4,000 Watch hour strategy. I've got all the information that I collect in 

99
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:59,280
my GPT. It's available to me here, and one of them happens to be the transcript. 

100
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:04,250
 will come over to our workflow. We've got the intro recap, content analysis, and 

101
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:08,810
it's the last video abridgement or transcript that we want. One of the things that's 

102
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:13,310
occurred to me as soon as I've done this is that I'm missing the title of the previous 

103
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:17,720
video, and that might actually be useful, but we'll keep this for now and let's come 

104
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,130
up with a quick little goal. 

105
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:22,990
I've just typed in the current video goal of show people how to write a script To 

106
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:28,960
recap the previous episode in the series. That's going to get merged in down here. 

107
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:34,390
All this information, we can just press the copy button, head over to A GPT, we'll 

108
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:36,430
just paste it, press enter. 

109
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:42,600
What we should start seeing is an analysis of what it believes the key themes are 

110
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,500
in the previous video and how to transition it into this video.

111
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:52,610
I've just taken a copy of the recap analysis. We'll come over to the recap intro 

112
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:58,760
script and we'll just paste that information in and press copy, come back to GPT. 

113
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:03,200
I've pasted all the information in and I've let it run. So we've got an intro script 

114
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:07,840
and GPT workflows. That did go on in the last video, but that wasn't the main thing 

115
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,980
I want to talk about here. What I wanna talk about is the reverse engineering of 

116
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:12,550
the Vid IQ, 

117
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,230
for the transition between videos. I also don't need the explanation, so I'm just 

118
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,760
putting in another pro.

119
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:22,220
In the last video, we explored how to reverse engineer the strategy for creating 

120
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:26,570
seamless transitions between videos. Based on insights from Vid IQ, 

121
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:31,650
we broke down the process Step-by-step using GPT workflows to automate those transitions 

122
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:36,720
and keep your audience engaged in this video. We'll take that step further by showing 

123
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:41,850
you how to write a compelling script that recaps your previous episode and perfectly 

124
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:43,380
sets up the next one.

125
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:49,260
There's another step in workflow automation for YouTubers, and I have dozens of these 

126
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:52,770
automations in place. And if you're interested in the software that I'm demonstrating, 

127
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:56,910
which is the agent workflow builder, then check out the link in the description. 

128
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:01,980
It's software that I'm developing and I'll make it available soon. I'm happy. AppyDave, 

129
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:06,240
please like and subscribe, and in the next video we're going to look at creating 

130
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,490
AI programming languages.
