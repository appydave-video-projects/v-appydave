I have two LLMs that I am testing.

1. GPT o1-preview (Strawberry)
2. GPT-4o

I created two prompts for two visual designs for each LLM.

Listed below is the LLM followed by the design name and the two prompts for each design.
I have also included a file prefix that can help you associate with the files listed bellow.

I want you to create a HTML/Javascript slide show
Each slide represents a unique LLM, Design Name, Prompt Content composite key

Every slide should have the following:

1. The LLM name using H1
2. The design name using H2
3. Prompt Content using paragraph
4. Display four images for using the file prefix plus image number from 1 to 4.

Here are my brand colors:
primary-dark #342d2d
primary-light #ccba9d
highlight #ffde59
You can also use white or black if neeeded.

I should be able to press the left/right button to navigate between the slides.

Here is the information about LLMs, Designs, Prompts and file prefixes:

LLM: GPT o1-preview (Strawberry)

Design 1: Visual Drag-and-Drop Workflow Editor

Prompt 1:
A modern web interface showcasing an intuitive visual drag-and-drop workflow editor. On a clean, minimalist canvas, colorful nodes represent workflow steps like actions, decisions, inputs, and outputs. These nodes are connected by smooth arrows indicating the flow of a complex process. A sidebar on the left displays a palette of categorized nodes with icons and labels, ready for dragging onto the canvas. When a node is selected, a properties panel appears on the right with editable fields. The interface includes a toolbar with common actions like save, undo, redo, and zoom controls. The design emphasizes usability with clear typography, simple color schemes, and smooth animations during interactions.

Prompt 2:
A screenshot of a web application featuring a node-based workflow canvas where users build workflows by dragging and dropping nodes. The large workspace displays a complex network of color-coded nodes connected by lines and arrows, illustrating the workflow paths including conditional branches and loops. A sidebar component palette on the left allows users to search and select nodes grouped by type. Hovering over components reveals tooltips with brief descriptions. The top toolbar includes icons for saving, undoing actions, and simulating workflow execution. The overall design is sleek and minimalist, with intuitive icons, consistent UI elements, and an emphasis on accessibility and responsive interactions.

Design 2: Reusable Templates and Component Libraries

Prompt 1:
A web application interface displaying a template gallery for workflows. The screen features a grid of thumbnail previews of pre-built workflow templates, each categorized under headings like Content Generation and Data Processing. A search bar at the top enables users to quickly find templates by keyword. Each template thumbnail includes action buttons such as "Use Template" and "Preview," along with brief descriptions. The design maintains visual consistency with the workflow editor, using a professional and modern color scheme, clear labels, and simple, intuitive icons. The interface is clean, with ample whitespace and organized layout, enhancing ease of navigation.

Prompt 2:
An interface of a workflow editor web application showcasing a component library sidebar on the right. The sidebar displays a list of reusable nodes and component groups from personal and shared libraries, each with metadata like name, description, and thumbnail images. Users can drag and drop these components onto the main canvas to build or modify workflows. The main canvas shows a partially constructed workflow with connected nodes. Action buttons like "Save Component" and "Share" are present near the components. The design features clear typography, consistent iconography, and a cohesive color palette that aligns with the overall branding. The interface emphasizes user-friendly navigation and clarity, aiding users in efficiently building workflows.

LLM: GPT-4o

Design 1: Visual Drag-and-Drop Workflow Editor

Prompt 1:
"Design an intuitive, modern drag-and-drop interface for an AI-driven workflow editor. The editor should feature a clean, spacious canvas with zoom and pan functionality, where users can drag workflow components from a categorized sidebar. Represent components as color-coded nodes, including decision points, action steps, and start/end points, with clear lines or arrows connecting them. Include a node configuration panel on the right that shows editable fields like inputs, outputs, and prompt settings. The interface should have smooth animations, feedback during node connections, and a minimalist toolbar with actions like Save, Undo, and Redo. Visualize real-time status with color-coded progress bars and execution tracking on the canvas."
file prefix: gpt-4o-design-1-prompt-1

Prompt 2:
"Create a UI design for a node-based workflow editor that supports human-in-the-loop AI workflows. The main canvas should have draggable nodes representing steps in a workflow, with vibrant colors differentiating nodes like decisions, actions, and loops. Incorporate connectors between nodes to define data flow, with animated transitions when nodes are repositioned. Include a sidebar component palette with tooltips and search functionality for finding nodes. On the right, display a node configuration panel where users can edit attributes like node names, descriptions, and associated prompts. The overall design should feel interactive, modern, and user-friendly, with clear visual feedback for errors or incomplete connections."
file prefix: gpt-4o-design-1-prompt-2

Design 2: Reusable Templates and Component Libraries

Prompt 1:
"Design a sleek template gallery for a workflow builder interface that features pre-built templates and reusable components. The gallery should have a sidebar with categorized sections such as 'Content Generation' and 'Data Processing', where users can browse or search for templates. Display templates as thumbnail cards with brief descriptions and action buttons like 'Preview' and 'Use Template'. In the library, include both personal and shared components, with an option for users to save and share custom nodes. Show drag-and-drop functionality, where users can import templates or components directly into a workflow canvas. The UI should be clean and modern, with clear visual hierarchies and smooth animations."
file prefix: gpt-4o-design-2-prompt-1

Prompt 2:
"Illustrate a reusable component library for a workflow builder web application. Show a sidebar where users can access a collection of pre-built workflow components, categorized by type (e.g., actions, decisions, inputs). Each component is represented by a thumbnail with a description and metadata like creation date and last modified. Include a feature where users can drag components from the library directly onto the workflow canvas. Visualize the ability to save custom components, with options for version control and sharing with team members. The interface should feel streamlined and professional, with clear labeling, intuitive icons, and consistent design across the workflow editor and library sections."
