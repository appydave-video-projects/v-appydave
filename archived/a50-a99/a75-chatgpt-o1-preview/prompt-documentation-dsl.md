# Action Plan for Implementing a DSL for Requirements Document System

## Description
This action plan outlines the steps to build a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for a requirements document system. The goal is to integrate the DSL into **VS Code** and a **browser-based editor** (Monaco Editor) while allowing the DSL to output a **JSON representation** of the document structure in real-time.

## Goal
To implement a DSL that users can interact with via VS Code or an online editor, providing real-time feedback in the form of JSON output. The project will include features like syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and linting.

---

### 1. **Project Setup**
- **Objective**: Set up a **TypeScript** project to implement the DSL and integrate it with VS Code and Monaco Editor.
- **Guidance**: Create the project structure using TypeScript, install dependencies like LSP libraries, and configure the necessary development environment.

---

### 2. **Language Grammar Definition**
- **Objective**: Define the syntax and grammar for the DSL based on the Ruby-inspired structure.
- **Guidance**: Write the grammar rules for syntax highlighting, tokenization, and parsing of the DSL in both VS Code and Monaco Editor.

---

### 3. **Language Server (LSP) Implementation**
- **Objective**: Implement the **Language Server Protocol (LSP)** for handling DSL parsing, AST generation, linting, and error checking.
- **Guidance**: Implement features like auto-completion, error checking, and document formatting within the LSP.

---

### 4. **DSL Parsing and JSON Conversion**
- **Objective**: Convert the DSL input into an **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)** and then into **JSON** that reflects the document structure.
- **Guidance**: Implement logic to convert the parsed DSL into a structured JSON format. This should align with the provided folder hierarchy and expected output.

---

### 5. **VS Code and Monaco Editor Integration**
- **Objective**: Integrate the DSL into **VS Code** (as an extension) and **Monaco Editor** for browser-based editing.
- **Guidance**: Ensure features like syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and live JSON preview are available in both environments. 

---

### 6. **Real-time JSON Output**
- **Objective**: Display the JSON output of the DSL in real time as the user types the DSL commands in the editor.
- **Guidance**: Implement a real-time JSON preview that reflects the structure of the DSL input in a secondary window or panel.
