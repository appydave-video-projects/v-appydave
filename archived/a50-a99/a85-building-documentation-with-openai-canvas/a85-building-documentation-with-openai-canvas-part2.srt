1
00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:04,690
Now I've just had a little bit of a look through the documentation. Everything looks 

2
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:08,770
good. So what we should do now is publish it and make it available for a project. 

3
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:12,790
So what I'm going to do is just click on the copy button, and where I want it to 

4
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:18,800
go is into the handlebars project. Now this project is two years old and it hasn't 

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,910
had a change since about a year ago. It had a minor change. And if we look at the 

6
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:27,140
current usage documentation, it's not available. So this is what we're going to change. 

7
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:32,340
So let's head over to Cursor. And what I've done is I've just changed the path of 

8
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:37,320
the documentation and created a new empty file. And we should be able to paste all 

9
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,990
of that in. Let's just do one little check to see that visually it looks okay. Things 

10
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:44,880
seem to be coming through okay.

11
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:49,870
I'd like to just publish this up to a Ruby gem repository. So what we're doing at 

12
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:55,720
the moment is just merging the changes into the repo. It's going to update the semantic 

13
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:00,760
version number. Hopefully we're going to go from 13.1. I believe it currently is 

14
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:05,840
to version 14. That's also going to bring it into alignment with the other project 

15
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:11,750
that we just did, the cmdlets, which are currently on 14 as well. So once this in 

16
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:16,900
place, we should then be able to use the documentation in the next project that we're 

17
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:17,900
going to be working on.

18
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:23,230
Now the CI pipeline just finished. Let's check out what it's done. So currently we're 

19
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:32,560
on version 0.13.1. If we refresh this we move up to 0.14.0. For the documentation. 

20
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:38,200
There's the old documentation. Let's update it. And I did get a misspell here. But 

21
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:43,960
essentially all of the documentation has now come into place. Let's have a look at 

22
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:49,960
the Ruby gems. So currently the Ruby gems should show Commandlet on 14 and handlebars 

23
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:55,750
on 13.1. But if we refresh that, that has now moved to 14 zero. So both of these 

24
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,400
are in alignment as well.

25
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:02,210
Now, with our documentation created, let's check out how we could use it in an AI 

26
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,380
pair programmer. 

27
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:09,580
I've come over to the Cursor AI IDE, and there's a brand new project that I've started 

28
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:15,250
called k_template. It's an embedded web server that uses handlebars templates to 

29
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,810
render information. 

30
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:21,590
what I've just quickly done is come through. We've got some dependencies here. We 

31
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:26,720
should change them to 14 because this is what the gems are going to be. And lastly 

32
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,640
we need to go and check the settings within Cursor. So at the moment we're on general, 

33
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:37,670
if you head over to a concept called features, you can scroll down and add documentation 

34
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:44,480
into the system. So we'll click on Add Docs and I'm just going to paste in the information. 

35
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,460
I've changed the letters usage. So that should be okay. Now we'll press enter on 

36
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:56,750
that. And it's now starting to add handlebars JS. We'll press confirm on that. And 

37
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:03,980
currently it's indexing. So what I'll do is I'll take us over to cmdlet as well. 

38
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:09,830
And we'll come back to Cursor. We'll add docs. The last one has finished. So we can 

39
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:14,450
now add in cmdlet. It's probably going to ask the same question. We'll press confirm 

40
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:18,370
and now it's starting to index that documentation as well.

41
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,710
Let's just do a quick progress report. In this video, we've rapidly created documentation 

42
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:29,470
using GPT canvas. In the last video, we did the same thing, but we used Cursor AI 

43
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:34,600
to create the documentation. In the next video, we're going to bring together both 

44
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:39,820
pieces of documentation to rapidly create a web application that uses handlebars. 

45
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:43,870
