00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:04,960
If you've ever used an AI assistant like Claude or ChatGPT, then you've had to learn 

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,900
a little bit about prompt engineering. Now, either you're writing your own prompts, 

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:13,310
maybe you've bought one out of a template pack, maybe you've gone quite advanced 

4
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:15,260
and you're creating your own custom GPT 

5
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:20,560
so that you have this reusable conversation that you can start off with new information.

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,320
I am writing prompts and using custom GPT on a daily basis. But one of the things 

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:31,140
that happens more and more is that I have these repeatable sets of GPT or agents 

8
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:36,210
that I wanna run to solve specific business problems. And in this video, I want to 

9
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,620
continue the proof of concept application that I talked about in the last video, 

10
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:45,540
and we'll turn it into a minimum viable product, something that you could use to 

11
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,850
solve your own GPT workflows.

12
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:52,720
In the last video, I talked about a proof of concept application that I'd put together 

13
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:58,960
for my own use called GPT Agent Workflow. And the idea is that you would come up 

14
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,910
with these workflows. Like here it's the YouTube script writer workflow. There'd 

15
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:09,130
be a research phase, and you'd go from the basic idea. You would select an idea from 

16
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:13,930
that. You'd develop some facts or details about the YouTube script that you wanna 

17
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:18,250
write that could come up with some video ideas. And then you would select the 

18
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:21,770
so on. And that would be part of the research phase. And after that, you would go 

19
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:25,310
into a new phase, and that would be the developed script phase. 

20
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:29,380
you can see them up here on the left. So if we click on the research and development, 

21
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:34,330
you can see the workflow and that there's this idea that you go from left to right 

22
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:39,310
from this idea to this one. Currently we're on the basic fact sheet, and as you get 

23
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:44,530
to the last step, you would then move on to the next phase, which would be developing 

24
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:49,270
the script. Now, the problem with this particular application is it doesn't work 

25
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:54,400
if you click here, nothing actually happens because this was a proof of concept. 

26
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,860
What I was really trying to do here is figure out, 

27
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:01,640
what would happen if I had this prompt and we'll put a little variable called Idea. 

28
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:02,200
if I said, 

29
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:07,740
let's do a cool idea goes here. What would be nice is if I could go and click on 

30
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:13,650
a button somewhere like Copy Workflow and put it straight into ChatGPT or whatever 

31
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,180
AI assistant I'm using, 

32
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,00
or maybe click the little start button down here to have it run the prompt for me.

33
00:02:20,00 --> 00:02:25,600
So with the proof of concept now demonstrating how I see an agent workflow tool working, 

34
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:30,700
let's move into the minimum viable product. And what we'll do is we'll just click 

35
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:35,350
back to the overview and this is what we've currently got for this particular workflow. 

36
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,550
And I'm just gonna change the URLA little bit on my system and you'll see that it 

37
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:46,780
changes ever so slightly. So what we've got now is a agent workflow tool written 

38
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,860
a little bit differently to the old one, and when we click on things, they actually 

39
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:56,950
work. So we can now go from idea to idea. We can come down to the little arrows here 

40
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:01,480
and as we get to the last one, it should say, let's move on to the next 

41
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,630
phase. And that would be the developed script phase.

42
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:08,570
Now the good thing about the minimum viable product is it's configured exactly the 

43
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:13,790
same way as the proof of concept. So what we can do here is we'll go and select the 

44
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:19,610
selected idea, cool ideas, go here. Notice that at the moment it's on three and you 

45
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:23,930
can't click on anything. Nothing actually works in this particular variation of the 

46
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:29,900
tool, but we move to the new version and we can go and click on the basic fact sheet. 

47
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:35,220
and there's this interpolated variable that we can put in called idea. Now I know 

48
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:40,260
that this selected idea and this don't match, so I'm just gonna call this selected 

49
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,430
idea right there. 

50
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:47,620
what'll happen is if I paste in a value here, it should appear here, and we put it 

51
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:47,890
in. 

52
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:53,960
If we want it in another part of the prompt, we can just paste it in like that and 

53
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:55,580
it just gets replaced 

54
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,590
and the good thing is 

55
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:01,620
There's a copy button here that when we click on it, we'll see this little copied 

56
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,990
to clipboard, it's ready for me to use. 

57
00:04:04,00 --> 00:04:08,350
in the final product, I'd like to have a start button, and in this case it called 

58
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:12,880
Claude. Or we could have it send it to two different large language models at the 

59
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:18,820
same time, or just choose large language models based on the particular step that 

60
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:19,540
you're on. 

61
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,520
pop up the GPT window, we'll 

62
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:26,470
we'll just paste everything in. So what it's got is I need you to gather detailed 

63
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:32,320
and reliable information about, the cool idea goes here. So if we just pop into this 

64
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,860
view and we've got cool idea again, and we'll just let it run. 

65
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:40,180
from the prompt template and a couple of variables, you should be able to get your 

66
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:45,160
detailed prompt, ready to go paste it into your large language model, and it goes 

67
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,570
and does its thing. The next step from that is that whatever the output is that we're 

68
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:54,520
seeing coming through right now becomes the input for the next step in the workflow.

69
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:59,860
I am calling this tool agent Workflow Builder, and I'm developing it and demonstrating 

70
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:04,450
it as I go. Now, if you want access to some of the code, which will be open source, 

71
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:10,930
or if you're more interested in using this as a SaaS application, then click on the 

72
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:11,110
link in the description.

73
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:15,480
Now the way I'm building this application is with a technique that I call flow code. 

74
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:20,880
So if you've heard of no code application generators, they're usually user interfaces. 

75
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,800
You drag and drop and it produces code. For me, flow code just stands for a freaking 

76
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:32,250
lot of code and it's taking small inputs and creating working sets of code that solve 

77
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:32,490
problems.

78
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,740
So when I first started writing this application, this is where I started. It was 

79
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:42,140
just a simple mind map around a workflow that I'd been doing every time I did a video 

80
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:47,870
and I took a copy of that workflow and I just dropped it into chat GPT. I said, can 

81
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,820
you read this information 

82
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:53,250
Now I've just done a refresh on that window. And what you'll see is that it's quite 

83
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:59,580
a long conversation. It went for a couple of days, usually just talking to the phone 

84
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:04,320
to build things. But some of the stuff that it came up with was entity relationship 

85
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:10,620
diagrams for different workflows. I was also testing concepts like data flow diagrams. 

86
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:15,690
And what this allowed me to do was develop a schema. I was able to work through the 

87
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:20,130
key components that I wanted in the application. So with that in place, I was able 

88
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,950
to start a new application using Astro here, and I then developed a bunch of the 

89
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:31,680
key components like the workflow, the prompts, the settings, et cetera. And I was 

90
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,690
able to do this by just talking to the ChatGPT window here on 

91
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:39,600
developing some data models in TypeScript. 

92
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:46,210
Next, I use Tailwind CSS. I'm, I don't consider myself a good JavaScript or Tailwind 

93
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:52,240
CSS sort of developer, but the great thing about ChatGPT is that it can do all the 

94
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,980
coding for you so long as you know how to prompt it. And that's a lot of what this 

95
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:02,320
video series is about, is just talking about how I solve problems as a programmer 

96
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:07,660
who may not actually be a polyglot in the different languages that I want to use.

97
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:11,950
Now a lot of the information you just saw was about building the proof of concept 

98
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:17,320
application in Astro with Tailwind CSS. But then I wanted to make it a little bit 

99
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,480
dynamic and that requires getting into client side JavaScript. Now, my first approach 

100
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:28,810
was to have conversation with GPT about integrating Alpine js. And it was working 

101
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:33,910
a little bit, but it was getting a bit bogged down and I thought, well, maybe I need 

102
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:40,840
to use a proper client side framework. So I decided to use felt, and the minimum 

103
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:46,150
viable product that you're about to look at was written by converting the Astro components 

104
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:48,460
to Swet components.

105
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:52,410
I am not going to go into detail on how I'm writing the application in this video. 

106
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:56,790
If that's a video you wanna see, let me know in the comments below. But we're back 

107
00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:02,280
here at now, the minimum viable product, and we're going to put it through its paces 

108
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,890
by developing a workflow today.

109
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:09,900
So let's quickly demonstrate a real world example. So here I've got a channel called 

110
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:15,390
AI TLDR. It's about two and a half months old and I've created 30 videos. And one 

111
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:21,690
of the videos recently was, is Flex one a better alternative to mid journey? 

112
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:26,910
So here's part of the workflow that I use for the AI TLDR channel, and we're in the 

113
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:32,670
research and development phase and I've got create five simple project ideas for 

114
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:36,480
an idea. And the idea happens to be flu one versus Midjourney. 

115
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:36,610
if 

116
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:43,390
And if I head over to chat GPT and paste it in, we come up with a list of potential 

117
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:48,280
project ideas for the video and I can copy them in and head over to the next step 

118
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:51,250
where I've just pasted it into the ideas. 

119
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:56,530
one of the future things that I wanna do with this tool is have the ability to select 

120
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:58,300
an idea, but at the moment, that's not there. 

121
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:03,780
I've put in the idea I wanna work with Art Generation Flux One versus midjourney. 

122
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:09,420
I can click copy on this to get the prompt and then just head over to any AI assistant 

123
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:13,680
that you are using, paste it in, and you'll get a whole lot of information. From 

124
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,320
there, I've just copied all the information that you see. 

125
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:21,260
Moved over to the next tab where I wanna get some video ideas and I've pasted in 

126
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:26,720
the original idea and we've also got the fact sheet that we've just developed. 

127
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:29,960
I can click the copy, get the new prompt, 

128
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,900
I want to do a YouTube video 

129
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:33,680
Flux versus Midjourney. And 

130
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:38,500
we've got the basic fact sheet. And down below we've got a bunch of video ideas that 

131
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:43,270
we can work with. So I tend to then select that information head back to the GPT 

132
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:47,650
workflow. And we're on the expanded fat sheet where we've got the original idea, 

133
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:53,500
we've got the basic fat sheet that we developed, and now we've got a video idea that 

134
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,560
I selected that I wanna do information on. From there, 

135
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,480
I can build out an extended fat sheet 

136
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:02,830
that we're looking at right here. So all the information, background information 

137
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:07,720
about the company, how users are using it, is it fast? What's, what's its pricing 

138
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:13,150
model. I've got every piece of information that I might need for either the YouTube 

139
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:17,470
video, which is what I used it for, but you could also use it for an article if that 

140
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:18,420
was what you were developing.

141
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:22,940
I've just shown you how I use agent workflows to create a YouTube script. But what 

142
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:26,960
if we want to come up with a new workflow altogether? Well, the good thing is I've 

143
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:33,410
created a workflow called Agent Workflow Architect, and the idea is that you want 

144
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:37,880
a workflow objective. What are you trying to achieve? What are the steps that would 

145
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:42,620
be involved in achieving that target? Can they be organized? Are there groups of 

146
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:46,340
steps that you wanna do? Let's come up with a cool name. The name in this particular 

147
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:51,860
case is Agent Workflow Architect, and then develop a specification. There's future 

148
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,690
phases that are coming along 

149
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:54,440
the example, 

150
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:57,670
workflow for publishing a video on YouTube. 

151
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:02,480
this is my main channel, and here the steps that I need to do is I need to come up 

152
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:07,130
with a thumbnail. There's the text that I wanna put on the thumbnail and the title 

153
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:09,890
that I want to have for the YouTube video. 

154
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:14,230
if we look at this particular video pong to Pacman, when I uploaded it, I had the 

155
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:20,500
transcript, but what I then needed to do was create a whole lot of extra information 

156
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,330
in the YouTube description. 

157
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:27,420
so here we've got the overview of what the video is all about. We've got a little 

158
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:33,270
bit of a call to action to buy me a coffee. We've got a headline going on. After 

159
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:38,370
that, we've got the chapters of the video. From there, there's some branding information 

160
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:43,650
about myself, social media accounts that you can go to, useful affiliate links. And 

161
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:47,100
then we've got the visualization of the chapters that we just looked at. 

162
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:53,200
There'll be a bunch of tweets that I produce and also a bunch of LinkedIn articles 

163
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,940
and Facebook posts. So let's head back to the agent Workflow Architect. We'll click 

164
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:03,430
on the objective and we'll put in an idea. And the first one will be YouTube Video 

165
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:04,890
publisher. That's basically what 

166
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:09,330
I'm also going to paste in a goal here and we can see that come down the bottom. 

167
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:11,230
I don't bother to clean up the text. 

168
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:16,240
if there's mistakes in it, that's okay. But basically I'm asking a set of agents 

169
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,710
that will automate various aspects of the YouTube video release. When I currently 

170
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:25,270
release a video, I have to come up with title and text on the thumbnail. Then I need 

171
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:29,740
to create a YouTube description, and that's usually got chapters and brand information. 

172
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,460
finally, I need to publish to LinkedIn and Twitter, et cetera. 

173
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:37,560
I've put that information in, and from there we can just copy the button 

174
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:43,230
head over to a new ChatGPT window or whatever AI assistant you are using. 

175
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:44,680
we're passing this information in. 

176
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:50,570
So we move on from the workflow objective to the list of steps. We've got an agent 

177
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:54,950
objective, which we just got from the previous ChatGPT window. We'll paste that in. 

178
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:56,660
We'll click on the copy button 

179
00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:01,240
and then we could paste it directly in. But what I'll do is I'll just start a new 

180
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:06,520
ChatGPT window and I'll paste it here, because generally when I'm doing my individual 

181
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:12,730
prompts, they have a enough context in them to do whatever's needed to be done. You 

182
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:15,130
don't need to flow on from a previous conversation. 

183
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:16,570
We're on organized steps. 

184
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:21,170
I'm just gonna paste the information into the list step here. One of the things you 

185
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:25,340
might've noticed is that I've got this bar down the bottom saying language model, 

186
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:29,300
where you can select various language models that you might wanna send the prompt 

187
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,120
to, and a start button. 

188
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:33,340
that's coming in a future version of the software. 

189
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,350
it's come up with a workflow that thinks that there should be a content planning 

190
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:42,660
and creation phase with a bunch of steps going on. There would be the review and 

191
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:46,500
optimization, and then finally the publishing and distribution. 

192
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:50,350
I had a go at this yesterday, so I'm going to use some different information that 

193
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:55,210
I've manually modified. So we can see the list here, which it came up with yesterday. 

194
00:13:55,210 --> 00:14:00,430
It was pretty accurate. But I went through and I manually modified a couple of areas 

195
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:05,120
I tend to create a summary from the transcript, then I'll create an abridgement, 

196
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,890
which is a different type of summary. After that, I want to get some metadata, like 

197
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,750
potential topics, keywords. 

198
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,110
we can 

199
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:17,700
get a good title, get a thumbnail text, get optimized text, and then finally we create 

200
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,380
the YouTube description 

201
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,910
tweet, Facebook post, and LinkedIn. 

202
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:23,660
it then developed a 

203
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:27,780
grouping for me. That's the way it initially looked, but I went and modified it a 

204
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:28,590
little 

205
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:32,910
so that I could have additional information. So our final one is going to look like 

206
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:40,110
video analysis and preparation title and thumbnail optimization and video and social 

207
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,160
media creation. 

208
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:46,130
head back over to our workflow, we'll move on to the organized list, and I'm just 

209
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:52,430
copying that information in. From here, we can take a copy and let's get some potential 

210
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:53,690
names for the workflow. 

211
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:59,240
I could open up a new chat GPT window for today. We'll test it by just using the 

212
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:02,90
current conversation. That should also work well. 

213
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:07,670
We've got a list of potential names here. I generated a new one. Anytime I need more, 

214
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:12,110
I can just press refresh from here. And these sort of capabilities I would like to 

215
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:17,60
build into the tool. The one I ultimately went with, which was from yesterday, was 

216
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,800
video launch optimizer. 

217
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:22,600
we're over at the specification. I'm just gonna put in the name I like. We've got 

218
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,700
our organized list going on here. 

219
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:30,700
we'll copy it and create a detailed specification of the different phases of the 

220
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:34,990
workflow, the different steps within the workflow, and what the input and the output 

221
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:37,480
parameters will be. So we'll just kick it off 

222
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:42,950
There's a structured shape that I'd like the output to be in, and we're getting all 

223
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,450
the information ready. 

224
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:48,360
As you look through it, we've got different phases, video preparation, title, and 

225
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:53,140
thumbnail content creation. We've got different steps like summarizing, abridgement, 

226
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,210
analyzing, and adding the metadata. 

227
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:59,910
a description going on, and then it starts building out what it thinks the input 

228
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:05,430
and the output parameters should be. So the transcript would be an obvious input. 

229
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:06,630
And what 

230
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:10,860
We get a video summary. The transcript and the video summary might be an input. Now 

231
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:16,140
this is not correct. I would manually modify this and we would get a video abridgement, 

232
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:21,60
because I see the summary and the abridgement as similar, but different pieces of 

233
00:16:21,60 --> 00:16:22,620
information that I want to capture. 

234
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:28,470
So now I have a detailed specification of what the workflow should have and chat 

235
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:33,930
GPT has come up with what parameters it thinks I need, but I'm gonna go through it 

236
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:39,420
and manually change 'em. The main parameter I use all the time with my video workflows 

237
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:44,100
is the transcript. Whatever I said in the video is what I want to use as a source 

238
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,390
of truth. From that, 

239
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:50,700
I want to get keywords After. After I've got these bits of information, then I can 

240
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:55,680
go and generate titles and content using this extra information. So last thing we'll 

241
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:00,870
do is we'll take it and let's turn it into a user interface where we can enter this 

242
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,280
information ourselves.

243
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:07,600
the first five steps that we've done being around the agent workflow design are here 

244
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:12,910
and we're on the last step and we can go down. Now I also have this concept of output 

245
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:18,550
attributes. So anything here is where when the GPT is are being run and you're getting 

246
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:23,800
information, it goes into these variable names. So hopefully we're gonna have a specification 

247
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:28,840
filled in with the table we just created, and that'll happen when we go over to the 

248
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:34,960
create DSL. But we can do that by pressing this down arrow. That takes us to the 

249
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,890
next phase. And we've got our phase, it says generate DSL. We've got the original 

250
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:43,270
name of the workflow that we wanna work with. We've got a list of the organized steps, 

251
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:48,160
and we've got this table. If we open it up, we can see the table all listed here. 

252
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:53,770
From that, we can just click on the copy button, head over to a new GPT window, and 

253
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:58,990
we'll just paste everything in. And what this is doing is producing a programming 

254
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:00,400
language that I created. 

255
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:06,770
His only job is to recreate workflows. When we run this, we'll get a visualization 

256
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:10,130
very similar to the screens that we're looking at here. 

257
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,870
we'll let that finish. It's still going at the moment, 

258
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,400
and we'll just press copy on it.

259
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:20,820
I've just pasted the workflow in here, and you can think of it as GPT agent workflows 

260
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,610
as code and as code. We can see that we've got an agent creation. What are we creating? 

261
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:31,920
It's the YouTube Launch Optimizer. I did change it from video to YouTube. There's 

262
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:38,430
a description going on. It's got a place where the prompts are going to be stored, 

263
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:42,360
and what default large language model do you want to use? I want to use, 

264
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:47,430
ChatGPT 4o. Then the prompts are all listed here. This is where it will find them. 

265
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:52,530
The attributes that we're being defining are all listed, and then there are three 

266
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:57,930
phases. Phase one is the video preparation, where to summarize the video, we take 

267
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:03,570
the transcript, we use the video summary prompt, and we produce the video summary. 

268
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,260
And this is just repeating over and over for each phase. 

269
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:12,780
when I hit save, it'll automatically create a user interface for me. Currently, it 

270
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:18,810
says GPT Workflows. YouTube Launch Optimizer is not found, but the moment I hit save, 

271
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:24,210
it becomes available. And here we have video preparation. We've summarized Abridgement 

272
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:26,760
video analysis and add the metadata. 

273
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:32,860
the good thing is because I use Chat GPT to create all of these workflow steps, it 

274
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:36,700
only takes a couple of minutes to create this complex user interface 

275
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:44,320
using the GPT workflow as code, as an intermediary system. Now, in the future, I 

276
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:48,640
won't do it that way. I'll build this into a SaaS application where it'll be a little 

277
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,400
bit more streamlined, but this is how I'm doing it today.

278
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:55,980
So now that the workflow is created, we could use it today, but the video that you're 

279
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,750
watching, I'm going to edit it 

280
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,460
With that transcript, I'll be coming through to this workflow and I'll be typing 

281
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:06,380
it into this location. As for the prompts, now, I've already done some videos at 

282
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:12,470
the beginning of the year called Seven GPTs to Grow Your Channel in 2024, and the 

283
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:17,960
transcript summary that we talk about here is dealt with in that particular video. 

284
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:24,260
There's also a video here called SEO, GPT Boosted, SEO for YouTube description. So 

285
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:28,550
this is where I'm going to get the prompt for the YouTube description. I've got one 

286
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:32,390
for the LinkedIn, I've got one for the Twitter, and I've got a few others that I'll 

287
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:32,870
add in. 

288
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:38,630
I will talk about how the agent workflow is code or the DSL actually works behind 

289
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:43,520
the scenes. And we'll have a look at the script from this video in the next video 

290
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:48,770
as it produces the YouTube description and the LinkedIn post and the tweets. 

291
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:53,820
I'm AppyDave like to subscribe. If this is something that you want to keep following, 

292
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:57,750
I've got a link in the description. If you wanna find out more about the project, 

293
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:02,700
either from the SaaS application that I'll be launching sometime in the future or 

294
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:07,380
from the open source code that you might want to use if you want to add to or extend 

295
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,610
this particular project.

296
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:10,500
I look forward to seeing you in the next video.
