00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,970
Aider is an AI pair programmer that you can use through automation. And this week

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:10,470
I've been experimenting with it, and I thought I'd extend the presentation system

3
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:15,990
that we did in the previous video and try the image to code generation technique

4
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:20,520
and see if I can create some templates. I'm AppyDave. Please like and subscribe and

5
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,510
let's get into it.

6
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:26,870
So here we have the Canva template. And when we put it into Aider using the image

7
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:32,120
to CSS, this is what we got for our template system. When we looked at the second

8
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:37,370
template in the system, which looks great in Canva, it didn't look quite so good

9
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,610
once the image to CSS had been done.

10
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:45,550
third template that you can see here looks really good, just with a slightly different

11
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:46,300
layout.

12
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:52,330
So in the last video we created this presentation on Reveal.js. The infographics

13
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:56,500
were designed using napkin I. There is a link in the description, but all the code

14
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:01,930
was done using a single prompt, using a requirements to code technique that I use.

15
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:06,420
was all done with Aider AI Now if you want access to the code, you can come over

16
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,310
to the AppyDave repository. It's an organization and we've got Aider presentation

17
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:16,860
tool available. But what I thought we'd do today is improve the styling of the presentation.

18
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:22,560
And what I've done is come over to Canva and I've just picked an off the shelf presentation

19
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,660
template, and then I've restyled it a little bit just using my brand guidelines.

20
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:33,600
So let's see if we can convert these images into styling on Reveal.js presentations.

21
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:39,700
I've opened up the Aider AI documentation, and I've found this link images and web

22
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:43,990
pages. And the two that I think we're going to work with today will be the add by

23
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:46,480
file name or add by pasting.

24
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:51,750
Now let's go over to Visual Studio. And this is the project we developed a couple

25
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,490
of things to be aware of. There is an assets folder where we were putting the Scalable

26
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,290
Vector Graphics. There's a data folder which is where the slide deck is. And I've

27
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:06,660
just added a docs folder. Within that we've got the requirements document from the

28
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:11,250
last video. But we now have a list of images. So if we'll just click on a couple

29
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:11,700
of them

30
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,270
can see different mocks that I would like to turn into CSS.

31
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:19,630
Now I just wanna make a minor change before we add images. What I think we'll do

32
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:24,580
is we'll go over to the CSS area right here. And I'm just gonna put in a comment.

33
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:29,350
And the comment is just some named variables that I would like to,

34
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,940
utilize in the CSS. And what we can do from there is pop on over to the terminal

35
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,440
where I'm running the,

36
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:41,500
browser at the moment, or the reveal JS website. We'll open up a new terminal git

37
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:45,640
status, we've got a modification type in Aider. This will connect to Aider and we'll

38
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:52,720
be using the sonnet, 3.5 model at the moment. And what I'd like to do is say, I would

39
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,410
like

40
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,950
to use CSS variables,

41
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,220
CSS custom.

42
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:01,150
It asks if we want to add this into the chat window. The CSS file,

43
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:06,590
we're saying yes, and it starts rendering information for us. Now we can see here

44
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,780
that we've got variables coming through.

45
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,150
We've got these brand variables, and it looks like we've got some semantic naming

46
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:16,330
variables going on as well. So we'll just,

47
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,250
let's test it. Just check that it's all working.

48
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:23,310
So I've got the original website there. I'm just going to change this to Red so that

49
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:27,990
we see it for sure and press refresh. And there we have AppyDave

50
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:32,560
image and there we have it. AppyDave channels, images generated using napkin. Let's

51
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,600
just undo that for a second and refresh. And we're looking good.

52
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:42,190
Now I want to start by looking at the slides and the data that goes onto the slides.

53
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:47,830
So I've just put together this simple structure and there's three different concepts

54
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:52,360
that I'm trying to deal with here. The first is that you might have data points with

55
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:57,880
semantic meaning like main heading or subheading. The next is that you have data

56
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:04,600
points that map quite cleanly to HTML elements. And then the third one is just talking

57
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:11,230
about positioning top left right bottom images, in this case provided as Scalable

58
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:16,450
Vector graphics. Now the next thing I want to do and this is where we'll use Aider

59
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:21,730
is I want to add three more templates. And these are the look and feels that I want

60
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,810
to work with.

61
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:28,250
Now I'd like to use Aider to extract the data that's in these images and add it to

62
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:33,170
the templates here. So we've got template one, two, and three. They actually represent

63
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:38,270
slides. This is more the template definition and I want to create template four,

64
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:44,780
five, and six as data and slides. So what we'll do is we'll come down to Aider and

65
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:52,820
how about we say, can you add a new slide to, and what we need to do is put in the

66
00:04:52,820 --> 00:05:00,980
file name, it's the JSON New, can you add a new slide to slides new? Call it template

67
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:09,960
four. And use this image to find the data. And we'll just put in one and there's

68
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,640
the image that we want

69
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,200
and we'll press yes.

70
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:18,860
So it started adding the concept of a template four. And let's see what it's done

71
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:24,950
here. We've got template four, social media strategy, and okay, this looks good.

72
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:31,430
Now I'm not sure whether I wanted to do that as two fields or one that wraps, but

73
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,170
I think we'll leave it at that for now.

74
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,270
We'll try. With the second image. We'll say, can you add a new slide to template

75
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:44,530
five using Slide New and use two dot jpeg?

76
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:50,300
we'll say yes. And hopefully what'll happen is we'll see today's presentation main

77
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:57,560
topic and then a bullet list. And all of this is meant to go in here. So there's

78
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:03,380
all the information. It's come through. We've got this image being referenced which

79
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,740
well we'll leave that there the way it is.

80
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:11,410
And here we are on to template number six which is using our third image. We'll let

81
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:16,330
that go through and see what happens. Now this is obviously not the image I want

82
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:21,490
to use, but there was an image on the page. So the fact that it found that is also

83
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:26,440
pretty handy. So if we look at this, we've got a name and a title that's looking

84
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:31,450
good. We've got position and description based as roles and then we've got an image

85
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:38,290
again. So Aider is excellent at reading the images just to capture the data. And

86
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:43,390
it's formatted it into the JSON document just following the patterns that we've used

87
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,320
before.

88
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:50,630
Now we've got our updated slide definition file. There's six different slides all

89
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:56,810
using a unique template. And you can see an image down below of the last presentation

90
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:00,620
we did. Now that used a different structure. And this is the structure here. We've

91
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:05,510
got a H1 and H2. And then we've got this scalable vector graphic going on at the

92
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:10,790
bottom. There's other slides going on and we can see the code. Now what we need to

93
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:14,540
do before we get started is rewrite all of this code.

94
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:20,570
because we have rewritten the JSON structure. And it now needs to support this modularized

95
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:25,310
templating system. So what we'll do is we'll just take a copy of this information.

96
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:29,800
So what I've done is pre-prepared a requirements document and we're just gonna say,

97
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,450
can you update it with the following? JSON, it needs to add three new template files

98
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:38,770
and we're gonna paste everything in and then we're just gonna let it do its job.

99
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,630
Now let's talk through what it's doing.

100
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:46,430
the provided code samples are not mandatory to use. The reason for this is that I've

101
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:52,700
done all this in Canvas. It's a great system, but I do want Aider to write the code

102
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:58,340
the way it thinks. It shouldn't be constrained by what I've given it. I've basically

103
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:03,530
told her it needs a template class for each template that we're doing plus a base

104
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:09,410
class, and that there'll be a presentation. I've also described the uh, data structure.

105
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:14,270
And so a lot of this requirements is in very human readable format that you could

106
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,740
just give to a developer.

107
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,400
we got the first three that I'd already set up manually,

108
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:23,770
we got the four new ones being added here. If we look at the base template class

109
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:27,280
as an example, if we go down to template four,

110
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:32,260
which is meant to map a H one and a H two plus a footer message, and then we've got

111
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,810
the date, and let's have a look at template

112
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:41,110
So it's got a H1 and H2 and a looping through the roles. Finally there's also an

113
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:46,630
image. And then at the bottom we've got this presentation class. So this is going

114
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:50,140
to be the requirements document that we're going to feed to Aider. So we'll just

115
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,940
click on this little button here.

116
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:57,150
Now I've put the requirements document into a file called to create presentation

117
00:08:57,150 --> 00:09:03,630
class. Now number one is from the previous video where we built the Reveal.js presentation

118
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:09,930
system. One of the things I'd run into a few problems was trying to add it into the

119
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:12,930
chat interface. So we'll just add right now and I think it's going to work. We'll

120
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:18,390
just go to and we've got the file name there. Now, the reason I was having issues

121
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:24,480
adding files was that they'd been added to VS code, but they hadn't been committed.

122
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,640
So make sure it's committed if you want to see it work within Aider. So from here

123
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,660
let's test it out.

124
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:34,890
So I've said, can you recreate? And we'll just go with presentation.js

125
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:39,880
this is an example of where it doesn't find the right document. So I'm just going

126
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:46,390
to grab the relative link to this file and let's see what happens. It's adding the

127
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:52,450
presentation.js to the chat. And hopefully we're going to get a bunch of new code

128
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:53,620
written right here.

129
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:58,680
So it's reported that it's added a base template class. We've got a presentation

130
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:04,620
builder replacement by presentation class. We've got slide rendering and initialization

131
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:10,680
code changed. And just so you know you can also see the cost. So that's costing $0.04

132
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:15,150
at the moment. And if we look through the code we've got a template template one

133
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:20,910
two. Let's go down to about four where we remember what they were like. We've got

134
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:27,930
number six was a complex one. So we've got a H1 and H2. We've got an image and we've

135
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:34,830
got the position and description inside of a loop. We can see the presentation code

136
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:39,180
going on here. One minor change that I'm going to do myself is that it should be

137
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:44,400
pointing to slides new. So let's just change that to new and we'll hit save.

138
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:49,260
Now, before we go through the changes that the code's created for the presentation,

139
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:53,160
let's look at the original presentation. And this was done in the previous video.

140
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:58,470
And one of the things that emphasizes is the use of infographics. In this case I'm

141
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:03,390
using napkin AI to generate them. There's a link in the description and we can see

142
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:07,950
this all coming together. It looked good. Let's see where we are now.

143
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:13,010
So we go over to the new presentation, and the first three slides that we got were

144
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:17,750
the ones that I generated when I was first creating the requirements document. And

145
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:23,240
one of the interesting edge cases I wanted to deal with was images in four quadrants.

146
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,320
So we've got the four images being shown. They will need to be positioned, but then

147
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:32,060
we move on to the three slides that were created from the mocks. So we've got the

148
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:36,830
first one. The second one. You can see part of the image from that mock down below,

149
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:42,410
and it's pulled it in because this particular mock had an image and it just happened

150
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:47,360
to use the mock as the example. But otherwise the rest of the data came from this

151
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,130
slide deck. And we can see it here. We've got Byron, we've got CEO of and that's

152
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:56,810
coming from this information here, followed by the repeating groups which were social

153
00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:03,140
media strategist and marketing expert. So the structure of our presentation looks

154
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,460
to be working okay.

155
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:09,680
Now we're about to start styling our slides using the mocks, but before we do, we've

156
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,240
got a little bit of setup so we can see over here on the right that we've got all

157
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:20,300
the CSS classes for Reveal.js all set up and ready to go, and that's what we've been

158
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:25,640
using throughout. We've also got our branding colors coming through. Now if we look

159
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:30,740
over here, we've got all these HTML templates that we've set up for each of the slide.

160
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:35,960
But what we don't have is a CSS selector that we can target in on.

161
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:41,030
Now I'm going to try the Aider watch files technique. I've had a few issues with

162
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:45,170
this. This doesn't always work for me, but we'll see what we get. And I'm just going

163
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,700
to put in a comment and paste in this prompt. Can you make sure that the template

164
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:55,160
HTML includes a template number class for each section? Now the important thing to

165
00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:01,790
do here is just say I will also put in an exclamation mark and I hit save. And it

166
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:07,130
looks like it might be working through this particular request. So if everything

167
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:13,700
works okay, I'm hoping to see a template one, two and three over here. So let's see

168
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:20,360
what's happening here. We've got class template one template two three, four five

169
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,980
and six. So perfect.

170
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,030
Now it worked Okay. For code, let's see what happens with CSS.

171
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:31,400
Now we have our custom CSS file. It's all got standard reveal sort of formatting

172
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:36,870
going on. I'd like to add some templates to the bottom here. So let's just put in

173
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:40,400
a CSS comment. We'll go like that and we'll paste in.

174
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:44,600
Can you update with placeholders for template one to six using ai?

175
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:49,610
Now I'll hit save. And one of the things I notice is that in this particular situation,

176
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:54,710
nothing changes. When you read the documentation, it says that it's looking for hashes

177
00:13:54,860 --> 00:14:00,410
or slashes at the beginning of a line. So what I'll do is I'll just put this in and

178
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:05,660
just see if this is good enough. Now it's not, and we'll try the hash just for good

179
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:11,000
measure and we'll cut this out and press save and go. Let's do it differently and

180
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,830
say, can you

181
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:18,200
update custom CSS with, and we'll just paste it in

182
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,660
And hopefully we'll get the changes this way

183
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:24,720
so we can see all the changes starting to come through at the moment.

184
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:30,600
And so it's put in a lot of CSS. This is actually not what I wanted because I really

185
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:35,310
only wanted some start placeholders, but I think since it's done it, we should at

186
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:36,270
least test it out.

187
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:40,950
So here's a side by side comparison. On the left, we've got the older version and

188
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:45,480
we've got the newer version on the right. So we'll just move forward and old. And

189
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:50,010
the new one is just looking a little bit different. We've got this gradient effect

190
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:54,210
going on right here. We'll go and have a look at these images. We wanna see 'em in

191
00:14:54,240 --> 00:15:00,900
four quadrants, and that seems to be working okay. We move on to the fourth one and

192
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,800
it's just a little bit different look and feel. In fact, this looks good. This is

193
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,610
meant to be a footer. So the basic changes are looking

194
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:09,760
pretty good to me.

195
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,750
and if we move on to the sixth one, what do we get?

196
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:17,210
This looks quite a bit different. In fact, this is nice that it's showing the image

197
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:23,060
in a circle. Now the reality is this is not following the mocks, but this is a pretty

198
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:26,690
good starting point for our styling, for each of the different templates.

199
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:31,970
So here's the first design that we want to work with. We've got one dot jpeg and

200
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:32,480
we're meant

201
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:37,390
template number four so that it looks like and we'll just type in one dot jpeg and

202
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:43,720
we'll press enter and see what happens. So we've got changes coming through for template

203
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,970
four. There's a fair few coming in

204
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,080
and it's told us what it's done including the split color design. Let's go see how

205
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:51,830
it looks.

206
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:57,450
So here we have the old, which I really like. Let's go look at the new. And the new

207
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:03,030
is looking very close to the mark, except for two things. We've got this social media

208
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:09,030
heading, one which should just be above the line here. And this strategy should definitely

209
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,140
be down below.

210
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:16,230
I've taken a screenshot of the current example, and I've said the H1 should be slightly

211
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:22,260
higher and not overlapping the brown area, and the H2 should be the same size as

212
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:24,810
the H1, and it should be over the brown area.

213
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:28,850
So I've just taken a screenshot of this particular page

214
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:32,970
and I'll just see if I can paste it in. Now that's not working. So there's a bit

215
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:34,950
of confusion about how to use this.

216
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,130
Oh bloody hell.

217
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:42,400
So moving on to mock number two. We got it over here on the right and it's mapping

218
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:47,980
to template number five. So we'll just put in can you update template five in custom

219
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:54,310
CSS so that it looks like. And we'll just put in two dot jpeg and press enter. It'll

220
00:16:54,310 --> 00:17:00,790
add it to the chat and it seems to have hung. So one of the things you might have

221
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:05,290
noticed is that there's been a few different bugs that I'm dealing with as I'm working

222
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:10,600
with Aider, so there's still some areas of improvement just in the basic usability.

223
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:16,150
So what I think we'll do is we'll just cut this all the way out and start again.

224
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:21,980
So new setup and we'll just say two dot jpeg. And that's looking good. We'll say

225
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:29,870
yes and we'll say yes. So that added in the custom CSS and added in the JPEG. And

226
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:35,360
the code that we're hoping will change is just in here. We can see it coming through

227
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,230
at the moment

228
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:41,980
and it's about to change right now I'm assuming. Oh look at that, I haven't. There's

229
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:46,440
another thing to be aware of. If you change things here, you you might have a little

230
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:53,640
bit of conflict. So if I hit save yeah. Let's just remove that altogether. And now

231
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:59,010
we do have a complete set of changes to template five highlighting. Yet another challenge

232
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:05,160
to be aware of is that if you have left some edits in some code but you haven't saved

233
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:10,480
it, then it's going to cause a little bit of a conflict when Aider starts generating

234
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:10,950
code.

235
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:17,620
So here we have a few problems. It's getting close. One of the things it's done is

236
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:22,420
it's missed the main topic. So we need to get that in. And everything should be on

237
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:27,310
the right and vertical. So we can see today's presentation in the middle. And we've

238
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:33,190
got the bullet points here. Also I think just the graphics itself with this little

239
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:39,280
yellow box got a little bit confusing for it. I'm going to actually describe everything

240
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,170
in a prompt and see if I can fix it.

241
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:46,410
Now here we have our reference or our mock image on the left, and we've got the updated

242
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:51,180
slide on the right. It's starting to look close to what I want, but the problem I

243
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:56,460
had was I actually had to use a whole lot of standard prompt engineering to get it

244
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:02,010
looking like this. I didn't find in this second example that the image to CSS was

245
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:03,390
working too well for me.

246
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:08,400
So for our third test we're going to try and get the HTML that's on the right looking

247
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,470
like the mock that's on the left. Now this is known as template six in the system.

248
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:18,900
And what I've done is I've got this image here of the mock. But I've also got an

249
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:23,380
image of what it currently looks like. We should be able to feed them both into Aider.

250
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:26,430
So I'm just going to start by adding a couple of files.

251
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:34,860
we'll add in 3.jpeg and we'll let that go into the system. And we will add in current.png

252
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:40,900
And that's my example of what it currently looks like.

253
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:44,940
So I'm just saying can you update template six in the custom

254
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:50,710
I've given the currently looking image and we'll see what happens. And I'm not sure

255
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:56,710
whether it's going to change CSS and template. But here it is starting to generate.

256
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,670
And so it's made a change to template six. Let's test it out.

257
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:06,030
So here's what it's come up with in both desktop mode and mobile mode. So we can't

258
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:09,660
see the yellow box there isn't the vertical alignment going

259
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:15,070
So I played around with a few prompts. And firstly I added in this current image

260
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:20,230
which is the top left hand image. And I also did a current mobile so I could see

261
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,940
different points of view.

262
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:26,070
then I just told it that I wanted it to notice the yellow in the top, the white in

263
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:31,440
the bottom, the image on the right and the vertical alignment of the different text.

264
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:37,140
Now it told me that it needed some extra information, which I gave it in the form

265
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:42,900
of the presentation JS and the custom CSS, and it generated a whole lot of code for

266
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,120
us. Let's have a look at what that looks like.

267
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:49,630
And now we're starting to look on point. Now there are differences, but in some respects

268
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:53,980
I like it the way it is. So let's put the image up in the top right hand corner.

269
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:58,960
It needs to be moved down to the middle. And these two areas need to be on top of

270
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,130
each other. But at the moment they look quite clean the way they are. So I might

271
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,230
actually leave this template the way it is.

272
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:10,920
As a recap, let's have a look at how they looked in Canva and how they look in Reveal.js.

273
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:15,750
So it's looking pretty good. It would need a little bit of work, but I like where

274
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:20,460
it's at. If we look at the next template, this one didn't work out so well when I

275
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:25,620
moved it over to reveal, so this would require a little bit of manual. Changing the

276
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:31,230
image to CSS was a bit problematic with this one, but the last one actually worked

277
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:36,600
quite well, though it gave a little bit different look and feel, but this is something

278
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:43,890
I could work with. So in this experience, the image to CSS for Reveal.js it worked

279
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:47,250
okay, but here's my final thoughts.

280
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:52,630
So here's a honest assessment of Aider in the area of converting images into code

281
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:54,100
and other data structures.

282
00:21:54,120 --> 00:22:00,440
Mostly this was painful. This might have looked okay, but the video probably took

283
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:06,980
me three times as long as I expected because of the amount of backwards and forwards.

284
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:12,320
Where it was really simple and where I'd use it over and over again was data extraction.

285
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,860
If you're trying to get data out of an image, this is a great tool and because you

286
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:21,590
can automate it, there's all sorts of use cases, but converting it into CSS was problematic.

287
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:25,250
part of the reason it's problematic is because there's another framework involved

288
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:30,410
and that's revealed js. So I can understand some of the challenges that it went through,

289
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:37,250
but I ran into a number of bugs and a number of going, one path, backtracking going

290
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:38,330
down another path.

291
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:43,480
so at the moment it's got some useful features, but generally this is not a use case

292
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,240
that I'd want to try again anytime soon.

293
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:51,300
I'm AppyDave. Please like and subscribe. And in the next video I'm going to be continuing

294
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,590
my journey with Aider.
