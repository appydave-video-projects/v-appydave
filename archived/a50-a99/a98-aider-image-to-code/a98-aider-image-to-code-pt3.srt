1
00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:04,910
So for our third test we're going to try and get the HTML that's on the right looking 

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:09,980
like the mock that's on the left. Now this is known as template six in the system. 

3
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:15,410
And what I've done is I've got this image here of the mock. But I've also got an 

4
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:19,890
image of what it currently looks like. We should be able to feed them both into Aider.

5
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,940
So I'm just going to start by adding a couple of files. 

6
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:31,370
we'll add in 3.jpeg and we'll let that go into the system. And we will add in current.png 

7
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,410
And that's my example of what it currently looks like.

8
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:41,450
So I'm just saying can you update template six in the custom 

9
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:47,220
I've given the currently looking image and we'll see what happens. And I'm not sure 

10
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:53,220
whether it's going to change CSS and template. But here it is starting to generate.

11
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:57,180
And so it's made a change to template six. Let's test it out.

12
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:02,540
So here's what it's come up with in both desktop mode and mobile mode. So we can't 

13
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:06,170
see the yellow box there isn't the vertical alignment going 

14
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:11,580
So I played around with a few prompts. And firstly I added in this current image 

15
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:16,740
which is the top left hand image. And I also did a current mobile so I could see 

16
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,450
different points of view. 

17
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:22,580
then I just told it that I wanted it to notice the yellow in the top, the white in 

18
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:27,950
the bottom, the image on the right and the vertical alignment of the different text. 

19
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:33,650
Now it told me that it needed some extra information, which I gave it in the form 

20
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:39,410
of the presentation JS and the custom CSS, and it generated a whole lot of code for 

21
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:41,630
us. Let's have a look at what that looks like.

22
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:46,140
And now we're starting to look on point. Now there are differences, but in some respects 

23
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,490
I like it the way it is. So let's put the image up in the top right hand corner. 

24
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:55,470
It needs to be moved down to the middle. And these two areas need to be on top of 

25
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:59,640
each other. But at the moment they look quite clean the way they are. So I might 

26
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,740
actually leave this template the way it is.

27
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:07,430
As a recap, let's have a look at how they looked in Canva and how they look in Reveal.js. 

28
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:12,260
So it's looking pretty good. It would need a little bit of work, but I like where 

29
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:16,970
it's at. If we look at the next template, this one didn't work out so well when I 

30
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:22,130
moved it over to reveal, so this would require a little bit of manual. Changing the 

31
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:27,740
image to CSS was a bit problematic with this one, but the last one actually worked 

32
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:33,110
quite well, though it gave a little bit different look and feel, but this is something 

33
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:40,400
I could work with. So in this experience, the image to CSS for Reveal.js it worked 

34
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,760
okay, but here's my final thoughts.

35
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:49,140
So here's a honest assessment of Aider in the area of converting images into code 

36
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,610
and other data structures. 

37
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:56,950
Mostly this was painful. This might have looked okay, but the video probably took 

38
00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:03,490
me three times as long as I expected because of the amount of backwards and forwards. 

39
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:08,830
Where it was really simple and where I'd use it over and over again was data extraction. 

40
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:12,370
If you're trying to get data out of an image, this is a great tool and because you 

41
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:18,100
can automate it, there's all sorts of use cases, but converting it into CSS was problematic. 

42
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:21,760
part of the reason it's problematic is because there's another framework involved 

43
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,920
and that's revealed js. So I can understand some of the challenges that it went through, 

44
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:33,760
but I ran into a number of bugs and a number of going, one path, backtracking going 

45
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,840
down another path. 

46
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:39,990
so at the moment it's got some useful features, but generally this is not a use case 

47
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:42,750
that I'd want to try again anytime soon.
