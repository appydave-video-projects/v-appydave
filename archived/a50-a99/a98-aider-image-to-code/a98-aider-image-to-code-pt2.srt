00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:04,760
Now, before we go through the changes that the code's created for the presentation, 

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:08,660
let's look at the original presentation. And this was done in the previous video. 

3
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:13,970
And one of the things that emphasizes is the use of infographics. In this case I'm 

4
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:18,890
using napkin AI to generate them. There's a link in the description and we can see 

5
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:23,450
this all coming together. It looked good. Let's see where we are now.

6
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:28,510
So we go over to the new presentation, and the first three slides that we got were 

7
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:33,250
the ones that I generated when I was first creating the requirements document. And 

8
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:38,740
one of the interesting edge cases I wanted to deal with was images in four quadrants. 

9
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:42,820
So we've got the four images being shown. They will need to be positioned, but then 

10
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:47,560
we move on to the three slides that were created from the mocks. So we've got the 

11
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:52,330
first one. The second one. You can see part of the image from that mock down below, 

12
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:57,910
and it's pulled it in because this particular mock had an image and it just happened 

13
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:02,860
to use the mock as the example. But otherwise the rest of the data came from this 

14
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:07,630
slide deck. And we can see it here. We've got Byron, we've got CEO of and that's 

15
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:12,310
coming from this information here, followed by the repeating groups which were social 

16
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:18,640
media strategist and marketing expert. So the structure of our presentation looks 

17
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,960
to be working okay.

18
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:25,180
Now we're about to start styling our slides using the mocks, but before we do, we've 

19
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:29,740
got a little bit of setup so we can see over here on the right that we've got all 

20
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:35,800
the CSS classes for Reveal.js all set up and ready to go, and that's what we've been 

21
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:41,140
using throughout. We've also got our branding colors coming through. Now if we look 

22
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:46,240
over here, we've got all these HTML templates that we've set up for each of the slide. 

23
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,460
But what we don't have is a CSS selector that we can target in on.

24
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:56,530
Now I'm going to try the Aider watch files technique. I've had a few issues with 

25
00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:00,670
this. This doesn't always work for me, but we'll see what we get. And I'm just going 

26
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:05,200
to put in a comment and paste in this prompt. Can you make sure that the template 

27
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:10,660
HTML includes a template number class for each section? Now the important thing to 

28
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:17,290
do here is just say I will also put in an exclamation mark and I hit save. And it 

29
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:22,630
looks like it might be working through this particular request. So if everything 

30
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:29,200
works okay, I'm hoping to see a template one, two and three over here. So let's see 

31
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:35,860
what's happening here. We've got class template one template two three, four five 

32
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,480
and six. So perfect.

33
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:41,530
Now it worked Okay. For code, let's see what happens with CSS. 

34
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:46,900
Now we have our custom CSS file. It's all got standard reveal sort of formatting 

35
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:52,370
going on. I'd like to add some templates to the bottom here. So let's just put in 

36
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:55,900
a CSS comment. We'll go like that and we'll paste in. 

37
00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:00,100
Can you update with placeholders for template one to six using ai? 

38
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:05,110
Now I'll hit save. And one of the things I notice is that in this particular situation, 

39
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:10,210
nothing changes. When you read the documentation, it says that it's looking for hashes 

40
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:15,910
or slashes at the beginning of a line. So what I'll do is I'll just put this in and 

41
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:21,160
just see if this is good enough. Now it's not, and we'll try the hash just for good 

42
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:26,500
measure and we'll cut this out and press save and go. Let's do it differently and 

43
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,330
say, can you 

44
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:33,700
update custom CSS with, and we'll just paste it in 

45
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,160
And hopefully we'll get the changes this way 

46
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:40,220
so we can see all the changes starting to come through at the moment. 

47
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:46,100
And so it's put in a lot of CSS. This is actually not what I wanted because I really 

48
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:50,810
only wanted some start placeholders, but I think since it's done it, we should at 

49
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:51,770
least test it out.

50
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:56,450
So here's a side by side comparison. On the left, we've got the older version and 

51
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:00,980
we've got the newer version on the right. So we'll just move forward and old. And 

52
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:05,510
the new one is just looking a little bit different. We've got this gradient effect 

53
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:09,710
going on right here. We'll go and have a look at these images. We wanna see 'em in 

54
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:16,400
four quadrants, and that seems to be working okay. We move on to the fourth one and 

55
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,300
it's just a little bit different look and feel. In fact, this looks good. This is 

56
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:24,110
meant to be a footer. So the basic changes are looking 

57
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,260
pretty good to me. 

58
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,250
and if we move on to the sixth one, what do we get? 

59
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:32,710
This looks quite a bit different. In fact, this is nice that it's showing the image 

60
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:38,560
in a circle. Now the reality is this is not following the mocks, but this is a pretty 

61
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,190
good starting point for our styling, for each of the different templates.

62
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:47,470
So here's the first design that we want to work with. We've got one dot jpeg and 

63
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:47,980
we're meant 

64
00:04:48,00 --> 00:04:52,890
template number four so that it looks like and we'll just type in one dot jpeg and 

65
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:59,220
we'll press enter and see what happens. So we've got changes coming through for template 

66
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,470
four. There's a fair few coming in

67
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:06,580
and it's told us what it's done including the split color design. Let's go see how 

68
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,330
it looks.

69
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,950
So here we have the old, which I really like. Let's go look at the new. And the new 

70
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:18,530
is looking very close to the mark, except for two things. We've got this social media 

71
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:24,530
heading, one which should just be above the line here. And this strategy should definitely 

72
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:25,640
be down below. 

73
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:31,730
I've taken a screenshot of the current example, and I've said the H1 should be slightly 

74
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:37,760
higher and not overlapping the brown area, and the H2 should be the same size as 

75
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:40,310
the H1, and it should be over the brown area. 

76
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:44,350
So I've just taken a screenshot of this particular page

77
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,470
and I'll just see if I can paste it in. Now that's not working. So there's a bit 

78
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:50,450
of confusion about how to use this.

79
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,630
Oh bloody hell.

80
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:57,900
So moving on to mock number two. We got it over here on the right and it's mapping 

81
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:03,480
to template number five. So we'll just put in can you update template five in custom 

82
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:09,810
CSS so that it looks like. And we'll just put in two dot jpeg and press enter. It'll 

83
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:16,290
add it to the chat and it seems to have hung. So one of the things you might have 

84
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:20,790
noticed is that there's been a few different bugs that I'm dealing with as I'm working 

85
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:26,100
with Aider, so there's still some areas of improvement just in the basic usability. 

86
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:31,650
So what I think we'll do is we'll just cut this all the way out and start again.

87
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:37,480
So new setup and we'll just say two dot jpeg. And that's looking good. We'll say 

88
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:45,370
yes and we'll say yes. So that added in the custom CSS and added in the JPEG. And 

89
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:50,860
the code that we're hoping will change is just in here. We can see it coming through 

90
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:51,730
at the moment

91
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:57,480
and it's about to change right now I'm assuming. Oh look at that, I haven't. There's 

92
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:01,940
another thing to be aware of. If you change things here, you you might have a little 

93
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:09,140
bit of conflict. So if I hit save yeah. Let's just remove that altogether. And now 

94
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:14,510
we do have a complete set of changes to template five highlighting. Yet another challenge 

95
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:20,660
to be aware of is that if you have left some edits in some code but you haven't saved 

96
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:25,980
it, then it's going to cause a little bit of a conflict when Aider starts generating 

97
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:26,450
code.

98
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:33,120
So here we have a few problems. It's getting close. One of the things it's done is 

99
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,920
it's missed the main topic. So we need to get that in. And everything should be on 

100
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:42,810
the right and vertical. So we can see today's presentation in the middle. And we've 

101
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:48,690
got the bullet points here. Also I think just the graphics itself with this little 

102
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:54,780
yellow box got a little bit confusing for it. I'm going to actually describe everything 

103
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,670
in a prompt and see if I can fix it.

104
00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:01,910
Now here we have our reference or our mock image on the left, and we've got the updated 

105
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:06,680
slide on the right. It's starting to look close to what I want, but the problem I 

106
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:11,960
had was I actually had to use a whole lot of standard prompt engineering to get it 

107
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:17,510
looking like this. I didn't find in this second example that the image to CSS was 

108
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,890
working too well for me.
