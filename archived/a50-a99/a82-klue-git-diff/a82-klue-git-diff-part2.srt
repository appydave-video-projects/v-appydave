00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:07,400
So I was able to use cursor I to take this PR with 950 file changes. There's 2200 

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:15,110
diffs and recreate a new PR with over a thousand changes in it. 412 files. And this 

3
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:19,340
was all with the power of simple automation scripts and cursor AI.

4
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:25,400
Now, contrary to that last statement, not everything was fun, and I took a bunch 

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,260
of notes along the way of what happens. So there's this idea of pressing command 

6
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:36,230
Y on the Mac, which will apply the changes automatically for you one at a time. And 

7
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:41,650
it's a great tool. I was using it all the time, but you can't do it until all the 

8
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:47,900
changes have been processed in the file. So if you've got many changes, say 20, you 

9
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:51,140
might be waiting around for 20 or 30s before you can even start.

10
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:55,570
Now, if you want to do a bulk set up, one of the things I noticed is that as you're 

11
00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:00,130
pressing, apply on each of these, you're getting the changes over here. You can press 

12
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:05,470
command Y or command. And if you don't want to accept the change. But once they're 

13
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:10,810
all in place, you can press the accept. Now, you'll see soon that I didn't use this 

14
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:15,490
feature because I kept finding little edge cases where things didn't work, and I 

15
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:18,430
had to manually check every line as I went.

16
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:22,620
I sometimes found the speed at which I could get stuff done here, being impaired 

17
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:27,420
through the way it was communicating messages. There were inconsistencies with the 

18
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:32,490
colors that would show up on the bar. There were inconsistencies with the messaging, 

19
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:38,760
and I'd be sitting here waiting, going, has it finished yet or not? So sometimes 

20
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,710
things just took longer than I think they should have.

21
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:46,440
That also led into issues with using the mouse and the command y together. If you 

22
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:51,330
press page down and your cursor goes below an area that's changed and then you press 

23
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:56,430
command Y, it would actually do the next area. So there was a little bit of challenges 

24
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:00,600
just getting used to how that interface works. But the big problems happen to be 

25
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:06,360
with code not working the way you would think. So here we had a change, and it actually 

26
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:11,580
changed a variable name from an act to not an act. So this was something that I wasn't 

27
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:16,890
able to accept. Then it was making some legitimate changes, but they weren't in keeping 

28
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:22,830
with the prompt or were still it would just create an actual bug by taking something 

29
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,930
out that was meant to be there.

30
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:29,370
Once I was getting into the groove of working with 15 changes at a time, that's how 

31
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:34,500
the prompts were set up. I decided to increase it to 100, and at that point things 

32
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:41,460
just stopped working, and the way it communicated just didn't really give me an idea 

33
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:45,330
of what was going on. So it might just make one file change. So I had to go back 

34
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:49,710
to smaller prompts, which is fair enough with large language models, but it was something 

35
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:55,860
I learnt. And if we come down to five, six and seven, these are pretty much similar 

36
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:59,760
to the ones before where it's gone and made these odd changes that would only introduce 

37
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,180
bugs into the system. So same with number eight.

38
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:08,230
If you want access to the code that I use to generate the diffs and the prompts, 

39
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:13,330
check out the link in the description. I also put a link to the clueless coding language 

40
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:18,400
ideas that I'm working through at the moment. In the next video, I plan to use v0 

41
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,130
to create a video asset management tool to communicate with a video editor, so stay 

42
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:28,30
tuned for that. I'm AppyDave. Please like and subscribe! See you soon!
