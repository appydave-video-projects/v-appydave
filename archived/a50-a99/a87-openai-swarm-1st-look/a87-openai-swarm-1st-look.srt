00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:06,210
Two days ago, OpenAI released Swarm. Now what it is is an educational framework for 

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:11,740
developers, and it's about building multi-agent workflows. What we're going to do 

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,820
today is we're going to come up to the code and click on clone and bring it down 

4
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:19,890
to the computer. After that, we'll look through some of the documentation, see how 

5
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,420
it works, look at it a little bit of code. And finally we're going to go through 

6
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,790
the examples. So they've got a bunch of examples available inside the code base. 

7
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:33,720
And we'll test them out on the system I'm AppyDave. Please like and subscribe. Let's 

8
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,470
get into it.

9
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:40,140
The Swarm project is focusing on execution and coordination, and it has two different 

10
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:45,420
concepts within it. One is called agents and the other is handoffs. And with agents, 

11
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:50,520
what we're looking at are instructions and tools with the handoffs. If we go over 

12
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,530
to the document related to this, there's a cookbook orchestrating agents routines 

13
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:56,520
and handoffs. 

14
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:01,640
it's defined as an agent that hands off processing to another agent.

15
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:06,850
Now, the Swarm project is essentially an area to explore patterns the patterns for 

16
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:11,980
lightweight, scalable, and highly customizable design. This is not a replacement 

17
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:17,950
for Crew AI or other sorts of frameworks like that as yet, and it's more about educating 

18
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:23,320
developers on how they can work with large language models in a workflow and step 

19
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,580
oriented system.

20
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,560
to get started let's come to the top here. We're going to click on code. And in this 

21
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,560
case I'm going to use GitHub CLI. 

22
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:37,520
I've just created a folder called test. And we're going to paste in gh repo clone 

23
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,300
OpenAI / Swarm and let it come down.

24
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:45,840
Now the repository with the examples are on the computer. But what we'll do is we'll 

25
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,390
come here and we'll click on the install command. 

26
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,720
coming back to the terminal, we'll just paste in that command and make sure it's 

27
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,200
installed. 

28
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,260
Now I've opened up the repository here in VSCode and we should check out a few things. 

29
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:02,500
if we open up the Swarm directory, you'll see that there's a little bit of code going 

30
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:07,720
on in the system, and we'll check some of that out later if needed. There's examples 

31
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:12,100
and we're definitely going to be working through here. But it's the assets will start 

32
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:16,450
with. So if we go and look at the Swarm diagram you can see what's the weather in 

33
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,830
New York. 

34
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:23,860
that's being sent to a triage assistant. And its job is to go, well what is the question 

35
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:29,620
coming in and hand it off to the correct agent. In this case it's the weather assistant 

36
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:36,700
and it says it's 67 degrees in New York. Now, if we come back and look at the examples, 

37
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:40,660
there's already a weather agent system that we can go and look at. If we look at 

38
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:45,700
the Readme file, it says, this example is a weather agent demonstrating function 

39
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,520
calling with a single agent. So very similar to what we just saw 

40
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:53,130
Now getting started. When you look at this file, there's the import of the agent 

41
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:58,440
from Swarm. And then there's two functions going on. And we can see that these functions 

42
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:04,110
are being put into an array on the functions property of the agent. And we'll look 

43
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:08,820
a bit later as to how this is actually running. But let's have a look at some of 

44
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:14,370
the documentation related. So I've put together this image that shows that it's initiating 

45
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:19,230
the weather agent. And then it's delegating to the get weather request. And some 

46
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:24,330
input parameters need to come through to that. The location and the time from that. 

47
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:28,230
It should be able to retrieve the weather data. Now this is mock data that comes 

48
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:32,460
through in the system. But this is where you would put call to an API. And then after 

49
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:37,350
that it's returned the weather information. And it can then do other tasks such as 

50
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:42,810
sending an email. And if you provide the correct email details, the goal would be 

51
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:43,920
that it sends an email.

52
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:48,850
Now further into the documentation. What the main starting point is, is an agent 

53
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:53,440
and it just has a system prompt or an instruction called you are a helpful agent. 

54
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,970
And the only other thing it knows about is that it's got two functions that it can 

55
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:03,430
delegate responsibility to the get weather and the send email. So when we look at 

56
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:07,330
those functions, we'll see that the get weather is get the current weather in a given 

57
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:12,880
location. Location must be a city. And that's listed. And there's also a time. And 

58
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:17,620
this by at the moment when we look at the functions will default to. Now the goal 

59
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:21,910
of this is to return some sort of JSON structure that has the information we need. 

60
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:27,130
There's also an additional function going on called Send email. With that it takes 

61
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,270
a recipient subject and body and we'll see how well that works.

62
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:35,980
So let's work out how we're going to run this. So it's pretty simple. It says here 

63
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:42,690
Python three run py. Now what is that. So we're currently looking at code from the 

64
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:48,180
agents py. There's also this run py and it's taking the weather agent that we've 

65
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:53,560
just defined right here and putting it through to something called run demo loop. 

66
00:04:53,560 --> 00:05:00,730
So what is that? So if we come down to the Swarm area we have this file called repl.py. 

67
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:05,740
And within that we've got the ability to process and print the streaming responses. 

68
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:12,400
We can do pretty messages, but the main loop that's going on is sitting here. So 

69
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,900
the incoming agent in this case weather agent would come in through here and it would 

70
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,690
get passed in

71
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:23,390
to the client, run in the agent variable. And the agent variable is just being loaded 

72
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:23,990
there.

73
00:05:24,00 --> 00:05:28,300
So I've got the code open, but we've come into terminal and what we'll do is we'll 

74
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:34,180
CD into the examples web agent folder. From there we should be able to do the Python 

75
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:37,540
three run.pi and see what we get. 

76
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:42,960
the first thing it's saying is who is the user? And I say I might just say hi, I'm 

77
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:48,930
AppyDave and we'll see what it comes up with. Hello AppyDave, how can I assist you 

78
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:53,310
today? What is the temperature?

79
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:59,500
You can't spell I think in Sydney and we'll see what it comes up with. So it's calling 

80
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:06,140
a function called Get Weather and it says the current temperature in Sydney is 65°F. 

81
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:11,150
Now when we look at the code we can see that that's hard coded into the system.

82
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,870
So if you want this to return a real value, you would go and change this line so 

83
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:20,790
that it's calling some sort of API to get the current weather for the location and 

84
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:26,160
time. But let's move on to the next one. So this is sending an email to a recipient. 

85
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,460
there's three parameters going on. Who is it two subject and body. Let's see how 

86
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:31,910
this works.

87
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:35,660
Now we're back at the terminal and I'm going to say, 

88
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:42,230
can you send email to David at AppyDave.com and see what it comes up with. 

89
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:46,770
it said could you please provide the subject and body of the email. 

90
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,690
subject.

91
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,310
is hot today

92
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:54,870
it's come back with this message. The email has been sent to david@appydave.com with 

93
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:59,850
the subject what is hot and the body Agent Workflow Builder is hot today. 

94
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:04,340
Agent Workflow Builder is a software application that I'm building in public at the 

95
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:09,320
moment. So I'm demonstrating the code as it goes. And it's basically around designing 

96
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:12,290
agent workflows like the ones we're working with right now.

97
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:17,350
with the weather agent complete, let's close that down and we'll move on to the triage 

98
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:22,180
agent. Now, if we go and look at the readme file first, we can see this is an example 

99
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:28,300
of a Swarm with a triage agent takes user inputs. It can respond directly, or it 

100
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:34,360
can triage and send to other agents like the sales and refund. It says that we can 

101
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:38,650
run it from the command line using Python three run. If we look at that, we'll see 

102
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:43,960
that it's using that same run demo loop example we saw earlier. If we go into the 

103
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:50,200
code, we'll see that we've got a couple of handoff functions. We've got three different 

104
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,200
agents going on some more handoff functions. 

105
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:57,680
let's have a look at that documentation here. We've got this example of the Swarm 

106
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:04,280
containing triage agent will take inputs from the user and decide what to do, including 

107
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:08,900
sending it to the sales and refunds. So we can see the triage agent going on here. 

108
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:14,570
It understands what the request type is, and we'll send it to one of these two agents. 

109
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:19,490
Now from this point, the agents have their own logic that they can do. They can proceed 

110
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:25,640
with doing a sale, they can apply discounts or do refunds. So there's a bunch of 

111
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:30,260
things going on in here. Now, if we look at it from this documentation point of view, 

112
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:35,540
there's the main agent. And the instructions are determine which agent is best suited 

113
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:40,430
to handle the user's request and transfer the conversation. And who can it transfer 

114
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:45,890
to a handoff function called transfer to sales and one called transfer to refunds.

115
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:50,100
So after that, you can see there's a few functions going on here, and some of them 

116
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:54,540
return messages like this a message indicating success of the refund, and another 

117
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:59,850
one message indicating that the discount was applied, but some of the others will 

118
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:05,160
just send information back to a different agent. So this one just comes back to itself. 

119
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,660
Or we can send it off to the sales agent or the refunds agent.

120
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:14,530
So when we look at the sales agent, it's got a main system instruction called be 

121
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:19,210
super enthusiastic about selling bees. Now, if it can't handle the question coming 

122
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:24,190
in, it's only job is to go back to the triage agent a bit further on. We've got the 

123
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:29,830
refunds agent, and the main instruction for the refund agent is help the user with 

124
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:35,500
a refund. If the reason was too expensive, offer the user a refund code. If they 

125
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,810
insist, then process the refund. 

126
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:43,560
we've got two different hand-off functions going on processing and applying discounts 

127
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:47,490
and otherwise. Let's go back to the triage with this one as well.

128
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:51,270
let's go and have a look at a bit of code. We've got a couple of functions going 

129
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:56,220
on here. We'll come back to them in a moment because the next area is there are three 

130
00:09:56,250 --> 00:10:01,950
agents being defined. Now. The first agent with a name and instructions is going 

131
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:06,810
to control the whole process. From that it has a sales agent 

132
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:11,490
we can work with. And one of the things that the refunds agent can do is delegate 

133
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:17,430
responsibility to handoffs. So we've got the process refund and the apply discount. 

134
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:22,300
we can see that information going on here. Now if we come back to the sales agent 

135
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:27,370
and we go be super enthusiastic about selling bees, and I think that might be the 

136
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:31,960
first thing that we can just play around with and change before we run the agent. 

137
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:37,910
what we'll do is change bees to where selling Agent Workflow Builder. This is the 

138
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:42,710
application that I'm building in public around designing these sorts of workflows. 

139
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:48,140
Now the next thing we've got is help the users with a refund. If the reason is that 

140
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:53,600
it's too expensive, offer the user a refund code. Well, why don't we change that 

141
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,430
to a discount code 

142
00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:01,240
we'll call it AWB Early Access. After that, we've got a couple more hand off functions 

143
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:06,430
that we can call, and they're being linked up to the triage agent right here. 

144
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:10,670
Now, after that, we've got a final set of handoff functions. So if we think of the 

145
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:16,430
first two handoff functions as being used by the refunds agent here, then what these 

146
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:21,890
ones offer is the transfer back to triage is available to both the sales and the 

147
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,330
refund agent, 

148
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:29,180
Whereas the triage agent can send things to either the sales or the refunds agent.

149
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,980
So I've just come down to terminal. We're in Swarm 

150
00:11:32,00 --> 00:11:36,150
I think I'm just going to paste in Agent Workflow Builder see what it comes up with. 

151
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:40,590
It says it looks like you're interested in building a workflow for agents. That's 

152
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:41,970
exactly true. 

153
00:11:42,00 --> 00:11:46,540
I might just say can I get a discount.

154
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,250
That would be great. So it's thinking at the moment it says, could you please let 

155
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:56,800
me know the reason you're looking for a discount? I can offer you a discount code 

156
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,660
of AWB Early Access. That sounds good. 

157
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:09,790
I want the AWB early access. Can you apply it? 

158
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:16,380
I've successfully applied the discount using the code AWB Early Access. It's added 

159
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:21,150
to your cart, saving you $100. So let's see if we can buy it. 

160
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:25,880
I would like to buy AWB.

161
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:32,460
B and it says great choice to purchase of Agent Workflow Builder you can proceed 

162
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:40,230
to the cart with the discount already applied by it. I wonder whether this is actually 

163
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,160
going to work. 

164
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:45,860
So it says it looks like you're ready to make a purchase. I'll transfer you back 

165
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:52,910
to our triage agent, so we'll assume it's done. What I'll say is, I have bought. 

166
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:55,730
When will you ship?

167
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,600
it's just come back with four inquiries related to shipping and order delivery. Let 

168
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:04,920
me transfer you to our sales consultant. So I think we'll go and do a bit of a loop 

169
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:10,500
if we keep doing this. But that's the triage. And we've had multiple agents working 

170
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,820
together. We've been able to go back to the master agent. We've been able to go back 

171
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,530
to the triage agent. 

172
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:21,900
we've been able to go from the refund agent to the sales agent. And this is a pretty 

173
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,310
interesting workflow.

174
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:28,560
So let's go back to the code and see what we just went through. We came in using 

175
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:33,120
the triage agent, and from that I asked for a discount. So that took us over to the 

176
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,100
discount agent that I've put here. 

177
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:39,660
we saw both of these function handoffs called. So we've got the process discount 

178
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:45,930
the applied discount. And you can see it said discounting item because and it had 

179
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:50,190
some sort of reason. And then it said applying a discount and said applied $100 to 

180
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:54,450
your cart. Now at that point I also had a couple of issues getting back to the sales 

181
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:59,430
agent. And when I came back and looked at the code, it made complete sense why it 

182
00:13:59,430 --> 00:13:59,910
happened.

183
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:04,680
the reason for that is that the discount agent currently has three areas that can 

184
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:09,720
go to. It can process a discount. It can apply a discount. The only other area it 

185
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:14,430
can do down here is go back to triage. So the next step would have been to go back 

186
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:19,530
to the operator the triage. And from there move on to the sales. So all up this is 

187
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:22,560
an incredible little workflow and really quite simple.

188
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,730
So we've finished the weather bot. That was fairly simple. We've moved on and done 

189
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:32,800
the triage, sales and refund bot. That's a little bit more complex. Let's see what's 

190
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:36,730
next. So if we minimize this file 

191
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:40,340
and we go over to the support bot, we can see that there's a fair bit more going 

192
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:45,110
on. There's a requirements.txt going on. We've got a Docker container. Looks like 

193
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:49,250
we've got a bunch of articles in the form of JSON documents.

194
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:53,240
Now, what I want to do is see if I can get this up and running. So we've got the 

195
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:58,760
user interface agent and the help center agent, and there's a bunch of things that 

196
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,430
we've got to do. I've already run the make install. 

197
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:06,200
So let's just get Docker Composer up. We'll start that it's running. 

198
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:11,580
So we come over to prep data. We've got some imports. We've got an embedding model. 

199
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:17,910
We're querying through articles. That's the JSON documents. And we're running an 

200
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:22,680
embeddings against them. So we're getting the vector data from this and storing it 

201
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:30,480
into a different client. And what else have we got going on here. If the collection 

202
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:36,630
exists delete it. Otherwise create the collection and then upsert the data. Let's 

203
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:40,920
see if this works. So I ran this a couple of times and I got a few errors. But one 

204
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:46,830
of the things I tried was just trying to hit the collections here. I believe the 

205
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:49,710
data is in, so let's just see if I can get this working.

206
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:54,370
So we'll come over to our documentation and we've got this new concept called the 

207
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:59,830
Support Bot. This is an example of a customer service bot which includes a user interface 

208
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:05,830
agent and a help center agent. So they're represented here. Help center agent can 

209
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:11,320
query documents, submit a ticket, send an email, and transfer to the help center 

210
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:15,850
agent, which is itself, I'm assuming. So there must be other subagents going on here. 

211
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:20,500
And then we've got the support agent also querying, submitting tickets and sending 

212
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:26,740
an email. So the idea of the support agent is to handle interactions with the user, 

213
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:32,470
called for general support. Issues that aren't handled by other agents, can query 

214
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:37,660
the documentation, submit a ticket, and send an email. If we move on down to the 

215
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:42,850
help center agent we've got. This deals with questions about OpenAI agents such as 

216
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:49,540
GPT models, Dall-E, and whisper, so we'll ask questions of that later. So let's give 

217
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:49,930
it a whirl.

218
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:54,630
So I think we'll use it before looking at the code. This time I'm just going to say 

219
00:16:54,660 --> 00:17:00,120
I'm David and see what it comes up with. Could you please provide more context or 

220
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:11,400
specify a query related to David? Well, I would like to know the time in Chiang Mai, 

221
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:16,260
Thailand, which is currently where I'm living. So Chiang Mai, Thailand.

222
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:23,460
And hopefully that uses a general sort of bot the local time in Chiang Mai, Thailand 

223
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:23,730
is currently 

224
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:30,230
seven hours ahead of Coordinated Universal Time or UTC. Please check your local time 

225
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:33,260
to add time differences. Well that's great. 

226
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:41,350
can I ask questions about ChatGPT or OpenAI 

227
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,190
It should have documents related to 

228
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:50,330
how do I write a prompt for Dall-E three.

229
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:55,320
It says creating a prompt for Dall-E three. The AI model designed to generate images 

230
00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:02,970
from text descriptions involves clear and descriptive help. So we've got be specific 

231
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:12,300
clear language include style and medium, etc.. Okay, how do I make an API call to 

232
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:16,560
the completions API for chat?

233
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,530
And we've had a whole lot of information come through. 

234
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:25,800
Set up your environment pip install requests, obtain an API call, write your API 

235
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:30,510
calls. Now what are we working with? We're working with the user interface agent 

236
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:36,780
in this case. So I'm not sure whether a second agent has come into play. I reckon 

237
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,340
we should have a look at the code now.

238
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:44,500
So I've come over to the main.py file here we've got query the vector store. We've 

239
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:50,560
got query docs. And then we've got a couple of handoff functions send emails, submit 

240
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:56,260
ticket and transfer to the help center. Then the user interface agent, which was 

241
00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:01,540
where I was at. So that wasn't doing anything to communicate with the database from 

242
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:06,460
what I can tell. And if we look at the help center agent, which is where we need 

243
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:11,620
to be, this is where we can query docs, submit a ticket, or send an email. 

244
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:14,430
maybe let's try and get to the help center agent.

245
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:20,600
We're back at our chat client, so we'll say transfer me to the help center. I don't 

246
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:25,250
know whether I need the word agent. I probably shouldn't need it. And let's see if 

247
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:30,320
that changes. So now we're on a help center agent. Seems that a transfer function 

248
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:36,860
is not available at the current stage. However, I can assist you with issues directly. 

249
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:41,210
Can I submit a ticket around

250
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,580
errors

251
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:48,460
with vector store, which was what I was dealing with earlier? So the main thing I'm 

252
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:52,870
trying to do is see whether the submission ticket system works. It says your ticket 

253
00:19:52,870 --> 00:20:01,150
regarding errors has been successfully entered. Can I search for articles

254
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,30
on open AI?

255
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:11,850
we will go with the voice API, see what it says. Searching for knowledge, retrieving

256
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:17,490
so it looks like it worked. If we just grab this searching knowledge base for query 

257
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:22,420
and we do a search in here, we can see it popping up OpenAI voice API and it's come 

258
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:30,390
up with some information. Let's just go back to main agent, see what happens.

259
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:39,210
We're still with the help center agent. Let's go back to user interface agent. See 

260
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:40,820
if we can go back that far.

261
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:45,880
And we can't. That's okay. And exit won't do anything I don't believe.

262
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:49,150
Have a great day. It gives us a message. So that's pretty cool.

263
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:53,270
So I did have a couple of configuration issues with the support bot, but did get 

264
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:57,860
it up and running. Things like the personal shopper and customer service I didn't 

265
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:03,920
use. But let's have a look at basic. And we've got these little scripts that you 

266
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:08,00
can run. We'll just move a couple of them into focus so you can see what's going 

267
00:21:08,00 --> 00:21:12,740
on. And the last one is called function calling. I believe we can run them all one 

268
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:13,550
at a time.

269
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:17,310
So looking at these individually, they're just simple scripts. We've got the agent 

270
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:22,710
handoff where we've got English and Spanish. And one of the things going on is there's 

271
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:30,270
a transfer to Spanish being called by the English agent. So if we come down here 

272
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:36,360
and type in agent Handoff and run it, let's see what we get that's coming through. 

273
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,100
Hola. I don't know how to say Spanish. 

274
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:45,330
Let's move on to the next one. So we've got bare minimum. So let's go Python and 

275
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:50,970
we'll type in bare minimum. And what have we got here. How can I assist you today. 

276
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:53,160
So that's really all it's saying. 

277
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:58,860
we can see that the function calling is just an agent. That's helpful. And it will 

278
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:02,910
delegate responsibility to a function. And the function will just return some JSON 

279
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:03,540
data. 

280
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,140
if we run that 

281
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:10,990
the weather in New York is currently 67°F. Fahrenheit. This is great. Let's just 

282
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:14,530
move into this last one called Context variables. 

283
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:19,220
So we've got this context variables here. And there's two key value pairs. So let's 

284
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:26,480
change one of them. We'll go name is AppyDave and user ID is 555. And what happens 

285
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:31,490
is we've got this instructions coming through. And instructions now is not a string. 

286
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:37,940
Instead it's a function. And it's taking in the context variables. So we can grab 

287
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:43,550
the user which should be AppyDave you are a helpful agent, greet the user by name. 

288
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:48,770
It should be AppyDave. And if I'm understanding this correctly, we're just going 

289
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:53,900
to run two different responses sequentially. So the first one should be a greeting. 

290
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:59,600
The next one should be the account details. So let's hit save on that. We'll come 

291
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,710
over to here and we'll run the context variables script. 

292
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:08,960
Hello AppyDave. How can I assist you today? Account details. AppyDave 555.

293
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:15,600
So that's OpenAI lightweight multi-agent framework called Swarm. It's experimental 

294
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:21,600
at the moment, 4900 stars. Actually, let's just refresh that. It's already gone to 

295
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:28,830
5100 stars since I started recording this about two hours ago. So the next video 

296
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:34,530
I'm going to do is hooking up my Agent Workflow Builder into Swarm so that I can 

297
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:40,170
automate the stuff that I usually do manually. So this is a workflow that I'll use 

298
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:44,490
very soon. To publish this video, we'll work through the script, we'll work through 

299
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:45,810
the thumbnails, stuff like that.

300
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:50,560
I'm AppyDave. Please like and subscribe and I'll see you in the next video.
