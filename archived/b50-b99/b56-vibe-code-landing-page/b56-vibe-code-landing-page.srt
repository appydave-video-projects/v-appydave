1
00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:04,630
AI is all the rage. And you've decided that you want to create a little business 

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:09,510
around something to do with AI and thought, I need a website, I need a landing page. 

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:14,240
And now you're researching. Should I use Wix? Should I use WordPress? How do I create 

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,30
this? In this video, what I'd like to do is see if we can use three simple little 

5
00:00:19,30 --> 00:00:24,520
prompts, a little bit of prompt engineering and vibe coding, and create our own landing 

6
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,880
page for a brand new business. I'm AppyDave,. Let's get into it.

7
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,850
Vibe coding is getting really powerful in the last couple of months. We're seeing 

8
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:38,230
an influx of people doing videos around this topic here at couple. I've done on building 

9
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:43,900
application shells recently. You can check out these videos over on my YouTube channel, 

10
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,930
but I've also been using it to work through React and Tailwind Componentry. This 

11
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:54,280
was a little application I put together yesterday and in the last week I've been 

12
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:59,430
working on this application that uses ai. We can press little buttons here to preload 

13
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:05,170
it with data, and as it works through, it can go off to external systems like N8N 

14
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:11,530
this application will go off and use AI to get questions relating to an incident 

15
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,00
in a medical situation.

16
00:01:13,00 --> 00:01:18,240
Now. The client for that project came to me yesterday, gave me a few pieces of information, 

17
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,760
such as a logo and a couple of supporting documents and said, can you turn this into 

18
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,240
a website landing page? 

19
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:29,200
And so today that's what we're going to try and do using just three prompts.

20
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,780
So I think for today I am just going to go into ChatGTP and just get a starter conversation 

21
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:40,260
going on with the main ideas. So if I was building a landing page for a new business 

22
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:46,150
in HTML and Tailwind CSS, this is all the technology that I've said is available 

23
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:46,840
at the moment 

24
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:52,750
We need an agent or a person who is skilled in the art of making landing pages for 

25
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:55,530
websites, they understand marketing, that sort of stuff. 

26
00:01:55,810 --> 00:02:00,430
the next thing we would need is the business or marketing collateral. So the information 

27
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:03,150
about the company or the business that we're trying to 

28
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:07,680
promote on the website. And the last thing we need to know is what would be the requirements 

29
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,840
document for the landing page? What would be the structure of the site? So I'm just 

30
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,60
going to put this information in and press enter for now. 

31
00:02:16,60 --> 00:02:21,720
And what that's done is given us a breakdown of those three areas in just better 

32
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,580
writing than I could have done through the inputs. So we've got this role or agent 

33
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:32,500
definition, which is a marketing landing page designer. We've got the skills required 

34
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,900
for that particular entity. 

35
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,560
Now we've got the sort of information we should collect. I don't know that I'm gonna 

36
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,980
have it all, but we've got brand identity, like the logo. We do have colors and fonts. 

37
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:45,630
I don't have that at the moment. Don't currently have a mission and vision. I think. 

38
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:49,600
I haven't actually read all the documents and I don't think that matters too much. 

39
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:53,620
What you really wanna do is the better the information you have available, you just 

40
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:57,180
feed it all in. But this is the sort of information you're trying to come up with. 

41
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:02,530
And then the last one is, what would a requirements document or a product requirements 

42
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:07,300
document look like and the structure? So we've got all this information here. We're 

43
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:11,250
not going to implement it all. We're going to let AI do a lot of the work and we're 

44
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,290
just gonna vibe code something that we're happy with. 

45
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:19,260
So because this is a video and we're doing things visually, I just turned that information 

46
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:23,810
firstly into a PowerPoint presentation so I can describe it better to you. We need 

47
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:28,60
an agent role definition. We need business marketing collateral. And we're going 

48
00:03:28,60 --> 00:03:29,740
to need a requirements document.

49
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:34,530
And I'm showing you this because when you're coding keep in mind that all the marketing 

50
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:39,780
imagery you want is as simple as taking the information and just shaping it into 

51
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:45,620
a picture of a particular style. This particular image I just said create image 1609 

52
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:51,570
aspect ratio. Use the Golden Age of Comics as the style that represents. And I said 

53
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:55,250
the three part section above as if it was a PowerPoint presentation.

54
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:59,980
Now, the first prompt that I want to create is going to be a persona. So the way 

55
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:05,380
we'll do that is we will just select the information it has right here. And I've 

56
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:09,700
just started. Can you take the following information and turn it into a persona. 

57
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,740
We'll paste it in and we'll just press enter on that.

58
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:18,500
So starting to write out information that we'll use in a variety of vibe coding environments. 

59
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:23,690
Now we have a persona document has been created. What I like to do here is just go 

60
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:29,170
into canvas mode. This information, we could use it from any number of vibe coding 

61
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:34,290
tools, but we just copy the information. We can close that down. Head over to VS 

62
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:39,170
code in this case. And I've just set up three blank documents. So the one we're starting 

63
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:41,770
off with is going to be the persona. 

64
00:04:42,10 --> 00:04:46,810
we can see all the information that's there. We could edit it over here if we wanted 

65
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:47,250
to.

66
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:52,660
So the next thing we want to do is go and have a look at these documents. We've got 

67
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:59,860
two PDFs and a word document, and I'll just take us back to our GPT window. And essentially 

68
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:04,620
I want to build this area using that information. So I've just started a prompt that 

69
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:09,980
says can you develop a detailed overview of the company information using the attached 

70
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:13,860
documents? I'm also going to just paste in this regular information.

71
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:18,980
Now if we bring up the folder view that we had earlier, we can see these three documents. 

72
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:23,340
And hopefully we can just drag them in here. They're now attached and they're loading 

73
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:29,220
into memory. What I'd like it to do is read through all of these and apply the information, 

74
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:35,140
and just see if we can get a detailed brief related to this particular organisation.

75
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:40,20
So that's just finished creating the information. We've got the company, it's called 

76
00:05:40,20 --> 00:05:46,110
Supporting Signal. We've got a mission and a vision. We've got brand identity pillars, 

77
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:50,880
taglines, visual identity. So it looks like we don't have colors. 

78
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:56,760
edit this document dynamically here to adding some colors that make sense for this 

79
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:02,460
sort of organization. We've got a target audience personas, we've got social proof, 

80
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:07,680
differentiation, and we've got a little bit of existing information. 

81
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:12,660
I think for the colors, we should just be able to go back to the logo, which already 

82
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:18,270
has some colors in it. Well, we'll just add that in there and say, can you extract 

83
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,340
branding colors 

84
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,420
from logo? 

85
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,220
And we might also say, 

86
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:26,940
I've also added a little bit. You can add more branding colors 

87
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,980
if you think it makes sense. 

88
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:34,990
So we've got new colors being created. Now let's go and turn everything into a document. 

89
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:39,370
So I've just said, can you create brand details document using the recommended color 

90
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:45,70
palette from the AI's point of view? Plus I'm just gonna paste in the rest of the 

91
00:06:45,70 --> 00:06:50,50
information that we had above. And this should turn it into a Canvas document. Start 

92
00:06:50,50 --> 00:06:54,760
writing everything. There's a little button at the top of this where I can press 

93
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:58,990
copy and we'll just move it directly over to the file system. 

94
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:04,620
So here's our document. We'll go and press copy, go back to Visual Studio in this 

95
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:08,920
case, and we'll click on the brand details document and just paste everything in 

96
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,610
and save it.

97
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:13,960
So the last piece in the puzzle is to create a requirements document that we can 

98
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:18,870
use. Now, we do need to be careful that whatever we create right now doesn't get 

99
00:07:19,60 --> 00:07:24,490
too influenced by the other two documents we've done. The role and the marketing 

100
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:29,430
collateral, mainly because we have detailed information there, it's in this conversation, 

101
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,150
but when we use it in another tool, I'll be using Claude Code, but it could be replit, 

102
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:39,870
it could be cursor. They are already provided as tangible finished documents. 

103
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:43,540
so what I've done is started a prompt that says, can you create a requirements document 

104
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:50,920
for me? The project is pure HTML and Tailwind CSS landing page. No JavaScript frameworks 

105
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:56,760
or backend logic. Keep the tech minimal and focused. Now, I've also said this prompt 

106
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:01,890
is being used in a separate chat bot and already has access to the two supporting 

107
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:06,00
documents, which is the brand details and the persona document that we've just talked 

108
00:08:06,00 --> 00:08:11,370
about. You can let these documents inspire the structure, but don't integrate it. 

109
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:15,150
So in this case, it's a little bit fuzzy. I would write this prompt a little bit 

110
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:20,850
differently if I was going to do the actual vibe coating inside ChatGTP, but in this 

111
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,620
case, I'm just preparing documents. 

112
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:27,610
I might also just take the original information that was right here and throw it 

113
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:32,920
down the bottom. You can use this and we'll paste it in 

114
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:36,660
and let's see what sort of a requirements document it produces for us. 

115
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:41,250
So we've got a detailed document with the project scope. The technology is listed. 

116
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:45,540
It looks like the page is going to have a hero, which is the main image at the top 

117
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:50,670
of the website. We've got some features who, it's for compliance and intelligence 

118
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:51,180
section. 

119
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:55,770
this is for government sponsored programs. So this is important. We've got testimonials, 

120
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:01,110
frequently asked questions, and a call to action and footer. We've got all the layout, 

121
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:06,300
SEO media and assets. I think we've even got the location of the file. So a simple 

122
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:10,770
HTML file with simple CSS and an assets folder. 

123
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:15,250
So we'll just copy the information and we'll go down to our requirements document 

124
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,920
and we'll paste everything in.

125
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:21,760
Now I plan to do a few versions of the landing page, and I'll do it from a few different 

126
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:26,360
techniques. So we'll start off in regular Claude at the moment and put in a prompt 

127
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,760
that says, can you become. Now what do we want to become? We want to become the persona 

128
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:36,880
that we set up earlier. So if we go over and drag the persona into here and press 

129
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,320
go, 

130
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:42,480
it's loading in, the idea of what a marketing landing page designer really encompasses.

131
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:48,800
Next we'll put in a simple prompt will go. Can you absorb branding design guidelines? 

132
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:53,400
We're waiting for further instructions. We'll go back down to our files. This time. 

133
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,640
We'll put in the brand details

134
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:00,640
and we'll just let that come in. So now we've loaded up this clean conversation with 

135
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:05,800
two useful pieces of information. One is an employee of sorts, 

136
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:10,880
a web designer, in this case. And we've loaded in all of the details around the brand.

137
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:16,00
And the last prompt is, can you create a website using brand details that we've already 

138
00:10:16,00 --> 00:10:20,480
inputted and the following requirements. And we can just drag that information in 

139
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,760
and press go. And what it should start to do is create an artifact for us and start 

140
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,240
generating the code over on the right. One of the things that we can see here is 

141
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,960
that we've got tailwind CSS. This actually might be a little bit problematic, because 

142
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:41,00
I find this particular CDN implementation not to be the best. So we may need to change 

143
00:10:41,00 --> 00:10:47,40
that. But at the moment it's just writing all the HTML. We need to do some sort of 

144
00:10:47,40 --> 00:10:51,920
visual landing page. And this will change every time you do it. So the good thing 

145
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,840
about this technique is that you can run it multiple times, and I'll show you a better 

146
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:01,360
way of doing that soon so that you can test different iterations.

147
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,320
So it failed to create. And it's happened because of an uncaught reference error 

148
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,640
to tailwind. I see this fairly regularly, and when I went to go into fix mode, it 

149
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:16,960
just randomly did 6 or 7 tests. That all failed, and I had to give it a little bit 

150
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:21,800
of instructions. And on the ninth one it did work. And so we've got this landing 

151
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:28,00
page that's been created correctly. It's following the branding guidelines that it 

152
00:11:28,00 --> 00:11:29,680
assumed would be the right way to go. 

153
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:34,440
I think we could play around with colors a fair bit, but let's test a couple more 

154
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,680
ways of generating this same landing page with other tools.

155
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:43,810
So to test out the next technique, we'll just go to a clean ChatGTP window and I'll 

156
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:48,190
say, I'll give you three documents. I want you to become the persona. I want you 

157
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:52,540
to read and understand the brand details for the client. And lastly, I want you to 

158
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:57,760
create a simple HTML page using the requirements I've also just said for reinforcement, 

159
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:03,460
in other words, as persona rebrand details and create HTML following the requirements. 

160
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:09,160
And if we pop on down to our file system before where we had these files, we should 

161
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:14,890
be able to just drag them in. Once they've loaded, we can just press go and hopefully 

162
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:19,810
it'll start writing html and we'll be able to visualize it in ChatGTP. 

163
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:25,870
So it started writing index html. Maybe it's something that we've gotta bring down 

164
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:33,160
to Visual Studio to edit and run from. One of the things I noticed high up is that 

165
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:39,100
we've got Tailwind CSS, but we don't actually have a link to it to A CDN. So this 

166
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:43,870
wouldn't run the way it is right now. We also don't even have these icons, so things 

167
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:47,590
will be a little bit different when running it this way. And quite frankly, it's 

168
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:51,640
a very small HTML file. So let's just see 

169
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:58,330
what would happen if we just go into the edit mode. So from edit mode, we can actually 

170
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:02,590
preview it. There's a little button up in the top right hand corner, and so we can 

171
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:05,710
see that none of the CSS has come through for us. 

172
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:07,840
So I'm just gonna test whether I can bring this 

173
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:14,830
alignment and working directly from ChatGTP, I've just said, can you make this complete? 

174
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:19,540
In other words, can you replace the asset icons that we had, which were images with 

175
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,520
just scalable vetor graphics? 

176
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:26,170
And can we make sure that the CSS is calling A CDN? 

177
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:29,980
And we'll just run that. It'll rewrite the code for us. 

178
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:34,190
We can see the scalable veto graphics being drawn here and here. I don't know what 

179
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:38,140
shape they are, they're just a bunch of mathematical numbers from my point of view 

180
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,80
at the moment. 

181
00:13:39,80 --> 00:13:45,720
Now, like in Claude, we had similar issues with the tailwind CSS showing up, so I 

182
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:50,120
just gave it a screenshot and said what are the suggestions? Came up with a few. 

183
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:54,750
I said, can you just use the recommended change and rewrote it for us? And what that 

184
00:13:54,750 --> 00:14:00,440
means is that if we hit play on this particular one, we now do have a working version 

185
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,720
on the screen. It's a little bit different to the other. 

186
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,840
But now let's go to the last technique, which I prefer to use over these two. 

187
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:12,160
which is to use Claude Code. So I've come down to Visual Studio. We've got our three 

188
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:17,50
files that we're interested in here, and I'm just going to open up a terminal. 

189
00:14:17,50 --> 00:14:22,450
with the terminal open, I can start typing Claude and this will open up, we can initialize 

190
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:26,250
it, we can do options, but I'm just going to use it the way it is right now and start 

191
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,220
writing a prompt. 

192
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:33,310
So I've just said, can you become, I'll put in the at symbol and I'll start writing 

193
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,920
persona and that becomes available. 

194
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:41,110
Then I say using the brand details again. I put in the at sign, I start typing brand. 

195
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:46,00
I've said create a HTML file called, we can put in anything we want. We can even 

196
00:14:46,00 --> 00:14:50,380
use the at symbol, even though it won't make a lot of sense 'cause it doesn't exist 

197
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:55,330
right now. I'll do index one point HTML in this case. And the reason I'm doing the 

198
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:59,500
one is we should be able to create two, three, and four and see different look and 

199
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,870
feel. And the last thing we should write here 

200
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:07,360
is follow the requirements. So at that point we can just start typing requirements. 

201
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:11,140
There's the document and we press enter. And press go. 

202
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:16,00
So now it's reading all three files and coming up with a plan of action for what 

203
00:15:16,00 --> 00:15:21,160
it wants to do. It says I'll create a marketing landing page for support signal using 

204
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,890
the brand details and the requirements provided. 

205
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:28,420
And now it has a list of steps that it's going to work through. We've got creating 

206
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,890
the HTML structure.

207
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:35,530
So it's created the code. It's asking if I want to write it into the system. So we've 

208
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:39,490
got this new file called index one html going on, 

209
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:41,200
and it says it's finished everything. 

210
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:45,730
It's told us everything it's done. If we right click on the file and I've got live 

211
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:50,260
server available, so I can click on that button there and here we have it. 

212
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:55,450
One of the things I find about Claude Code over the last two techniques that we used, 

213
00:15:55,450 --> 00:16:01,120
which was ChatGTP plus, and the Claude conversation window as well, is that this 

214
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:06,190
tends to work every time and the quality of the output tends to be a lot better. 

215
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:11,140
This is using the Opus model. In this particular case, we're on index number one. 

216
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:16,660
even things work. So I clicked on a button and we saw start your free trial. 

217
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:22,720
Now for the next example, we'll create index two and we'll start typing in Claude 

218
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,880
again. But this time I'm going to put in a model and I'm going to use the sonnet 

219
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:35,50
model. So if we pop this up like this and kick it off, where still in Claude, we're 

220
00:16:35,50 --> 00:16:38,770
just doing it from a different location. And I'm gonna paste in a prompt that says, 

221
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:43,900
can you become persona, the same brand details, the same requirements only? We're 

222
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:49,570
going to put it into index number two, so it's gonna go through the same thing all 

223
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:50,80
over again. 

224
00:16:50,80 --> 00:16:56,140
Now as that happens, we'll have our visual studio coming up. We can see everything 

225
00:16:56,140 --> 00:17:01,150
running down in the bottom right hand corner. And hopefully a new file called index 

226
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,770
two will get generated here. 

227
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:07,450
When we look at it in the terminal, it's got all similar stuff to before, but it 

228
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:12,60
will change things around. We could have even used a little bit of a custom instruction 

229
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:16,50
to do something fancy, and we might do that with the third example. 

230
00:17:16,50 --> 00:17:20,500
So it's got all the information. It started writing a new file, 

231
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:27,600
So I'll right click on the index two and we can open it up. And here we have it. 

232
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:33,60
Now it looks very similar. If we go down the bottom, let's look at them side by side 

233
00:17:33,60 --> 00:17:35,230
here with the other version that we had 

234
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,600
slightly different 

235
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,650
and we come back.

236
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:43,770
So we'll right click and open up index two. And here it is. If we look at it compared 

237
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:45,10
to index one 

238
00:17:45,10 --> 00:17:50,50
it the same way. It's called from reactive reporting to reformative intelligence. 

239
00:17:50,90 --> 00:17:55,210
If we look down at FAQ in number two and we move down, we've got FAQ. Again, it's 

240
00:17:55,210 --> 00:18:00,490
slightly different and we've got a different way of doing the email sign up down 

241
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:01,90
the bottom.

242
00:18:01,90 --> 00:18:06,130
So for our final test, we'll just do something a little bit different. I've got exactly 

243
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:11,570
the same prompt in the same conversation. This time I've called it index three, which 

244
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:17,90
makes sense, but I want to give it more of a Christmas feel. So I'll just say it's 

245
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:22,890
Christmas. And we have decided that the landing page needs a Christmas feel. So let's 

246
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:24,650
see what it does the third time.

247
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:29,990
So it's got our to-dos. It's a little bit different because we're going to structure 

248
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:32,180
it with festive elements. 

249
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:37,40
We're also going to have brand colors plus the Christmas color accents. 

250
00:18:37,40 --> 00:18:41,300
Now if you're wondering how long this should take, I'm finding that it's taking somewhere 

251
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:46,280
between two to three minutes to generate these pages. But it is a one shot, it gets 

252
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,360
it right each time 

253
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,710
So that's finished. We'll go over to Visual Studio. We've got a third file. When 

254
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:55,850
we look through, we've got some colors and look at that. We're starting to see concepts 

255
00:18:55,850 --> 00:19:01,640
like animations. We've got Christmas reds. What happens if we go to the web on this? 

256
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,850
And it's still our brand colors, but we've now got 

257
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:08,540
Christmas trees, we've got presents, we've got snowflakes, we've got some sort of 

258
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:13,730
border going around. Let's see, and the color of all the panels have all changed 

259
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:19,70
quite a bit. Now this was created from scratch, so normally you wouldn't do it this 

260
00:19:19,70 --> 00:19:24,500
way. Normally you might say modify the existing structure to have the Christmas feel. 

261
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,190
But 

262
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:29,210
this worked pretty powerful. But this has worked pretty well. I love this.

263
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:35,730
So to recap, we essentially used three prompts. We had the agent definition role. 

264
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:41,690
So who was going to be building the website for us. We then had our marketing collateral, 

265
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:46,130
our branding information, our second brain. And that could be any information that 

266
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:51,410
you want to see going into the website. And lastly, we did the requirements. We tested 

267
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:58,130
it on Claude OpenAI, ChatGPT plus and Claude Code,. And with the Claude Code,, we 

268
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:02,370
were able to do three different variations, including a Christmas version.

269
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:06,890
Now if you're interested in working one on one with me with Vibe coding, you can 

270
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:11,770
come and book a call through that. We can arrange some time to work together, but
