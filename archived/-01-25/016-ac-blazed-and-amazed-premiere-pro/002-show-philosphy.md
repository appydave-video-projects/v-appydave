"Blazed and Amazed" is a fusion of mystery-solving, comedic stoner culture, and a fresh, youthful narrative, drawing influence from classic and contemporary characters. The show features neurodivergent protagonists who are both endearing and adept at solving crimes.

Dex and Oz, with their knack for accidentally discovering real crimes while high, mirror this dynamic. Scooby Dooâ€™s influence can be seen in the show's humor and the camaraderie among the characters. The iconic van can inspire Dex and Oz's mode of transportation, which itself could be a character with its quirks and charm.

Like Enola, Dex and Oz are not afraid to challenge societal norms and can use their unique perspectives to their advantage.
