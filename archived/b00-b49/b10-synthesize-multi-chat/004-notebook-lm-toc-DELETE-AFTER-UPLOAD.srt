I used NotebookLM on one of my projects to create this table of content, where I 

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:10,910
went through a bunch of the files I had and it created this nice structure for me. 

3
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,500
Let me show you how I did that.

4
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:17,280
So here we have a docs directory. And within that folder we've got a whole lot of 

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:22,250
requirements documents in markdown format. And what we want to do is create a table 

6
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,200
of content for the fly video application.

7
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:30,360
Now. I wrote this simple prompt for the outline and the Toc, but before I did that, 

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,950
I dragged all the files into the sources. We can see them on the left, and then we 

9
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:39,450
just see the brands and the breakdown of brands. We've got the command line interface 

10
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,950
and the breakdown of that, and all this information can now be copied back into my 

11
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,350
requirements document.

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,880
