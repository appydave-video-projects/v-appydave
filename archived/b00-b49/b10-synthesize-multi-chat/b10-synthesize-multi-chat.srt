1
00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:06,120
Have you got conversations with ChatGPT or other large language models spread across 

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,950
many chat windows for the same project? And you're thinking, how can I get this all 

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:16,80
together in one cohesive and coherent document in this video? That's the problem 

4
00:00:16,80 --> 00:00:18,810
we're exploring. I'm AppyDave. Let's get into it.

5
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:24,600
In the last video, we looked at this moderately complex document, which goes over 

6
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:29,700
a long chat window and thought, how do we bring this all together so that we have 

7
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:35,130
one single document? Now in that video we used three different techniques. We did 

8
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,580
the cherry pick the one shot prompt and we used notebook.

9
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:44,890
This video extends that idea. But now it's working for multi conversational chat 

10
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:50,710
projects. So in this case we've got a project called FliVideo. We've got many conversations 

11
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:55,540
some of which are almost the same but with slight differences. We need to create 

12
00:00:55,540 --> 00:01:00,220
a second brain so that I have one source of truth for the project. We're going to 

13
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:04,120
use some of the techniques that we talked about in the last video, plus bring in 

14
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,20
new ones.

15
00:01:05,30 --> 00:01:09,590
Now let's get started with the first document. Now this is the conversation we worked 

16
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:14,960
with yesterday. And we created three different variations. These two were both excellent 

17
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,780
but we'll work with the one shot prompt version. And from there we have this Readme 

18
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:24,850
document that I created all with one single prompt. And what we'll do is we'll just 

19
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:28,840
copy that and we'll head over to notebook LM, because this is where we're going to 

20
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,780
bring all this information into a single document. 

21
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:35,930
what we'll do is click on the Create New button. And from there we'll just copy some 

22
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:40,880
text in and we'll paste this information. And so now we've got our first document 

23
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,10
going into notebook LM.

24
00:01:43,30 --> 00:01:48,280
Now, I know that this document is about project naming requirements for my YouTube 

25
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:53,290
videos, so I've just renamed it here. And what we'll want to do is add another source. 

26
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:55,60
But where are we going to get that. 

27
00:01:55,60 --> 00:01:59,760
we'll come back over to the projects that are listed and we'll look through here. 

28
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,540
And I know that there's another document right at the bottom called 

29
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:09,130
Fli Project New Digital Asset Management. And I suspect that the information in this 

30
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:12,970
conversation is very similar to the information that was in this. 

31
00:02:13,00 --> 00:02:16,950
what we'll do is use the same technique as yesterday and consolidate it.

32
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:23,390
what we'll do is go into the Fli new project and we can see it's quite a long conversation 

33
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:28,250
where I started off having regular voice conversations with it. And from there it 

34
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:33,470
started creating complex requirements documents. And what we can do is go and click 

35
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:38,780
on our GPT conversation extractor, and now we have a copy of that in the clipboard. 

36
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:43,20
Now we wanna create a new chat, but we can't use this button because we're in a project. 

37
00:02:43,20 --> 00:02:47,250
So we'll click on the project instead. And we're just gonna paste in everything from 

38
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:52,560
that document. And we can see we've got the user and assistant interactions going 

39
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:52,830
on 

40
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:56,930
And we just need to prefix it with a prompt that we did in the previous video that 

41
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:02,300
says, summarize and synthesize our conversation into a coherent document. 

42
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:07,220
prioritizing the information is, which is basically at the end of the document, but 

43
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:11,810
still keeping in mind the insights from early in the document. And we'll just press 

44
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:12,740
enter on that. 

45
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,750
And that's now in the middle of building another project management requirements 

46
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:22,190
document, which will have a lot of similarities to the document we just looked at. 

47
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:25,670
But there should be differences because it was done a few weeks later.

48
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:30,740
So we've pulled together our second document and it has similarities, but it's actually 

49
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:35,270
quite a different document to the one on the right. Let's talk about the similarities. 

50
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:40,670
So the similarities is that when a project is created for my videos, I'll put in 

51
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:46,220
a sequence for the project. I'll have a channel code. Is it for AppyDave or a TLDR? 

52
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:49,940
And I have the name of the project, which is essentially the name of the video. Now, 

53
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:54,290
when we look through the document on the left, we can see there are similar concepts 

54
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:59,630
going on, but this goes in a totally different direction. It talks about creating 

55
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:05,60
new projects, renaming projects, it's talking about listing projects. And it also 

56
00:04:05,60 --> 00:04:09,890
brings in a new terminology called business unit. So where it was called channel 

57
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:14,990
code, here it becomes business unit here, which makes a lot more sense to me. So 

58
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:18,320
it's one of the things I'm going to be thinking about as I bring it all together 

59
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,610
into one document.

60
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:24,600
So this is the second document for Notebook lm. So we'll just copy it from here, 

61
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:26,970
head over to notebook lm, 

62
00:04:27,00 --> 00:04:32,420
click on add source and we'll use copy text again and we'll just paste all the information 

63
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:38,210
in. We'll let it start reading that information. Now we need to get these names correct 

64
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:43,320
just for our own sanity. It doesn't necessarily matter too much from Notebook LM's 

65
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:44,240
point of view, 

66
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:50,130
go back to FliVideo the project. This was the document that we just consolidated. 

67
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:55,710
So I might just rename this for now and call it old because it's not actually relevant 

68
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,230
other than from an archival point of view. 

69
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:03,980
I've renamed it as Fly Project CLI tool. So what we'll do is we'll grab that name, 

70
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,450
we'll come in over here 

71
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,940
and we'll rename this source to that value as well. 

72
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,10
so now we've got project naming for individual videos that I'm creating and we've 

73
00:05:14,10 --> 00:05:15,780
got the command line tool.

74
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:20,580
Now I found another document similar to this one, which I've just called Fli Project 

75
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:25,830
CLI Tool More. I've also made sure it's in, I went through, I found a document that 

76
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:28,110
didn't have any information, so I've deleted it. 

77
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:33,120
next, I'm just going to go and look at this document and there's a bunch of information 

78
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,790
that was used to build an ASCI diagram. So I think for this, we'll just copy that 

79
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:43,110
information individually because the rest of the information is just a little bit 

80
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:46,500
confusing if we put it into our second brain. 

81
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:51,240
So we're just cherry picking the information there and adding it in as a new source. 

82
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,400
And we will rename it as we go. 

83
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,470
we have a simple document called FliVideo Entity Relationship Diagram.

84
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,520
Now based on the techniques for gathering a conversation that I talked about in the 

85
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:07,520
last video, we've been using the one shot prompt technique the most. We just used 

86
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,500
the cherry pick technique when we just grabbed the ERD, but now we're going to use 

87
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,180
the NotebookLM 

88
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,920
and the reason for that is we've got this fly brief conversation and when we go into 

89
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,970
it, we've got a bunch of information that was used to start the conversation. 

90
00:06:22,00 --> 00:06:24,640
There's also images at one stage 

91
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:29,970
In the document, I built additional requirements. And all of this information is 

92
00:06:30,30 --> 00:06:32,610
just too much to use the one shop prompt. 

93
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:36,560
so what we'll do is we'll go to the top of the document and we'll use the little 

94
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,660
tool that I created that allows me to extract a conversation and we'll head over 

95
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,70
to Notebook lm, 

96
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:48,330
and we'll use this to clean it up. Now, there is the option of creating a new notebook 

97
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:53,460
because this is just one document that I need to get into alignment, but because 

98
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:59,700
we can actually turn documents on and off, we can also do it here and just make sure 

99
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:04,470
that we're focusing on the information we need both right now and later on when we 

100
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:05,580
bring everything together.

101
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:10,480
So we'll start by adding a source. We'll go to the copy text. We'll paste everything 

102
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:15,580
in. And one of the things we can see is that there's both the user and the assistant 

103
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:18,160
being listed one after another.

104
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,590
we have our long raw document and I've actually named it raw. I've also made it the 

105
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:26,890
only one available at the moment. We'll paste in a prompt. It's 

106
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:31,360
a similar prompt of summarizing and synthesizing the document, but there's a little 

107
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:35,410
bit of information to let it know that there is an assistant, there is a user, 

108
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:40,70
With a little bit of extra context around the difference between an assistant and 

109
00:07:40,70 --> 00:07:43,700
a user. So we'll just start that and see what it comes up with.

110
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:47,960
So I had to look through the information here. It's essentially about creating a 

111
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:52,880
web application or a SaaS application. And what we'll do is we'll just go into a 

112
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:57,140
new chat. We'll say, turn this information into a requirements document. In this 

113
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:01,700
case we're going to use canvas. We'll paste in all the information. And what it should 

114
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:07,610
do is start writing a good requirements document based on all of that information 

115
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:09,260
from the previous chat.

116
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:14,160
So now we have a nice requirements document for a web application. It figures out 

117
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,330
all the different components to lay it out. There's information about the documents 

118
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:22,860
and the design. And down the bottom there's even branding guidelines. So we'll just 

119
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:29,610
copy this information and add it as a new source into notebook LM. Now this information 

120
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:35,190
that's being generated started from this one. So this one I'm going to disable. We 

121
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:38,760
won't use it again in the future because this is a better version.

122
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,430
And we just rename it and then turn everything else on except for the raw one.

123
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:48,600
And then I've just come back to ChatGPT and marked it as old while the new one is 

124
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,970
in place here. Now over time I will be coming through and archiving them. But for 

125
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:55,440
now, they've just got a label.

126
00:08:55,460 --> 00:09:00,770
So one of the conversations, the minimal UI design trends, was just an experiment 

127
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:06,350
where I had a look from the point of view of an image around a certain style called 

128
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:11,510
neomorphism. And so I just used the one shot prompt technique, and we've now got 

129
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:16,730
a document that we can add in. This may not be part of the final project, but at 

130
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:21,830
least this was an exploration of some style guides that I can include.

131
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:27,20
And now we're just onto the last conversation that I want to bring all together. 

132
00:09:27,20 --> 00:09:31,190
And I'll just use a different technique again, because when I looked through it, 

133
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:36,470
most of the information is in a relatively short conversation. The only thing missing 

134
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:40,790
is there's not a nice clean document at the end. So what we'll do is we'll just go 

135
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:45,800
into canvas mode with this and just say, read through the entire conversation. And 

136
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,880
I've just asked it to come up with a heading, write some requirements, think through 

137
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:54,710
some of the examples and the code, and we'll just let it build the documentation. 

138
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:57,110
This one document, when it's finished, 

139
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:03,00
is what I'll actually add into notebook LM. But I will keep this conversation just 

140
00:10:03,00 --> 00:10:05,160
as it is in ChatGPT.

141
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:10,310
So we've got a copy of this conversation. We've gone over to the notebook LM, we've 

142
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:15,350
put it in as Fli File Mover. If we click on that we can see all the information here. 

143
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,630
From now, we should be able to synthesize a complete document based on all the different 

144
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:23,480
information sources that we've collected 

145
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:27,730
back from our ChatGPT project called FliVideo.

146
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:33,120
So what I'd like to do now is create one consolidated conversation. So I've come 

147
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,400
through and I've marked everything with a tick except for the fly brief raw, because 

148
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,990
we have a better version of it here. And I've also cleared the chat window here. 

149
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:47,400
So we're starting from scratch. Now, we could start with a simple prompt that says 

150
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:53,310
create a consolidated document for the FliVideo SaaS application. And that's probably 

151
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:58,560
going to be okay. But maybe we can use Anthropic's prompt generator and come up with 

152
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,820
something a little bit more purpose built for this particular project.

153
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:06,620
So I've come over to Philanthropics Prompt Generator. I've said create a consolidated 

154
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:12,440
document based on six documents generally related to building a SaaS application. 

155
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:16,970
Make sure that you've got the appropriate hierarchy going on. Now I shouldn't need 

156
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:21,920
to understand what the hierarchy is because if we view the prompt, it will write 

157
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,50
a prompt that's going to make sense. 

158
00:11:24,60 --> 00:11:28,970
So we've got a strong opening. You are tasked with creating a consolidated document 

159
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:33,980
based on six different documents. Now there are actually more than that, so we are 

160
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:38,150
going to change that a little bit and we're probably going to strip out all the variables 

161
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:42,380
'cause that doesn't make sense for what we're doing with Notebook lm. But then it's 

162
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:47,780
got additional rules going on in that it can identify the main topics subtopics and 

163
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:53,30
also build an outline. So this will be a good starting prompt. We'll just copy all 

164
00:11:53,30 --> 00:11:53,930
this information 

165
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:58,740
and we'll come back to Notebook LM and just paste it all the way in. What we can 

166
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:03,870
do is just remove all these documents. A little modification here to say, provided 

167
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:06,180
sources, it shouldn't matter for what we're doing. 

168
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,900
And then the final part of this prompt is just formatting it as two parts to the 

169
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:15,430
document. I could do it as one part, but in this case I think I'll leave it the way 

170
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,650
it is and we'll just press go. I.

171
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:23,550
Now, one other thing to be aware of is that the size of this prompt is limited. So 

172
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:27,810
at the moment I can't actually click on the arrow. So we'll go to the very bottom 

173
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:32,610
and we'll get rid of the formatting. We don't need multiple document formats anyway, 

174
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:36,810
and we've given ourselves enough room that we can now run this. So let's kick it 

175
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:41,790
off. We've also made sure that the fly brief raw source has been turned off.

176
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:47,30
So at this point, we've got a strong outline of all the capabilities from all the 

177
00:12:47,30 --> 00:12:51,470
different sources, but we haven't gone detailed enough for the actual requirements 

178
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,40
document.

179
00:12:52,60 --> 00:12:57,20
So I've just said expand the structure into a detailed requirements document. I want 

180
00:12:57,50 --> 00:13:01,970
it to go deep into every source, make sure it can bring in all the rules, code examples, 

181
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:04,130
branding guidelines as we go, 

182
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,340
So it's expanded the information out for us. One of the things that you can notice 

183
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:13,200
is that it doesn't format code very well, but what you can do is come down and save 

184
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:18,360
a note, which I've done here. And we can see at least that there is code in here. 

185
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:24,960
And we will use this back in ChatGPT canvas to convert it back into a proper document 

186
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,160
that we can read.

187
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,720
back in a new chat, turn into a requirements document, paste everything in, click 

188
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,150
on canvas and let it go to work

189
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:37,230
That's done a pretty good job building up the document, but it's missing a few areas. 

190
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:40,770
So the first area that it hasn't gone deep enough into 

191
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:46,320
Is the CLI tool or the command line interface. So I've said can you go deeper into 

192
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,980
the CLI tool. And it's given me a bunch of information 

193
00:13:50,00 --> 00:13:53,750
you update the Readme using the following information. And we'll just paste in all 

194
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:59,780
the information that we queried out of notebook LM. So as it goes through it started 

195
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:03,830
updating a part of it. We've got the command line tool coming through here. And now 

196
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:07,640
we've got the functionality for the command line tool coming in. We've got create 

197
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,910
project rename and list projects.

198
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:16,840
Next, I want to update the document with the branding guidelines, and I got all this 

199
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:22,30
information directly from a query in notebook LM. Can you give me information about 

200
00:14:22,30 --> 00:14:22,840
brand guidelines? 

201
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:27,360
which means we're going to get the general color guidelines that are in the fly brief, 

202
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,980
but we're also going to get information about the neomorphism. So this information 

203
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:38,550
is being updated as we speak. General guidelines. The colors for the brand information 

204
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:42,330
around using soft UI principles is coming through as well.

205
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:47,40
Now, another big area of this document was going to be the naming of the rules and 

206
00:14:47,40 --> 00:14:53,280
projects for the application for the videos that I create. So we're letting that 

207
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:58,830
update and where I got this from was just asking the information. Can you go deep 

208
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:05,130
into the naming conventions of a single video project, a multi-episode project? How 

209
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:10,290
should recordings within a video get created? What about the chapter names? And there's 

210
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:14,970
also all these B-roll images for the thumbnail, the intro, the outro, the calls to 

211
00:15:15,00 --> 00:15:17,580
action. How is this all being dealt with? 

212
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,790
So this is now in the middle of updating. We've got project naming, episode naming, 

213
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:27,200
and a solid section on assets like the B-roll that I just mentioned.

214
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:32,760
Now we're looking at the file movement. So one of the concepts that this application 

215
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:38,190
is meant to solve is routing files from, say a downloads directory. If it's a Midjourney 

216
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:44,730
image or from OBS or Ecamm live or Camtasia, if it's a video directly into the appropriate 

217
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:49,950
video project or assets folder. So I've just gone through and asked that question. 

218
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:54,720
Tell me detailed information about how the file movement rules are meant to happen. 

219
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,190
Grab that information. And it's just been coming through to the document right now.

220
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:03,370
There is a lot more I want to do with this document, and I will proceed to do that. 

221
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:07,960
But we're at the end of this video, and I want to give a recap of the problems and 

222
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:13,120
the interesting concepts that came out here. So when I started this, I thought I 

223
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,890
was going to bring all the conversations into notebook LM, and it was going to create 

224
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:23,680
one big consolidated document for me. Now, it didn't do as good a job, especially 

225
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,470
in the formatting as what I wanted,

226
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:31,410
but it certainly wasn't a loss because where it excelled was that if I needed to 

227
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,910
query on any part of the documents in the sources, it gave me detailed information 

228
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:42,180
that way. And so, as you saw, I was able to construct a complete document using canvas 

229
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:47,730
from ChatGPT by just pulling in the parts of the documents that I knew it was missing.

230
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:52,760
Now, this video about gathering all this requirements document serves a purpose. 

231
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:57,110
In the next video, where we're going to take all this information and create sales 

232
00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:01,970
and marketing copy for a website so that this application, when it does get built, 

233
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:06,170
can actually be marketed. I'm AppyDave. Please like and subscribe. I'll see you in 

234
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:07,160
the next video.
