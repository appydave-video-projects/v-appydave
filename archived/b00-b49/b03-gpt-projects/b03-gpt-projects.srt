1
00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:05,530
OpenAI just made projects available in ChatGPT. Plus, in this video, we're going 

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:08,350
to check it out and see how useful it really is.

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:14,500
Now projects is a capability that I've been looking for from ChatGPT plus for a while, 

4
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:20,650
because if you look at my chats over here on the left, you can see this A68 A67. 

5
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:26,170
Now they represent for me video codes for videos that I've put out on AppyDave. And 

6
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:29,800
then we've got other sorts of conversations that I've been having. We go through 

7
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:35,230
September and we've got dozens and dozens of different chats. And the problem I always 

8
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:39,730
have is trying to come up with a naming convention so that I can find them again. 

9
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:45,590
So one of the things I sometimes do with my chats is I give them a prefix. So I kind 

10
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:49,580
of understand and remember where they came from. So if we look at two of the chats 

11
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:54,440
that are going on here, fly. This is for a video asset management software that I'm 

12
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:59,420
building for myself called FliVideo. So that's one of the first projects we want 

13
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:02,780
to identify, find the chats and put them into that project.

14
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:08,180
Moving further on, I can see that I've got HCL, which stands for KlueLess. The clue 

15
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:14,450
is to do less. This is a programming language that I'm developing using GPT. Further 

16
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:18,740
on, we've got anything that starts with an 'A' and a number. These are videos that 

17
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:26,150
I created in a particular month for AppyDave. Anything that starts with AWB is my 

18
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:30,230
Agent Workflow Builder software that I'm developing. And then a bit further on, we've 

19
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:36,920
got Kozi, which is a cafe idea in Thailand that I'm developing as a podcast.

20
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:41,260
So we come to the very top. You can see new projects, and what we'll do is we'll 

21
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:46,120
just create a couple projects to get started. So the first one we'll do is FliVideo 

22
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:50,890
for the video asset management tool that I've created. And then the next one, if 

23
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:56,350
we go and click on this add button, we'll just type in AppyDave and we'll put that. 

24
00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:00,730
We might just say videos actually, because this is where I'm going to put the videos. 

25
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:04,210
And while we're thinking of that we'll add in one more, which would be the AppyDave 

26
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,970
tools. Now what I'll do here is I might put a dash between it so that I can see it 

27
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:15,280
visually. Now, one of the things that happens if you do this is you might go, I want 

28
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:20,260
to rename this. So if you come and click on here, you won't have the ability to rename 

29
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:25,330
it. So if you go and click on it directly it'll come up here and you can rename it 

30
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:30,520
here. So I'm going to just put in a dash right there and we'll press save. And now 

31
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:34,450
we've got three projects ready to go within ChatGPT.

32
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:38,860
Now, if we look through the left here, I've got four different chats that I know 

33
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:44,350
are obvious that I need to put into videos, and that's because I code my videos in 

34
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:48,610
a sequential order, and I put a bit of a label after it. So what I'm going to do 

35
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:53,200
is just go through and click on all of them, and you see them start getting added. 

36
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,780
Now, if I do a refresh, they actually disappear from this list and they should be 

37
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,650
available here. 

38
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:04,280
Now I'm going to take a quick opportunity to rename these as I go, because while 

39
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:09,870
codes I can find my videos would be easier if I could see visually what this video 

40
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:15,150
is about. So recently I was using a pair programming tool called Aider, which allowed 

41
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:20,280
me to automate documentations and presentations. So now this is all listed under 

42
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,620
my AppyDave videos.

43
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:27,100
Now what I'll do next is I'll click on FliVideo. And this application that I'm building 

44
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:32,530
has a logo which is green. So what I might do is just change the folder color as 

45
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:36,610
we're going. And at the moment we can drag them up here like we've seen. But as I 

46
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:40,750
go further down we won't be able to see this project. So the other thing that you 

47
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:46,570
can do is click on the little options here and we can move it to FliVideo. And I 

48
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:51,490
know that the damn code, which stands for Digital Asset Management, is also part 

49
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:55,870
of FliVideo. So as I click through to them, they're just adding here on the right.

50
00:03:55,890 --> 00:04:01,530
Now. One capability I'm really looking forward to is this new one called Add Instructions. 

51
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:05,790
But we should just revisit custom instructions so that you understand what they're 

52
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:11,460
used for. So I have some custom instructions. They're quite simple. Basically, I 

53
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:18,240
want to limit how big the response is from ChatGPT by saying say ye if you understand, 

54
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:22,950
and then it just replies with yay! Or if I just want it to read the information and 

55
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:27,690
absorb it, I say read. And if I want it to create an image, I just say create image 

56
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:32,310
followed by the prompt and it creates the image. And so these are simple general 

57
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:35,820
purpose instructions that I use for all my chats. 

58
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:39,870
But what if you need project level instructions? Well, that's what we can do when 

59
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:42,360
we look at the add instructions.

60
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:46,770
So let's have a look at the custom instructions for affidavit videos. And before 

61
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:51,570
we do, we'll change the color to Brown, which is my brand color. And from there we'll 

62
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:56,220
just go and quickly look at the affidavit channel. Now here, I've got this more and 

63
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:00,930
I've got all this information about who I am. So this is branding information, but 

64
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:06,720
the way I usually put this into my videos, into my YouTube descriptions is I use 

65
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,730
the agent workflow builder and we will create a project for that in a second. And 

66
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:16,980
one of the things I do is I automate all of my launch of a video using chat GPT. 

67
00:05:17,00 --> 00:05:21,440
and one of those areas is down where I write the description and there's probably 

68
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,30
information for the brand. And generally I'm just pasting a whole lot of branding 

69
00:05:26,30 --> 00:05:31,310
information here, but it'd be nicer if this was automatically going into my chats. 

70
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,230
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna head over to add instructions, and I'm gonna say, 

71
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,280
this is information about my brand. 

72
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:45,660
And I'll just paste in what I currently would paste into my custom gpt.

73
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:50,320
Now I have all this information that I would put into marketing and YouTube descriptions, 

74
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,300
but it's a little bit too verbose for an instruction. So what I might just say is 

75
00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:00,760
about me, and then I'll just paste this information in. We've got my name is David 

76
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:06,280
AppyDave, a list of my channels, opt in and stuff like that, and a list of my skills.

77
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:10,940
So I spent about 20 minutes just doing a little bit of grouping, and let's just go 

78
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:15,440
through some of them to see the things that I'm thinking through as I start grouping 

79
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,510
projects. So the first one is five, five, five, seven websites. So essentially this 

80
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:27,320
is a manifesto that I built with ChatGPT about 18 months ago around the idea of building 

81
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:33,290
550 videos over 55 weeks on five channels. It's not something I've done, but it is 

82
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:38,300
a goal. And there are actually seven brands that I've been building all around this 

83
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:43,610
concept. So I want to keep this global overview of what I do all in one location.

84
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:48,400
So next we can look at the two major applications that I'm building. One is FliVideo, 

85
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:53,740
which is about achieving that goal is around the automation of myself and tools like 

86
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:58,330
that. And then Agent Workflow Builder, which is another way that I automate everything 

87
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:03,730
by having GPT workflows that solve different challenges, especially in the YouTube 

88
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:05,440
automation, but anywhere in business.

89
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:12,420
Next time documenting in a podcast some due diligence around setting up a cafe in 

90
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,150
Thailand. And that's called Kozi Kafe

91
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:20,720
Then I thought I'd do an image creation project because I have lots of images that 

92
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:26,180
I tend to do on a video by video basis, but then I can never find the images that 

93
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:32,300
I specifically want. So in this particular case, I was helping a friend get a logo 

94
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:36,500
together and we were just playing around with ChatGPT and Dall-E three to generate 

95
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:42,710
the images. So I'll probably end up having one project purely for the image ideation.

96
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:46,360
Now there's only a limited view of the projects here, but you can click on the see 

97
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:52,300
more. So if we go to a company that I work with where all the software architecture 

98
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:57,610
guidelines and best practices are being dealt with. If we go down to AppyDave videos, 

99
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:03,130
this is where I'll keep all the scripts and my analysis of the scripts. And I do 

100
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:07,450
all of this with Agent Workflow Builder. And the videos you can see are all listed 

101
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:12,120
I then have a open source project that I'm putting together called KlueLess, and 

102
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:17,670
this is where a custom tag seemed to make sense. So firstly the tag lines. The clue 

103
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,120
is to do 

104
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:22,570
Or even you can code even if you're clueless. This is a programming language that 

105
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:26,170
I'm putting together for interacting with large language models.

106
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:30,840
Now, I mentioned FliVideo as a YouTube automation tool. Well, where that's being 

107
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:37,320
used is AI-TLDR, and AI-TLDR is a channel that I put together. It's got about 80 

108
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:43,500
videos over the last six months. It's growing quite well, and what I'm really going 

109
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:48,300
to need is to keep track of a lot of the files. And you can currently see that there's 

110
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:52,890
a bunch of videos over here, and they are mapping to the files that are over on this 

111
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:57,240
system. So recently when we did the Sora video, which is just here, we've got the 

112
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,110
basic metadata and the script and all that being put together.

113
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:05,540
And so what I can do with this is come over and click on the Add files. And I think 

114
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:11,240
the two that we want is the Readme file and the affiliate file. This is where a list 

115
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:17,420
of information is. And I should just be able to drag them in and they've been added. 

116
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,790
Where this will end up being really useful for me is that there was a video done 

117
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:27,160
recently called Compose Quickly, and one of the things going on in it is an affiliate 

118
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:33,700
code. Now, this is just an incredible SEO friendly blogging tool, but if I want that 

119
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:39,130
information, I can go over to my conversation in ChatGPT and there's an affiliate 

120
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:43,270
file and that'll be listed there. So it'll be really easy to pull that information 

121
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:45,310
into chats that I'm doing in the future.

122
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:51,800
Anyway, I'm AppyDave. That was a quick look at the ChatGPT projects and how I plan 

123
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:56,810
to use them. I usually do videos on prompt engineering coding with AI and Agentic 

124
00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:01,100
frameworks. So if this is something that you're interested, please like and subscribe. 

125
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,750
I'll see you in the next video.
