1
00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:05,500
I just noticed that OpenAI Sora got released. So why don't we sign in and figure 

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:10,630
out how to use it? So I'm going to come down to this link for Sora right now, and 

3
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:16,360
we'll just click on the start now. And from there account creation is unavailable. 

4
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,560
So what do we do. Looks like we're going to have to wait a little while.

5
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,800
I tried signing on with my normal OpenAI account and it's also failed, so let's just 

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,800
give this a couple of hours, see what happens.

7
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:33,460
Out seems only needed to wait a few minutes, and so we can now put in a valid date 

8
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,260
here, which you're going to need to get started.

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:39,880
So it brings us to a usage page and we can have a look firstly at the GPT Pro. And 

10
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:44,200
you can see that you can get 10,000 credits, 500 videos at 480p, 

11
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:47,720
one by one aspect ratio of five seconds. 

12
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:53,180
relaxed mode allows you to cue multiple videos as you generate them. Now since I'm 

13
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:59,750
using plus, I'm going to have access to 1000 credits, about 50 videos at 480p So 

14
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,160
let's just press continue.

15
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:06,170
It's asked for a username. So I'm just going to put in AppyDave And you've got access 

16
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:10,730
to a little helper video and explore your feed. Now what we'll do is we'll close 

17
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:11,450
out of that.

18
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:16,950
So before I get started, I thought I'd come into ChatGPT and just ask the question 

19
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:22,560
about whether there are any tips that I need to follow when writing a prompt for 

20
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:28,260
Sora, which is OpenAI's video editor, and I've been explicit about that so that it 

21
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:31,770
knows to pick the right product. So we've got a whole lot of information here.

22
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:38,690
So I thought I'd try out doing videos on a cafe in Thailand called Kozi Kafe, and 

23
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:43,760
I've put in this prompt walk up to a cafe called Cozy Cafe. We'll upload this image 

24
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:50,720
and just mention that it's a cafe that caters to tourists and shows local artisan 

25
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,740
products, stuff like that. But we won't just write that prompt directly. What we'll 

26
00:01:54,740 --> 00:02:01,790
do is we'll come back into ChatGPT over here and say, can you use this and create

27
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,930
a five second

28
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:08,750
video concept? And we'll just paste in the rest of the information, and hopefully 

29
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:13,220
it's going to infer from the information above to give us a prompt.

30
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:17,890
Now, the prompt I thought I'd do with an image is called walk up to a cafe called 

31
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:23,230
Cozy Cafe in Chiang Mai, Thailand. It's a cafe that caters for tourists and local 

32
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:28,390
artisans, and we've got this image here that I'd like to use. But before we do, what 

33
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:34,420
we'll do is just run it as a prompt to see if it can come up with something cleaner, 

34
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:39,160
based on the guidelines above. So I've also said, can you use this to create a five 

35
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:44,590
second video concept? And it started writing something for us. So what we'll do is 

36
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:47,830
we'll just open all of this and we'll come back to here.

37
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:51,570
So we'll come down to the prompt and we'll just paste it all the way in. And let's 

38
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:56,190
have a look at a couple of the options here. So we can generate five and ten second 

39
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:01,440
videos. Maybe if you've got a pro plan you can do more I don't know. And we can do 

40
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,840
720p. Now if I do this I'm going to use up more of my credit. So I'm just going to 

41
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,220
stick with this one for now. And we can also play around with the aspect ratio. So 

42
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,750
let's also upload an image.

43
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,790
And when you do that it will first come up with a media upload agreement. So I'm 

44
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,800
going to tick them all off. I've read through 

45
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:24,820
Now I've got this message that you can't upload photos that have people. Now the 

46
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,670
photo we've got doesn't have a person, so that should be good.

47
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:32,140
So we come down to this button here, it says, create video, and we click on it and 

48
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:35,350
let's see what starts happening. So at the moment, it's generating 

49
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,130
video image, prompt opening frame, and we've, it's talking about what it's doing 

50
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:44,960
480p five seconds and it's 8 55 

51
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:49,440
modern bakery experience opening frame. The video starts with a scene of a street 

52
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,380
view in Chiang Mai lined with lush greenery 

53
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:56,550
And it would've gotten that local bakery experience from the fact that it says all 

54
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:57,660
about bread here. 

55
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:01,430
'cause as you can see, we didn't have the word bread here in the prompt. 

56
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:05,790
Now there's no timer telling us how long this is going to take. So far, it's been 

57
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:06,630
over a minute, 

58
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:10,340
so I'm about five minutes in at the moment. I just thought I'd do a search on perplexity 

59
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:15,650
to see what's happening. And many users have reported slow generation time, so often 

60
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:21,140
seeing a loading circle without successful video output. So this could be the experience 

61
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:24,830
I'll have here. I will try again if this happens after 10 minutes. 

62
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:29,930
Now there's also a couple of other pieces of information good to know. So it's going 

63
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:35,30
to struggle with realistic physics and consistency in log longer videos. So something 

64
00:04:35,30 --> 00:04:40,160
to be aware of. You might need to clear your browser case, check the status page, 

65
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,500
or try a different browser or device.

66
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:46,300
So seven minutes in. We're still uploading, as you can see here. But what I thought 

67
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:51,760
I'd do is just have a look at the uploads capability. So I took a bunch of images 

68
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:56,590
from this Kozi Kafe. We've got this outdoor scene. That is what the first video is 

69
00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:02,260
about. We've got a variation of the outdoor scene, some indoor scenes, some product 

70
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:09,160
displays, soaps and a grassy knoll to the side of the cafe. And also potential sort 

71
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,570
of infographics around pricing. One of the things I noticed when you upload images 

72
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,280
is if you upload two by accident, which I did, you can't delete them. So they're 

73
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:22,690
all listed here at the moment. And I've got no real way of changing this, so keep 

74
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:23,380
that in mind.

75
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:27,120
So working on the assumption that this might have hung. I'm just going to try clicking 

76
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,860
on this storyboard. And what we'll do is we'll paste in the same prompt as before. 

77
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:37,680
And when I went to pick the actual image, it only allowed it from the file system, 

78
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,960
not from those uploaded files. So that's something else to be aware of. I don't know 

79
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,400
whether I can even move this around, so the aspect ratio that it's showing here has 

80
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:52,320
been determined by OpenAI. But what we'll do is we'll click on the storyboard and 

81
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:58,470
we're taken to this area where we can now see things as different scenes. So these 

82
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:03,840
look like the scenes that we saw in the original one being generated. And let's just 

83
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,910
click create and see what happens here. And it's saying we can only do one generation 

84
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:13,830
at a time. So I'm on a plus account. I think that's different if you're on a pro 

85
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:14,310
account.

86
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:17,420
But while we're looking at this storyboard, here's another interesting thing. So 

87
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:23,930
you can regenerate the scene text. Now, I didn't find a way to be able to edit it 

88
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,300
manually, but we should just be able to click these 

89
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,320
here's scene three coming through as a new scene.

90
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:34,260
What now has happened is that this is starting to change and we're at 91%. So I think 

91
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,880
we're going to finish okay.

92
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:42,520
So the lesson there is to be patient. For me, that took about 15 minutes, I think.

93
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:47,350
And here we have two images and it looks like the right one. Let's see what happens 

94
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:52,630
if we hit play. Oh look at that. It's put real people into this shot. Now there's 

95
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:58,630
our physics issue going on. We're seeing the glass reflection not working. And it 

96
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:00,820
just looks like people are walking through a wall here.

97
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:05,130
So let's not upload an image for the next video. Let's just describe a scene. So 

98
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:09,780
what I'm going to do is paste in an image of some soaps that are for sale at this 

99
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,310
particular Kozi Kafe 

100
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:15,380
So what I'll do is I'll paste it in here. And this time I will use the storyboard 

101
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:20,720
just to see what's going on with this. And we've got these four scenes. So the camera 

102
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:24,980
sunny morning in Chiang Mai. The light filters through lush greenery. Then we've 

103
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:30,830
got inside the shop. A person walks past wooden shelves lined with vibrant, carved, 

104
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:31,340
fragrant soap.

105
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,200
Now I'm going to press create here. It's been added to the queue. It says the person 

106
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:41,930
reaches the carved soap section and gently picks up a soap shaped like a blooming 

107
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:46,580
lotus flower. And then we've got the camera zooms in on the soap, capturing the delicate 

108
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,680
carvings and soft pastel colors.

109
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:53,190
So you'll know it's running, because you'll see this little activity counter over 

110
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:57,510
here. But we should be able to click here and come back to see the generation over 

111
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,620
here as well.

112
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:03,480
I'm a bit slow on the timer, but we'll just start one. We've been going for about 

113
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,630
one minute at the moment, maybe two minutes.

114
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:11,580
Now it seems stuck here on 99%, but it's also told me that it's ready to watch. So 

115
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:17,940
what I might do is just do a refresh on the screen and see what happens next. And 

116
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:23,460
so what I had to do here was actually click on this to bring up this new view. So 

117
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:30,120
can we hit play on this. And not yet. We are currently about 14 or 15 minutes into 

118
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,560
this generation.

119
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,530
So here we have the video. In fact, we've got two videos and I might need to go back 

120
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:38,500
and check the other one, because there must have been a second one on the left that 

121
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:44,110
I didn't notice. But if we hit play on this, we'll see these. Looking at the soaps, 

122
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:49,120
it's coming up to the stand where the soaps are available, and then we zoom in on 

123
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:49,630
them.

124
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:54,460
So I've just come back and I have noticed that this is another video. So if we just 

125
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:58,900
hit play on this, there's just not a lot going on other than the tree is moving with 

126
00:08:58,900 --> 00:08:59,530
this one.

127
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:05,380
So let's do one more use case. What I've done is this daily generated infographic, 

128
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:09,820
and I've just asked it to describe the infographic. Then from there, I've put in 

129
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:14,830
this question, can you do a video description about an ebook that teaches people 

130
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:20,620
how to set up and run a cafe in Thailand listing the cost, pricing, models, and sales 

131
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:25,240
and marketing materials? So that's starting to generate a prompt that we should be 

132
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,500
able to put in with this one. I think we'll do this as a storyboard as well.

133
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:34,950
So it's just writing that out. And what we'll do is we'll copy it straight into the 

134
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:41,220
describe your video. And I'm going to go with the storyboard concept one more time 

135
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:45,480
just to see how that looks. Let's click on storyboard. I'm not going to be changing 

136
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,390
any of these items just yet.

137
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:52,530
and you can see them all listed here. So what we'll do is we'll press create, and 

138
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:55,590
we'll just kick off a timer to see how long this is going to take.

139
00:09:55,590 --> 00:10:00,950
And there it is, complete. We've taken about ten minutes. So let's just go over and 

140
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:06,230
test this out. Discover. And we can't read the text, which is pretty normal with 

141
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:12,560
generations. It's got a few errors in it, but this is actually looking interesting 

142
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,950
as an idea for an e-book. Let's just go and have a look at the other one we've got 

143
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:23,210
here. Learn in the successful who and strategies who have trusted in Thailand. A 

144
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:25,160
bit of a challenge there as well, 

145
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:29,590
maybe this zoom in effect is pretty good with this particular video. What was the 

146
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:34,810
effect here? This was more moving in different directions. And this like expanding 

147
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:35,830
circle is pretty cool.

148
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:41,190
Now just to finalize off, if you go up into settings, there's an area called My Plan. 

149
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:46,530
And from here you can see that I've used up 150 of the thousand credits I've got, 

150
