In this video we're doing a tutorial on prompt engineering
in visual storytelling. Part of it will set up a storyline, we'll break down how
the prompts work, we'll develop a shot list
and maybe some images. After that we'll look at reframing it for other types of
storylines, think multiverse. Now all of this is part of a talk I
gave recently at Ecamm Live's Leap Event on multi-agent
storytelling, so if you want to find out more about that the link is in the
description. Otherwise let's get into the tutorial.
So let's start off with a tutorial on effective prompt engineering and to do
that we're going to do it from a storytelling
perspective by talking about a woman and her cat
in New York as a storytelling construct. And when I'm doing prompt engineering
it's all about breaking it down into the component parts such as in this case
a structured sequence of events. We've also got the protagonist which
happens to be the woman, the environment or the scene which
happens to be New York and the fact that she has
another character being her cat. With that information in place we give the
structure of what we want to create which is a five
scene write-up and we would like something dramatic maybe in the third
scene and from there we end up getting storytelling.
That's over five different scenes. Now the next thing that we want to do from
here is get some sort of visualization but
before we do the visualization we need to create what's called
a shot list. Now the shot list is just a simple continuation
of the story we just created just with a little bit of output formatting.
In this case create a simplified shot list and we see that information coming
through and there's a lot of visual componentry
going into what's being written. Now that we've got the story
and the shot list we can go into generating prompts that allow us
to generate these images in something like Leonardo
AI. Now to create images effectively the things that are important is that
firstly we continue the context of the previous part of the conversation
with an output format which is generate a concise
image prompt. After that we give the aesthetic style that we want it's pretty
simple here it's just New York City a woman 2025 and then lastly because
there are multiple characters we want to make sure that each of the
characters are stylistically the same in every scene.
Last thing we need is to see a cat that's brown in one scene and black in
the next scene. So we continue the conversation
and one of the things that you notice is that all the image prompts that have
been generated all have the same fluffy orange tabby
cat in each of the scenes so hopefully we're going to get
visual consistency. So when we start running this through Leonardo AI you end
up with a bunch of images that look pretty good.
We can notice in the third scene that there is a dramatic
issue going on here the cat is escaping in the park.
So we have our final story of the woman in her 30s in New York with her cat
but what if we want to take this same story and restructure it for a different
period in time and for this let's go with Elizabethan
Times or Shakespeare Hamlet sort of style. From that we can just take a new
prompt a reframe prompt we ensure that the woman and the cat are
in each scene but the scene should be quite different
because it's a different period in time and we do have a reinforcement part of
the prompt that says that only image prompts are
expected the woman and the cat should have visual consistency across
every scene. And so now we have our noble woman and her
cat in London it's a similar sort of concept but one of the things that you
notice when you see them side by side is that there is a little bit of a
flaw. The blonde woman in the first scene is
a little bit different colored blonde and then she becomes silver and then a
darker brunette followed by silver at the end and what we're looking at
is what I call instructional collapse in prompt engineering.
So that was the end of the tutorial section that I did
on prompt engineering for storytelling. This was part of the ECAM
live leap event that I did recently where I was talking about multi-agent
architecture in a project called emotional support spiders.
Now if you would like to work with me one-on-one then check out the link in
the description you can book a call. Otherwise if you want to learn more
about the other agent workflows and human in the loop
concepts that I talked about at that seminar then check out the next video.
I'm Epi Dave, have a great day.
