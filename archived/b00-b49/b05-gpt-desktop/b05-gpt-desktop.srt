1
00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:06,150
In this video, we're testing out the new ChatGPT desktop and its ability to integrate 

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:07,220
with applications.

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:12,140
So the integrations I want to test out is the notion app that we're looking at here. 

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:17,90
We might be able to do an integration with Chrome and a web application. How about 

5
00:00:17,90 --> 00:00:22,730
we try with Visual Studio and maybe the terminal. And let's see if we can also work 

6
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:27,590
with something like an image from either preview or directly with the file.

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,30
So at the moment I've got notion open and what we'll do is we'll drag in the GPT 

8
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:38,780
desktop application. And what we'll firstly do is just use the search capability 

9
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:44,00
by clicking this button right here. And with the search turned on, we'll just ask 

10
00:00:44,00 --> 00:00:50,570
the question of what are these new capabilities going on from day 11 of OpenAI's 

11
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:55,250
12 Days of Christmas? And we've got all this information coming through. And what 

12
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:59,00
I'd like to do first is get this into the notion application.

13
00:00:59,30 --> 00:01:03,870
So we can see here that we've got an advanced voice mode. So we'll check that out 

14
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:08,760
at some stage. And we've got integration into writing tools of which notion is one 

15
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,650
of them. And Apple notes. So what we should do is turn off the search and click on 

16
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,560
this integration button and see what it comes up with.

17
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:21,330
So when this dialog comes up, there are two sections. This is the section of applications 

18
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:26,160
that are open at the moment. But there'll also be an inactive apps. And these are 

19
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,940
applications that are available but that I haven't used. But what we'll do at the 

20
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:34,50
moment is we'll go to notion, which is the application behind us, and we'll click 

21
00:01:34,50 --> 00:01:39,390
enable. So we need to enable the accessibility permissions. We'll just click on this 

22
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:44,880
button here and we'll come to this accessibility. And we'll turn on ChatGPT.

23
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:50,930
So that's now integrated. And when we come down and click on this button again it'll 

24
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:52,430
say that it's paired.

25
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:57,800
Now as we test things out. Some things might not work the way I'm expecting. I've 

26
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:02,120
watched the video from day 11, and one of my first questions and what we'll test 

27
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:07,730
out here is is it a full duplex system? Meaning can it read from notion and write 

28
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:11,870
to notion at the same time? Now, one of the things you can notice with the chat window 

29
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:16,430
is it's actually talking about what it's connected to at the moment. So we're currently 

30
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:22,640
connected to the notion application. So let's test the idea of can we take the content 

31
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,110
that we've just grabbed 

32
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:26,930
And write it directly into the notion page?

33
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:31,110
So I've just added this simple prompt. Can you add all the information into the notion 

34
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:35,160
page? And we'll just execute that and see if anything happens. 

35
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,590
What it's done is given us an instructions of what to do. It hasn't actually written 

36
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:44,00
the information as you can see, but it's said open the notion page and it's actually 

37
00:02:44,00 --> 00:02:45,790
got the name of the notion page, 

38
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:50,130
correct here, which is great. Click it anywhere on the page to go into edit mode 

39
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,870
and then structure the content. So we've got this information now it's just talking 

40
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,430
about a copy paste, 

41
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:02,130
instructions. So let's go and select all the information that's available for us 

42
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:02,520
here 

43
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:07,530
and we'll press copy and we'll come on down here and press enter and paste it all 

44
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:07,860
in. 

45
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:13,340
So the first test of making modifications in chat, GPT and then asking it to send 

46
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:18,620
it to Notion hasn't proven to do too much. We've had to just manually copy and paste, 

47
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:23,520
but maybe we can read this document in a different chat window and do something with 

48
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,150
it that way.

49
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,990
So what I'll do is I'll create a brand new chat, and what we can do is we can go 

50
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:32,720
and click on this button here. We've got a new chat window created. And interestingly 

51
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:38,180
we are still connected to the notion template here. So let's just type in a prompt 

52
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:42,750
and we'll go can you give me a bullet point list from the information in ChatGPT 

53
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:47,930
desktop so that I can create some infographics. And then from that I think

54
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:52,180
go give me three different sorts of lists, because I want to see what sort of information 

55
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:56,880
I can extract out of this and create some sort of visual representation.

56
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:01,480
Okay, so that's just finished and it's pretty good. We've got three different lists 

57
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:06,850
come out and it's all interpretations of the information on the left. So we've got 

58
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:11,710
the advanced voice mode writing tools integration and the desktop applications. Now 

59
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:17,80
one of the capabilities that I tested yesterday is the video sharing using voice 

60
00:04:17,80 --> 00:04:23,800
mode. And I've got a video coming out which shows you how to use ChatGPT as a universal 

61
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:29,110
translator or a universal assistant. It's really powerful. But what I think we'll 

62
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:34,270
do is we'll just go and capture this information manually and then open up another 

63
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,910
application and see if we can integrate into that.

64
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:41,810
What I've done over on the left is I've opened up Chrome, and I've just gone to a 

65
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:46,630
simple web application that I know about called napkin. And this is a wonderful tool. 

66
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:52,310
And for now, I'm just going to paste in some of the information that we just got. 

67
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:56,750
now, what I'd like to do is use this information and create an infographic. So what 

68
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:00,740
we'll do is we'll just go and click on this little button here, and it's just going 

69
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:05,690
to absorb this information and come up with various graphics that we could work with. 

70
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,990
So we'll just go through and have a look for something that we like. I 

71
00:05:09,00 --> 00:05:14,380
we'll click on it one more time. And now we have access to a graphic and we should 

72
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:20,530
be able to export it as PNG or SVG. But it might be useful if we can absorb this 

73
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,310
into ChatGPT desktop. So that'll be our next test.

74
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:28,890
So I might test by creating a new chat window again. So we'll come and click here 

75
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:31,950
and we'll stop the working with notion. 

76
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:36,10
So when you do the stop integration it stops for all of them. So we'll just come 

77
00:05:36,10 --> 00:05:40,600
and click on this button and see what we've got available now. So when we look through 

78
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:46,120
this list we've got applications that are not Chrome. And if we go to inactive applications 

79
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,590
we don't have Chrome here. 

80
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:52,370
So from what I can tell integrating with a web application isn't going to work.

81
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:57,200
So I think we should just load these graphics straight into our notion page at the 

82
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:02,330
moment, and we'll do that for each of them. So I've just grabbed number two infographic 

83
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:07,220
and number three infographic and I'm just pasting them into napkin. And we can find 

84
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:12,710
some graphics that we like this way and just repeat that for the third one. So we've 

85
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:17,900
quickly built three different infographics just by copying and pasting some information 

86
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:22,490
that we generated in list form using the ChatGPT client here.

87
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:28,230
So now our notion template is updated. We've got three infographics in it so far. 

88
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:32,880
From a testing point of view though, we've been able to read information quite easily 

89
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,170
out of notion. But writing back to it has still been a manual sort of process. 

90
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:41,500
So what I'm thinking of doing is let's create a little web presentation, 

91
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:45,870
We've got a bunch of information that we'd like in the presentation, and we've got 

92
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:50,730
a couple of infographics that will make it visually appealing. So I think we should 

93
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:56,190
just create a new chat window. We are going to need to reconnect through to notion. 

94
00:06:56,190 --> 00:07:00,630
So we'll go and click plus on that. We're now working with notion. And I think we 

95
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:04,140
can go into advanced voice mode and see what happens here.

96
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,530
I would like you to create A-H-T-M-L presentation for me. The way I want you to go 

97
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:15,440
about it is look at the information from the notion page and come up with the structure 

98
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:21,350
of a presentation. It should have three slides in it. After that, can you also write 

99
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:28,400
it using Tailwind CSS? We'll put it into a simple HTML page, and I'll supply the 

100
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:34,340
three graphics that we can currently see on the Notion template as individual .png 

101
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:39,500
files in the same folder as the actual HTML page that we're going 

102
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:40,340
to create an HTML 

103
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:45,570
notion content you provided. You can start with three slides. One new capabilities 

104
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:46,260
from day 11, 

105
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,390
overview of the latest features, introduced 

106
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:52,740
two key features and updates, details about advanced voice mode and integration with 

107
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:53,430
writing tools. 

108
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:56,530
Three, product update highlights, summary of benefits 

109
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,610
for the structure, use a simple HTML page with tailwind CSS classes for styling. 

110
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:05,140
Include the three PNG graphics and the appropriate slides. This will ensure a clean 

111
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,400
and effective presentation.

112
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:11,650
Now the advanced voice mode worked to create some information, but one of the things 

113
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:16,780
I didn't see here was the ability to integrate with canvas, which is something I 

114
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:21,100
would use if I was doing the coding. So I've come over to the regular web view, and 

115
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,980
we're just going to paste this information that we got, 

116
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:29,140
So the original information from ChatGPT desktop is here and we've just got can you 

117
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:34,510
create a slideshow. I've said that I'll give it three images and I just want a little 

118
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:38,920
frame. And lastly I'm just going to make sure it's using canvas. And what this will 

119
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,860
do is just build a little application for us. 

120
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:47,370
We'll go back to ChatGPT desktop and we'll integrate with this code, maybe using 

121
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:48,330
VS code.

122
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,850
So I've just taken all this information, copied it. I've put it into a file called 

123
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:58,00
slides. And if we run it, it looks like it's working okay. It's not very pretty, 

124
00:08:58,00 --> 00:09:02,560
but it is working. And I think it's that integration with VSCode that we could do 

125
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,90
that can make this look more stylish.

126
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:09,310
So we'll stay within this chat. But what we're going to do is stop our connection 

127
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:14,230
to notion and go and add a new connection. And this time we're going to do it to 

128
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:19,00
code. And it looks like we've got to add an extension to Visual Studio to make this 

129
00:09:19,00 --> 00:09:19,960
work correctly.

130
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:24,910
So I was expecting to be able to use it from the extension marketplace, but it doesn't 

131
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:27,250
seem like it's available yet. It's 

132
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:32,550
saying that it can work with VSCode, but also other tools like cursor and that we 

133
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:37,470
need to download it. So I've just pressed Command shift P and we'll just go with 

134
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:45,120
extensions install from VSIX. And we just scroll down and click on this and click 

135
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:45,750
install.

136
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:50,350
Now I've come back to ChatGPT desktop. We can click on this little button and now 

137
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:54,280
we can add code. And it says working with code.

138
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:59,170
Now, initially, I didn't have a whole lot of control over what it was pointing at 

139
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:04,930
on my particular system. I had eight versions of Visual Studio running across multiple 

140
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:09,610
desktops, so I pretty much had to close them all down. And then when I clicked on 

141
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:14,640
a file, that's when this became the focus. So if we just come over and click on a 

142
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,840
logo, because I think for the presentation, we should style it after something and 

143
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:23,760
we'll come back to here and we'll see if we've got that available.

144
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,640
So we'll write a little prompt that says, can you extract the image colors from this 

145
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:33,490
image and list them with nice names? Now what image? I'm just going to see what happens 

146
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:38,350
if I paste in the file name. And we'll just press enter. So we've got some sort of 

147
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,510
analyzing going on at the moment. 

148
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:44,960
So we'll try a different technique. If we come over here we've got upload a photo. 

149
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:49,190
We could do that. Let's try this. Take a screenshot. And it looks like we want to 

150
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:54,650
work with code. So we'll go with open system settings and make sure that we've got 

151
00:10:54,680 --> 00:11:00,320
accessibility available. And it's this enable screen recording that we need to turn 

152
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:06,860
on. So that's now available. And I've probably got to reopen the application. So 

153
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:12,80
let's take a screenshot. We'll go with code. And it looks like it's uploading something. 

154
00:11:12,80 --> 00:11:18,80
And we'll go can you extract the colors. And let's find some nice names. I'm hoping 

155
00:11:18,80 --> 00:11:21,710
for the light brown and the dark brown to come through, maybe even a little bit of 

156
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:22,670
the gray.

157
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:28,900
And this is a really awesome analysis actually, because you can see there's a background 

158
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:33,970
transparency going on. It's picked up some of that. So we've got the occurrences 

159
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:37,60
of these different colors being shown for us as well.

160
00:11:37,60 --> 00:11:41,540
But the problem with this analysis is that it's picked up all the dark greys and 

161
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:45,950
blacks from around the image, and not the main image. So what we'll do is we'll just 

162
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:51,470
upload the file and make it really simple, and we'll use the same prompt again and 

163
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:52,630
see what we get. 

164
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:56,260
So we've got a listing of colors. I've just selected them and copied them. 

165
00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:02,640
Can you update slides dot HTML with these colors. And what we'll do is we'll just 

166
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,290
paste in what we've got.

167
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:08,370
Now the code on the left is what it's generated, and it's quite a problem because 

168
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:13,230
it obviously didn't read this file because this file has three slides in it. It's 

169
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:18,720
got a little bit of JavaScript and we've got a frame. And we really want to see the 

170
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,980
colors that we've picked over here integrated into this somehow. 

171
00:12:23,00 --> 00:12:28,770
I'm going to come up and just use these colors that we had before. And I think I'll 

172
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:34,20
just go back to canvas in this particular case and use the prompt that we were hoping 

173
00:12:34,20 --> 00:12:39,420
would work in the ChatGPT desktop. Now, if this is working correctly, we're going 

174
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:44,880
to see colors come through for the different branding guidelines. And then they should 

175
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:51,480
get used somewhere. So text secondary background primary is coming through into the 

176
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:56,340
HTML. So canvas works great but this is still only working from the web view. 

177
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:02,350
We better come back and just replace this hit save. And now we have new capabilities 

178
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:05,950
in our slideshow. Still probably a problem in the background, 

179
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:11,130
But that's an easy fix. And it really has nothing to do with the testing of the ChatGPT 

180
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:11,670
desktop.

181
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:18,210
Now so far the features of the desktop version of chat GPT are a little incomplete. 

182
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:23,280
Some of them work a little bit, but most of them aren't working to the level of integration 

183
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:27,960
that I would love to see. But this is an initial BETA version, so we'll see what 

184
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:32,220
happens. What I think we can do is let's try one more prompt. Let's see if we can 

185
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:37,20
extract the information in the slide deck. And we'll write a little prompt that says, 

186
00:13:37,20 --> 00:13:42,30
can you read from this slide deck, get the data and we'll see if we can turn it into 

187
00:13:42,30 --> 00:13:43,620
some sort of JSON structure. 

188
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:47,430
Now it has found that information and from the looks of things, this has actually 

189
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:52,920
worked pretty good. So if we look at it, we've got title, new capabilities from day 

190
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:58,140
one that's coming from this information here. Let's look at the color that came back 

191
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:01,140
from it. So we've got 203, 186, 156 

192
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,870
that's coming from this background primary. And then we can see key features and 

193
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:10,670
updates, highlight voice mode functionality. And that's coming from here. So this 

194
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:17,690
information is definitely reading cleanly from VS code using the chat GPT desktop.

195
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:23,960
So that's my first look at ChatGPT desktop. It's got a little ways to go. A few things 

196
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:28,220
don't work the way you want, but it's got huge potential. So I'm looking forward 

197
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:33,500
to seeing what OpenAI do in the next couple of months. Now I do videos usually on 

198
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:38,540
prompt engineering, AI, architecture, and agents. So please like and subscribe if 

199
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:41,750
that's the sort of information you're after. See you in the next video.
