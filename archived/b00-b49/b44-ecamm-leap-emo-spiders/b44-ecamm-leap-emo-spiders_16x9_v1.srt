1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
I'm AppyDave, and in this video we're looking at a talk that I gave last night for 

2
00:00:05,633 --> 00:00:11,466
Ecamm Live Tech Summit on multi-agent workflows. And specifically, we're looking 

3
00:00:11,466 --> 00:00:16,066
at a framework that I've been putting together called Emotional Support Spiders.

4
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:20,733
In this video, we'll be covering the prompt engineering the AI workflows and agents, 

5
00:00:20,733 --> 00:00:26,033
and also talking about how I'm putting together a system for multiple character, 

6
00:00:26,033 --> 00:00:29,700
multiple storylines with videography to fit. 

7
00:00:29,766 --> 00:00:36,433
So if you're currently a YouTuber or a storyteller online and you're using AI at 

8
00:00:36,433 --> 00:00:42,333
the moment, you might be concerned about whether in the future AI is going to get 

9
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:47,333
rid of you from the picture, or is it something that's going to give you superpowers 

10
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:53,533
over time? So in this video, we're looking at different aspects of storytelling and 

11
00:00:53,533 --> 00:00:59,300
visualization with AI. For instance, in the next five years, it's predicted that 

12
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:06,933
90% of all content online will be AI generated one way or another. So here I'm talking 

13
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:13,533
about the AI workflows that I use, and what I'm suggesting might be good for creators. 

14
00:01:13,533 --> 00:01:16,533
And I do it through what I call the scale framework.

15
00:01:16,533 --> 00:01:22,533
So let's power up, get on our superpowers and have a look at what we can do Today 

16
00:01:22,533 --> 00:01:25,400
with video content generation and movies 

17
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,633
are forged in the fires of the YouTube battlefield. 

18
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:33,666
Only the strongest, the most persistent, the most clickbait driven warriors 

19
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:35,066
will survive 

20
00:01:35,066 --> 00:01:38,366
in the kingdom of contempt, views our power 

21
00:01:38,366 --> 00:01:44,466
and the shows. No Mercy AppyDave was once just a creator, but when the prophecy called 

22
00:01:44,466 --> 00:01:52,833
for 555 videos in 55 weeks across five channels, he answered, he has climbed the 

23
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:57,933
treacherous mountain of mastery where many have fallen. He has battled burnout, 

24
00:01:57,933 --> 00:02:03,200
braved the shadow band swamps, and faced the dreaded demonetization dungeon. 

25
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,300
He has studied the sacred texts, viral thumbnails, retention graphs in every cat 

26
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:16,000
video in search of the ultimate truth. Is he a genius, a madman, a man haunted by 

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,533
the ghosts of unfinished edits? No one knows, 

28
00:02:19,533 --> 00:02:23,733
but one thing certain he won't stop 

29
00:02:23,733 --> 00:02:31,200
until he finds the answer or loses his mind. Trying. This is the ridiculous legend 

30
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,100
of AppyDave and the 5 5 5 Manifesto. 

31
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:42,033
So that was AppyDave, the 5 5 5 Manifesto, which is a Hollywood style blockbuster 

32
00:02:42,066 --> 00:02:48,200
video trailer that I put together a couple of months ago for a different tech summit. 

33
00:02:48,533 --> 00:02:53,200
And what I wanna do is talk about how I'm putting these together across multiple 

34
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,100
channels.

35
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,133
So let's look at one of the fundamental ideas that are needed to succeed on YouTube. 

36
00:02:59,133 --> 00:03:04,600
And this comes from MrBeast. When asked the question why after I've done ten videos, 

37
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:09,633
am I not seeing any subscribers or views? And he says that unless you've done 100 

38
00:03:09,633 --> 00:03:14,433
videos and looked at how to improve on each and every video, don't bother wasting 

39
00:03:14,433 --> 00:03:20,933
his time. And what I did a couple of years ago was to think, can I do that 100 videos? 

40
00:03:20,933 --> 00:03:23,466
But can I do it across five different channels?

41
00:03:23,466 --> 00:03:29,100
So for some time now, I've been using this metaphor called the Mountain of Mastery, 

42
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:34,000
which is a spiral learning metaphor that says that as you go around the mountain, 

43
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:39,300
at each stage you can see something different. But as you go around the mountain 

44
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:43,766
a couple of times and you look at a higher level, you have more clarity around what 

45
00:03:43,766 --> 00:03:48,600
it is you're seeing. And I find this happens to be the case across concepts like 

46
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:54,366
YouTube titles, how to write descriptions, how to do hooks, how to do outros. As 

47
00:03:54,366 --> 00:03:59,066
I go through the mountain of mastery, over time I learn a little bit more. 

48
00:03:59,066 --> 00:04:04,566
and what I wanted to do with that knowledge is encapsulate it into AI agents for 

49
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:09,966
YouTube automation. And that's where the 5 5 5 Manifesto started a couple of years 

50
00:04:09,966 --> 00:04:17,700
ago in a conversation with ChatGPT, where I said, can I create 555 videos in 55 weeks 

51
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:22,933
across five different channels? And looking to do that using automation systems.

52
00:04:22,933 --> 00:04:29,000
Now to start achieving that, I had to put in place a new system of thinking and automation, 

53
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,800
and I call that the scale framework. And the idea of the scale framework is that 

54
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,733
we start from the point of view of structured prompt engineering. The ability to 

55
00:04:38,766 --> 00:04:43,866
communicate with AI is one of the fundamental skills that we need. The way we're 

56
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:45,933
using large language models today.

57
00:04:45,933 --> 00:04:50,800
Once you understand how to do the prompt engineering, you can move into prompt chains 

58
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:57,233
or crafting different workflows or standard operating procedures that automate certain 

59
00:04:57,233 --> 00:05:03,200
parts of your business or your YouTube content creation. After that, I like to package 

60
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:08,233
it all up in agents. Now, these agents might be pure automations, or they might be 

61
00:05:08,233 --> 00:05:11,033
automations with human in the loop concepts. 

62
00:05:11,033 --> 00:05:15,533
After that we want to hook into low code tools. So let's say you've done a video, 

63
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:20,766
you've generated an article based off the video. You then want to be able to push 

64
00:05:20,766 --> 00:05:25,900
that directly into your WordPress site. Or you might want to upload assets to Canva. 

65
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:30,500
And this is where low code automation can kick in. The last thing that we're ultimately 

66
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:35,500
trying to do is become more productive. So how do we empower content creators to 

67
00:05:35,533 --> 00:05:40,266
get a whole lot of stuff done, which is involved with this business, with the limited 

68
00:05:40,266 --> 00:05:43,366
resources of just some AI agents?

69
00:05:43,366 --> 00:05:49,066
So let's start off with a tutorial on effective prompt engineering. And to do that, 

70
00:05:49,066 --> 00:05:54,366
we're going to do it from a storytelling perspective by talking about a woman and 

71
00:05:54,366 --> 00:06:00,266
her cat in New York as a storytelling construct. And when I'm doing prompt engineering, 

72
00:06:00,266 --> 00:06:04,733
it's all about breaking it down into the component parts, such as, in this case, 

73
00:06:04,766 --> 00:06:09,366
a structured sequence of events. We've also got the protagonist, which happens to 

74
00:06:09,366 --> 00:06:13,766
be the woman, the environment, or the scene which happens to be New York, and the 

75
00:06:13,766 --> 00:06:16,833
fact that she has another character being her cat.

76
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:20,533
With that information in place, we give the structure of what we want to create, 

77
00:06:20,533 --> 00:06:25,566
which is a five scene write up, and we would like something dramatic maybe in the 

78
00:06:25,566 --> 00:06:30,966
third scene. And from there we end up getting storytelling that's over five different 

79
00:06:30,966 --> 00:06:36,200
scenes. Now, the next thing that we want to do from here is get some sort of visualization. 

80
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:40,733
But before we do the visualization, we need to create what's called a shot list.

81
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:45,900
Now the shot list is just a simple continuation of the story we just created, just 

82
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:50,433
with a little bit of output formatting. In this case, create a simplified shot list, 

83
00:06:50,433 --> 00:06:55,033
and we see that information coming through. And there's a lot of visual componentry 

84
00:06:55,066 --> 00:06:57,000
going into what's being written.

85
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:01,400
Now that we've got the story and the shot list, we can go into generating prompts 

86
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:06,233
that allow us to generate these images in something like Leonardo AI.

87
00:07:06,433 --> 00:07:11,233
Now to create images effectively. The things that are important is that firstly, 

88
00:07:11,233 --> 00:07:16,200
we continue the context of the previous part of the conversation with an output format, 

89
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:21,233
which is generate a concise image prompt. After that, we give the aesthetic style 

90
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:26,700
that we want. It's pretty simple here. It's just New York City, a woman 2025. And 

91
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:30,966
then lastly, because there are multiple characters, we want to make sure that each 

92
00:07:30,966 --> 00:07:36,933
of the characters are stylistically the same in every scene. Last thing we need is 

93
00:07:36,933 --> 00:07:41,233
to see a cat that's brown in one scene and black in the next scene.

94
00:07:41,233 --> 00:07:45,966
So we continue the conversation. And one of the things that you notice is that all 

95
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:50,933
the image prompts that have been generated all have the same fluffy orange tabby 

96
00:07:50,966 --> 00:07:56,366
cat in each of the scenes. So hopefully we're going to get visual consistency. So 

97
00:07:56,366 --> 00:08:00,733
when we start running this through Leonardo AI, you end up with a bunch of images 

98
00:08:00,733 --> 00:08:05,466
that look pretty good. We can notice in the third scene that there is a dramatic 

99
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,566
issue going on here. The cat is escaping in the park.

100
00:08:08,566 --> 00:08:14,166
So we have our final story of the woman in her 30s in New York with her cat. But 

101
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:19,200
what if we want to take this same story and restructure it for a different period 

102
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:25,266
in time? And for this, let's go with Elizabethan times or Shakespeare Hamlet sort 

103
00:08:25,266 --> 00:08:31,200
of style. From that, we can just take a new prompt, a reframe prompt. We ensure that 

104
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:35,200
the woman and the cat are in each scene, but the scene should be quite different 

105
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,066
because it's a different period in time. And we do have a reinforcement part of the 

106
00:08:40,066 --> 00:08:44,933
prompt that says that only image prompts are expected. The woman and the cat should 

107
00:08:44,933 --> 00:08:48,200
have visual consistency across every scene.

108
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:53,666
And so now we have our noble woman and her cat in London. It's a similar sort of 

109
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,833
concept, but one of the things that you notice when you see them side by side is 

110
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:02,866
that there is a little bit of a flaw. The blonde woman in the first scene is a little 

111
00:09:02,866 --> 00:09:07,433
bit different colored blonde, and then she becomes silver and then a darker brunette, 

112
00:09:07,466 --> 00:09:12,500
followed by silver at the end. And what we're looking at is what I call instructional 

113
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:17,266
collapse in prompt engineering. So in the next section let's see how we can improve 

114
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:19,233
that with AI workflows.

115
00:09:19,233 --> 00:09:23,566
So in the scale framework we've just looked at Structured Prompt engineering. Now 

116
00:09:23,566 --> 00:09:28,466
we're going to look at crafting workflows. And these are simple prompt chains that 

117
00:09:28,466 --> 00:09:34,033
you put in place to execute the same sort of instructions over and over again in 

118
00:09:34,033 --> 00:09:43,966
a systematic way. And I like to use them in three main areas business optimization, 
creative processes like you're seeing in this presentation or in a lot of the YouTube 

119
00:09:43,966 --> 00:09:49,966
videos I do, or personal productivity, maybe writing an email or a Facebook message.

120
00:09:49,966 --> 00:09:55,633
Now, if you're doing workflows correctly, you also have extended tools such as fine 

121
00:09:55,633 --> 00:10:01,200
tuning, retrieval, augmented generation, memory, human in the loop to interact with 

122
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,633
the AI, and maybe different models to solve different problems. So let's have a look 

123
00:10:06,633 --> 00:10:12,066
at it from a marketing agency point of view. So let's say you're a digital marketing 

124
00:10:12,066 --> 00:10:16,900
company and you've got a lot of workflows that you're doing for many clients. And 

125
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:21,066
it's the same workflows over and over again. And this was one such company I was 

126
00:10:21,066 --> 00:10:24,866
working with. And we were looking at the different workflows they've got and just 

127
00:10:24,866 --> 00:10:29,766
putting them into structured, prompt chains that they could run over and over again.

128
00:10:29,766 --> 00:10:33,666
Now, one of the things I found interesting about working with this company, that 

129
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:38,400
is that there's a lot of similarity between being a YouTuber, publishing LinkedIn 

130
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:49,600
articles and being an SEO agency, creating various forms of content. 
I also worked recently with a branding agency, and what they had put in place already 

131
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:55,366
was competitive analysis, market research tools in the form of prompt packs. And 

132
00:10:55,366 --> 00:10:59,900
these prompt packs were done in Canva. They had nice little video walkthroughs of 

133
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:04,366
how to use them, and they were quite simple in nature. Basically a bunch of prompts 

134
00:11:04,366 --> 00:11:09,600
that a customer could just copy paste into large language model of choice, maybe 

135
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,533
modify a few input variables. So this is a simplistic way of getting your first prompt 

136
00:11:15,533 --> 00:11:16,733
chains up and running.

137
00:11:16,733 --> 00:11:22,266
Now as a YouTuber, using prompt chains can be effective in all sorts of areas, like 

138
00:11:22,266 --> 00:11:27,733
creation and optimization of your content. You might want to repurpose and redistribute 

139
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:34,100
it as an article or as a carousel, or you might want to deal with analyzing the comments 

140
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:38,400
or building some sort of offer to a sponsorship deal.

141
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:43,733
So let's look at a tool I use internally called the Agent Workflow Builder to create 

142
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:48,866
videos. And one of the workflows I go through is the YouTube Launch Optimizer. It's 

143
00:11:48,866 --> 00:11:53,566
a 30 step workflow that I go through every time I release a video, but one of the 

144
00:11:53,566 --> 00:11:58,966
steps involved here is the YouTube titles. So when we were looking at the video at 

145
00:11:58,966 --> 00:12:05,100
the beginning of this session called the 5 5 5 Manifesto and the Mountain of Mastery, 

146
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:09,633
I would've run that through a title generator. I would've said the short title is 

147
00:12:09,633 --> 00:12:15,400
the 5 5 5 Manifesto. It's main topic is it's about spiral learning, and I would put 

148
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:19,633
in a couple of content highlights. Now, the good thing about this is it would run 

149
00:12:19,633 --> 00:12:25,300
a prompt through Chat GPT in this case, and we'd get a bunch of YouTube titles ready 

150
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,200
to get started. 

151
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:32,200
Now, personally, I use Vid IQ a lot when I want to use Title Generation, but what 

152
00:12:32,233 --> 00:12:37,833
I love about doing it within the age of Workflow Builder is I have full control over 

153
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:42,366
the way titles of being created. So I use it as a first pass, and then I finish off 

154
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:42,966
with Vid iq.

155
00:12:42,966 --> 00:12:48,900
So let's get into a more detailed workflow. Let's look at story building. And in 

156
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:52,766
the video that we saw at the beginning, it starts off with legends are forged in 

157
00:12:52,766 --> 00:12:57,366
the fires of the YouTube battlefield. Let's just play that for a second so that you 

158
00:12:57,366 --> 00:13:02,066
can see what it sounds like. Again, legends are forged in the fires of the YouTube 

159
00:13:02,233 --> 00:13:02,933
battlefield. 

160
00:13:02,933 --> 00:13:05,666
Only the strongest, the most persistent. 

161
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:10,300
And so you can see there that we've got nothing more than a transcript, and with 

162
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:14,900
this transcript we can run it through various processes. So the first one I wanna 

163
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:20,000
look at is the shot list that we talked about with the woman in New York, and we're 

164
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,066
doing some prompt engineering around coming up with shot lists. And one of the things 

165
00:13:24,066 --> 00:13:29,733
that you notice with a scene is that there's more than one concept going here. Firstly, 

166
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:34,400
we've got the scene itself is a mountain in the background, but in the foreground 

167
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:39,266
we've got two different ideas going on. Firstly, we've got the protagonist, the hero 

168
00:13:39,266 --> 00:13:44,566
in the story, in the red robes. The second thing we've got is a main artifact or 

169
00:13:44,566 --> 00:13:47,666
item. In this case, it happens to be a sword.

170
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:53,966
Now, the specific details are really important when you're generating graphics and 

171
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:58,666
prompts and stuff like that. So I start off with the primary character generator, 

172
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:03,600
and this is where I work through and solidify what the character is going to look 

173
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,900
like. After that, I'll look at the other characters that might be the villains, they 

174
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:13,400
might be the other characters within the story, and how do I get them consistently 

175
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:17,800
looking the same across different scenes? After that, I want to work on the scenes 

176
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:22,333
themselves. Can I come up with a style that's repeatable that I can reuse to get 

177
00:14:22,366 --> 00:14:26,100
nice effects? And one of the things that you see in a scene is there's all sorts 

178
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:31,200
of objects, but sometimes there's a major object, and the major object would be something 

179
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:36,933
like the 555 manifesto, where I want to define that and work through consistently 

180
00:14:36,933 --> 00:14:41,000
being able to reproduce it in various scenes of the video.

181
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,033
Now as an example, and we'll only talk about the primary character. I've developed 

182
00:14:46,033 --> 00:14:50,333
two different styles. So here I've put myself in a black shirt and I've run it through 

183
00:14:50,366 --> 00:14:55,700
style one and style two. I decided I liked style two more, but I didn't want to work 

184
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:59,266
with the black shirt, so I just took a different picture of myself 

185
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:04,133
And you can see that the image on the right was used in the Mountain of Mastery YouTube 

186
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:04,766
trailer.

187
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,500
Now we've crafting workflows out of the way. Let's look into the next two sections, 

188
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:17,200
which is AI agents and using low code tools. So an AI agent is an automation generally, 

189
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:22,700
but quite often we'll also do a human in the loop sort of visual interface. So when 

190
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:28,466
it comes to using Vidiq, we can see that a video that I did, I put in a title and 

191
00:15:28,466 --> 00:15:34,233
it said your score is only 66. But what it did was suggest better ones. And I went 

192
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:39,833
with the one that was 96. So this is a very simple human in the loop interface, backed 

193
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:45,633
by agent workflows such as the one that I build for myself. But another way of looking 

194
00:15:45,633 --> 00:15:50,166
at this, and this is where low code tools can come in, is that you can use a tool 

195
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:51,166
like pickaxe.

196
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:57,200
Now I've done four videos on this particular tool, but just as a recap, if we look 

197
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:04,033
at these little tools that are AI driven, such as the YouTube title generator, again, 

198
00:16:04,066 --> 00:16:07,900
working on similar principles to what we saw in the Agent Workflow Builder,, you 

199
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:13,366
can come along, fill in a little bit of information, and get a list of titles generated 

200
00:16:13,366 --> 00:16:18,233
or using a tool that you can market, you can reuse, you can give away to different 

201
00:16:18,233 --> 00:16:23,700
people. Another tool that I've done is the video advertisement script writer. And 

202
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:29,033
the idea of this is creating an advert script that converts. So you put in a few 

203
00:16:29,033 --> 00:16:33,433
inputs and here we've got the hook that says, "hey, yeah, you scrolling mindlessly, 

204
00:16:33,433 --> 00:16:39,233
still thinking of those get rich quick videos will save your ass. Spoiler alert they 

205
00:16:39,233 --> 00:16:45,133
won't." And that's a hook. 
We've got the pain in the villain, the reveal and then the call to action all at 

206
00:16:45,133 --> 00:16:45,866
the end of it.

207
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:52,266
So with the scale framework out of the way, let's move on to Emotional Support Spiders. 

208
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:57,333
And this is something that I came up with a couple of years ago working with ChatGPT,.

209
00:16:57,333 --> 00:17:02,600
And the idea was looking at the concept of emotional support animals or companion 

210
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:08,233
animals and doing it differently, doing it as a storytelling in a multiverse sort 

211
00:17:08,233 --> 00:17:13,833
of event. And so this is called Emotional Support Spiders. It's an idea in which 

212
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:18,600
there are two sentient races. You've got humans and you've got spiders. And what 

213
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:22,333
we're trying to do within it is create buddy stories.

214
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:33,000
this has been thought of from the very beginning as a multi-agent storytelling system, 
where each story can have irony and contrast. We can create trust and connection 

215
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,366
between two different characters that are quite different from one another. We can 

216
00:17:37,366 --> 00:17:43,100
explore concepts like truth and trauma, hopefully so that we can get inspiration 

217
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,333
and hope out of it all.

218
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,466
Now, from the multi-agent point of view, the images that you're seeing, which were 

219
00:17:48,466 --> 00:17:54,466
done in Midjourney a couple of years ago, were the idea, could you take individual 

220
00:17:54,500 --> 00:18:00,500
images of the spider and the human and create a story narrative back stories? Can 

221
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:06,166
we create forward stories? Join us stories where people come together to form relationships. 

222
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:11,766
And this is where various agents that arrive, a one off character related or storytelling, 

223
00:18:11,766 --> 00:18:14,200
are being reused over and over again.

224
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:19,633
So the way I start storytelling is from a world narrative. This is a set of one-off 

225
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:25,800
agents that define the world that we live in. And the first agent is around philosophical 

226
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:30,100
view of the world. Do I want to have a bit of Buddhism? Do I want some Christianity? 

227
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:34,900
Do I want something else? And the way I like to do this is have a simple human in 

228
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:39,466
the loop interface where I fill in a few values and then behind the scenes use an 

229
00:18:39,533 --> 00:18:46,166
agent workflow system such as NA 10 or Zapier to implement and build out all the 

230
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:52,166
information. After that, we can move on to a design and visualization agent. And 

231
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:57,100
when you look at the images in this screenshot at the moment, if we go back one and 

232
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:02,800
we see the spider and the man, and we've got all this stone work, it's a rock mural 

233
00:19:03,033 --> 00:19:07,766
sort of system. And this is going to be repeated through the next set of slides. 

234
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:14,633
And to do this, we need to get a design guide going. So we start off by another human 

235
00:19:14,633 --> 00:19:19,366
in the loop sort of input form, run it through a bunch of agents to come up with 

236
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:21,600
a consistent style that we want to use.

237
00:19:21,766 --> 00:19:26,333
Now. After that, we need to come up with a detailed fact sheet of what is a human 

238
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:32,033
and what is a spider. And you can think of it the same way as you might a role playing 

239
00:19:32,033 --> 00:19:36,366
game, a Dungeons and Dragons, where you've got these attribute sheets that make sense 

240
00:19:36,366 --> 00:19:41,100
for humans, and you've got a different attribute sheets that make sense for monsters 

241
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,233
as an example. 

242
00:19:42,233 --> 00:19:47,366
With our general worldview agents in place, especially this species traits one, we 

243
00:19:47,366 --> 00:19:52,766
can now move on to the character development itself. So if we are developing a human 

244
00:19:52,766 --> 00:19:57,033
character, one of the things that we wanna do is come up with the attributes, the 

245
00:19:57,033 --> 00:20:02,366
sort of stuff that happens when they're born. So with that, do we want to know what 

246
00:20:02,366 --> 00:20:07,700
their hair color is? The height that they grow to, what are their general fears and 

247
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:12,833
problems going on in life? What are their desires? We want to do this same concept 

248
00:20:12,866 --> 00:20:18,800
with the spiders themselves, and we use a different agent, mainly because the goals, 

249
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:23,200
the behaviors, they're going to be different between the two different species. With 

250
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:28,266
that in place, we can then start to build a timeline of where they are in life, so 

251
00:20:28,266 --> 00:20:30,166
they got born, but where are 

252
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:36,566
maybe we've got a human that's 13 years of age. Can we build up a storyline from 

253
00:20:36,566 --> 00:20:41,500
the attribute sheet all the way up to that period in time? Now, if we can do that, 

254
00:20:41,566 --> 00:20:47,100
we can then start to determine the sort of behaviors and mannerisms that each character 

255
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:47,733
has.

256
00:20:47,733 --> 00:20:53,000
Now, before we build any stories around these characters, a couple of additional 

257
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,633
agents that can be useful is that if a scene, a scenario, an action happens, how 

258
00:20:58,633 --> 00:21:05,033
does that change their behavior? What's their motivations? Do they lead into a positive 

259
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,633
sort of let's move forward in the world, or do they become a bit of a victim now, 

260
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:14,800
no matter what the mapping comes with, the next thing is to read that and put it 

261
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:20,266
back into the character. So if I have a confronting situation and I rise above it, 

262
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:25,800
how do we write that information back into the DNA of who I am as a character? 

263
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:31,100
With all our character development, our timelines in place, we can move on to scenario 

264
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:35,966
writing. And I like to have a different agent for the different types of scenarios 

265
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:41,066
that can happen in the Emotional Support Spiders world. So the first one is that 

266
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:45,366
when you've got two characters that have never met, what brings them together, and 

267
00:21:45,366 --> 00:21:50,800
usually that's a dramatic scene, such as a bird attacking the spider and a human 

268
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,333
coming in to save the spider. In this particular 

269
00:21:54,633 --> 00:21:59,566
Now that dramatic, emotionally charged scene can lead to a bonding. And with the 

270
00:21:59,566 --> 00:22:05,033
bonding, we can then go into them sharing their backstory, sharing what they've done, 

271
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:08,666
and finding commonality in hanging out with one another.

272
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:14,233
Now the Buddy story scenario is a classic in Hollywood. We've seen it in Lethal Weapon, 

273
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:19,833
Dumb and Dumber Bill and Ted's excellent adventure. So what I like to do is now that 

274
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:24,600
we've got this in place, how do these two characters move forward in the future? 

275
00:22:24,966 --> 00:22:30,500
And we do that using a new sort of writer that is more on an episode by episode basis 

276
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:35,900
or a day-to-day basis. And so the first one we have is what we saw when we were looking 

277
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:41,566
at the woman and her cat a day in the life story. So we do a scenario based story 

278
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:47,266
based on the idea that we have a world philosophical view. We had the design of the 

279
00:22:47,266 --> 00:22:51,866
world. We understand what a human and a spider is from a characteristics point of 

280
00:22:51,866 --> 00:22:52,266
view. 

281
00:22:52,266 --> 00:22:57,600
We now also have the individual profile or DNA of the spider and the human, their 

282
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:02,633
timeline, their backstory. We also know how they came together in traumatic fashion 

283
00:23:02,833 --> 00:23:08,100
to become friends. So now when we just paint a simple scene for a day in the life 

284
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:13,433
story, we've got all this rich information to drive it. After that, we wanna move 

285
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:18,133
into the actual shot list. Again, we did that with the woman and her cat. One of 

286
00:23:18,133 --> 00:23:22,733
the things that happens though, when you are doing shot lists, and we can use agents 

287
00:23:22,733 --> 00:23:29,033
to do this, is not all scenes will be correct. So let's say we wanted grays and oranges 

288
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:32,166
throughout every scene and we get one that's pink. 

289
00:23:32,166 --> 00:23:36,533
In this particular case, we will tell the agent and say, look, you got this one a 

290
00:23:36,533 --> 00:23:41,066
little bit incorrect. Can you regenerate the prompt so that we can regenerate the 

291
00:23:41,066 --> 00:23:41,733
images?

292
00:23:41,766 --> 00:23:46,333
So that gives you some context of how emotional support spiders are put together 

293
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:50,433
with different agents. The next thing is looking a little bit at the technicality 

294
00:23:50,433 --> 00:23:55,966
of it all, and it's really quite simple. What we do is we build little agent workflows. 

295
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,466
We can use tools like N 18 or we can code them directly in Python or JavaScript. 

296
00:24:01,733 --> 00:24:06,833
From there, we just need to hook 'em up to human in the loop interfaces. So when 

297
00:24:06,833 --> 00:24:11,466
we're building in the world philosophy, we'll run in a few pieces of information, 

298
00:24:11,466 --> 00:24:15,466
send it to a workflow. After that, we want to figure out what's this world going 

299
00:24:15,466 --> 00:24:20,166
to look like? It's just another workflow. When we get onto dealing with the human, 

300
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:28,566
this is on a per human basis or on a per spider basis, 
we're defining, how they look, what their motivations are. After that, we run both 

301
00:24:28,566 --> 00:24:34,333
workflows through the Backstory generator and we just continue to do this for each 

302
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:36,333
of the different agents that we're trying to build.

303
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:41,366
So with everything in place, the next thing is to create a story of some form and 

304
00:24:41,433 --> 00:24:47,033
the day in the life stories can look like this. Here we have a boy and an emotional 

305
00:24:47,033 --> 00:24:52,633
support spider in this particular case, and the boy has been invited to a party but 

306
00:24:52,633 --> 00:24:57,366
doesn't know how to associate with people. So from there, we add in a little bit 

307
00:24:57,366 --> 00:24:59,233
of a narrative over the top of it, 

308
00:24:59,266 --> 00:25:05,733
put in some magic animations sort of stuff that we can do in DZine or Leonardo ai. 

309
00:25:05,733 --> 00:25:11,033
I've got links in the description for both of them. And from there we simply animate 

310
00:25:11,133 --> 00:25:16,966
the scene. We've got the boy down at the beach and being befriended by a spider in 

311
00:25:16,966 --> 00:25:22,833
this particular case. Later on they're at his house where he's teaching them about 

312
00:25:22,833 --> 00:25:27,433
computer programming and stuff like that. Later in the day, there's a dramatic scene. 

313
00:25:27,633 --> 00:25:36,700
This time the father is angry upstairs, so there's a bit of comfort going 
and then we finish the scene with a little bit of hope. They're down at the beach 

314
00:25:36,733 --> 00:25:38,333
and they're playing together.

315
00:25:38,333 --> 00:25:45,066
So this was the presentation I gave over at Ecamm Live Leap last night, and it talks 

316
00:25:45,066 --> 00:25:50,233
about the scale framework, the structured prompts, creative workflows, the agents, 

317
00:25:50,233 --> 00:25:55,400
the low code frameworks, and how we put it together to empower creators. And then 

318
00:25:55,400 --> 00:26:00,633
moving on to the emotional support spiders, which is a system that's in developed 

319
00:26:00,633 --> 00:26:06,666
by myself so that I can do multi-agent storytelling. Now, if you wanna find out more 

320
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:11,566
about how the actual video structures are being put together, you can come over to 

321
00:26:11,566 --> 00:26:17,200
the A-I-T-L-D-R channel where we do a lot of videos that are all AI generated and 

322
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,466
there's a lot of storytelling going on. Or if you wanna learn more about the agent 

323
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:29,400
