Do you want to scale your storytelling using AI without losing the human touch? In this video
I'll walk you through some of the human in the loop AI automations that I use for storytelling
and YouTube automation. I'll introduce you to my core automation pillars, what I call the scale
framework and how I'm using that and tools like Agent Workflow Builder and Pickaxe to bring
content creation to life. But first let's kick off with an example, a cinematic trailer called
The Mountain of Mastery that's built using these workflows.
He has climbed the treacherous mountain of mastery where many have fallen. He has battled
burnout, braved the shadowbound swamps and faced the dreaded demonetization dungeon. He has studied
the sacred texts, viral thumbnails, retention graphs and every cat video in search of the
ultimate truth. Is he a genius? A madman? A man haunted by the ghosts of unfinished edits?
No one knows but one thing is certain. He won't stop until he finds the answer or loses his mind
trying. This is the ridiculous legend of Appetit and the 555 Manifesto. Now the rest of this talk
on the scale framework and the human in the loop agents was actually part of a talk I did last week
at Ecamm Live Tech Summit. If you want to find the full presentation you can see it down below.
Otherwise let's move on. Now we're going to look at crafting workflows and these are simple prompt
chains that you put in place to execute the same sort of instructions over and over again in a
systematic way and I like to use them in three main areas. Business optimization, creative processes
like you see in this presentation or in a lot of the YouTube videos I do or personal productivity
maybe writing an email or a Facebook message. Now if you're doing workflows correctly you also have
extended tools such as fine tuning, retrieval, augmented generation, memory, human in the loop
to interact with the AI and maybe different models to solve different problems. So let's have a look
at it from a marketing agency point of view. So let's say you're a digital marketing company
and you've got a lot of workflows that you're doing for many clients and it's the same workflows
over and over again and this was one such company I was working with and we were looking at the
different workflows they've got and just putting them into structured prompt chains that they could
run over and over again. Now one of the things I found interesting about working with this company
that is that there's a lot of similarity between being a YouTuber publishing LinkedIn articles
and being an SEO agency creating various forms of content. I also worked recently with a branding
agency and what they had put in place already was competitive analysis market research tools
in the form of prompt packs and these prompt packs were done in Canva they had nice little
video walkthroughs of how to use them and they were quite simple in nature basically a bunch
of prompts that a customer could just copy paste into large language model of choice
maybe modify a few input variables so this is a simplistic way of getting your first prompt chains
up running. Now as a YouTuber using prompt chains can be effective in all sorts of areas like creation
and optimization of your content you might want to repurpose and redistribute it as an article or as
carousel or you might want to deal with analyzing the comments or building
some sort of offer to a sponsorship deal. So let's look at a tool I use internally called
the agent workflow builder to create videos and one of the workflows I go through is the YouTube
launch optimizer it's a 30-step workflow that I go through every time I release a video but one of
the steps involved here is the YouTube titles so when we were looking at the video at the beginning
of this session called the 555 manifesto and the mountain of mastery I would have run that through
a title generator I would have said the short title is the 555 manifesto its main topic is
it's about spiral learning and I would put in a couple of content highlights now the good thing
about this is it would run a prompt through chat gpt in this case and we get a bunch of
YouTube titles ready to get started now personally I use vidIQ a lot when I want to use
title generation but what I love about doing it within the agent workflow builder is I have full
control over the way titles are being created so I use it as a first pass and then I finish off
with vidIQ. So let's get into a more detailed workflow let's look at story building and in the
video that we saw at the beginning it starts off with legends are forged in the fires of the
YouTube battlefield let's just play that for a second so that you can see what it sounds like
agents are forged in the fires of the YouTube battlefield only the strongest the most persistent
so you can see there that we've got nothing more than a transcript and with this transcript we can
run it through various processes so the first one I want to look at is the shot list that we
talked about with the woman in New York and we're doing some prompt engineering around coming up
with shot lists and one of the things that you notice with a scene is that there's more than one
concept going here firstly we've got the scene itself is a mountain in the background but in
the foreground we've got two different ideas going on firstly we've got the protagonist the hero in
the story in the red robes the second thing we've got is a main artifact or item in this case it
happens to be a sword now these specific details are really important when you're generating
graphics and prompts and stuff like that so I start off with the primary character generator
and this is where I work through and solidify what the character is going to look like after
that I'll look at the other characters that might be the villains they might be the other
characters within the story and how do I get them consistently looking the same across different
scenes after that I want to work on the scenes themselves can I come up with a style that's
repeatable that I can reuse to get nice effects and one of the things that you see in a scene is
there's all sorts of objects but sometimes there's a major object and the major object would be
something like the 555 manifesto where I want to define that and work through consistently being
able to reproduce it in various scenes of the video now as an example I will only talk about
the primary character I've developed two different styles so here I've put myself in a black shirt
and I've run it through style one and style two I decided I liked style two more but I didn't want
to work with the black shirt so I just took a different picture and you can see that the image
on the right was used in the mountain of mastery youtube trailer now with crafting workflows out
of the way let's look into the next two sections which is AI agents and using loco tools so an AI
agent is an automation generally but quite often will also do a human in the loop sort of visual
interface so when it comes to using vidIQ we can see that a video that I did I put in a title and
it said your score is only 66 but what it did was suggest better ones and I went with the one that
was 96 so this is a very simple human in the loop interface backed by agent workflows such as the one
that I build for myself but another way of looking at this and this is where low code tools can come
in is that you can use a tool like pickaxe now I've done four videos on this particular tool but
just as a recap if we look at these little tools that are AI driven such as the youtube title
generator again working on similar principles to what we saw in the age of workflow builder
you can come along fill in a little bit of information and get a list of titles generated
or using a tool that you can market you can reuse you can give away to different people
another tool that I've done is the video advertisement script writer and the idea of
this is creating an advert script that converts so you put in a few inputs and here we've got the
hook that says hey yeah you scrolling mindlessly still thinking of those get rich quick videos
will save your ass spoiler alert they won't and that's a hook we got the pain and the villain the
reveal and then the call to action all at the end of it so to recap that's the scale framework and
a couple of the human in the loop agent workflow systems that I'm using for visual storytelling
this was all spoken about at a tech summit recently for ecamm leap if you want to work
one-on-one with me then check out the link in the description otherwise in the next video what we're
going to do from the same presentation is talk about the scalable agent framework that I'm
starting to develop for the emotional support spiders storytelling system I'm happy Dave see
you in the next video
