1
00:00:00,366 --> 00:00:02,001
Good day. It's AppyDave.

2
00:00:02,001 --> 00:00:05,104
And today we're talking about using

3
00:00:05,104 --> 00:00:08,574
Claude artifacts and Claude widgets.

4
00:00:08,574 --> 00:00:12,077
And I'm here with Alec from Take One Tech.

5
00:00:12,077 --> 00:00:13,545
Good day, Alec, how are you, mate?

6
00:00:13,545 --> 00:00:15,213
Great to see you all. All good.

7
00:00:15,213 --> 00:00:15,813
Thank you.

8
00:00:15,813 --> 00:00:19,817
And, thank you for coming on
this live stream at the last minute.

9
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:23,387
I just,
this was just something I decided to do

10
00:00:23,487 --> 00:00:25,622
yesterday, asked if you wanted to come.

11
00:00:25,622 --> 00:00:27,524
You're on board.

12
00:00:27,524 --> 00:00:32,095
And, 
this is related to some conversations

13
00:00:32,095 --> 00:00:37,633
that we've been having around, vibe
coding, building applications on the fly

14
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:41,136
and potentially,
how can you build applications

15
00:00:41,136 --> 00:00:44,272
that we can use in live streams,
like what we're doing now.

16
00:00:44,372 --> 00:00:45,506
And also dealing with how

17
00:00:45,506 --> 00:00:50,277
we can build applications just to solve
different business related problems.

18
00:00:50,411 --> 00:00:53,647
But what's your take on
what's going on in the vibe coding,

19
00:00:53,647 --> 00:00:55,549
the Cloude code, the artifacts?

20
00:00:55,549 --> 00:00:57,784
What what's your knowledge of this
at the moment?

21
00:00:57,784 --> 00:01:00,053
Well,
certainly not as deep as yours.

22
00:01:00,053 --> 00:01:02,288
And that's why
I always value your opinions.

23
00:01:02,288 --> 00:01:03,622
Because you're someone who comes to this

24
00:01:03,622 --> 00:01:07,492
with, you know, extensive programing
experience already, so can,

25
00:01:07,559 --> 00:01:10,595
can actually see, the real time savings
that are involved with it.

26
00:01:10,595 --> 00:01:11,429
And I just,

27
00:01:11,429 --> 00:01:13,131
you know, know that
all those things that we've looked at,

28
00:01:13,131 --> 00:01:17,401
like in, group sessions that we've
had, it's been just amazing

29
00:01:17,401 --> 00:01:20,637
to see how quickly you can now
develop these sorts of things

30
00:01:20,637 --> 00:01:22,205
with, a few simple prompts.

31
00:01:22,205 --> 00:01:25,909
So yeah, excited to see where this goes.

32
00:01:26,309 --> 00:01:28,478
Okay, well, let's get into it.

33
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:30,913
What I've done is
I've set up a couple documents

34
00:01:30,913 --> 00:01:36,018
which hopefully will lead to success
in the creation of applications today.

35
00:01:36,251 --> 00:01:40,422
And the first one I've set up
is just a little live stream outline.

36
00:01:40,422 --> 00:01:43,124
And I'm just going to take a copy
of this information,

37
00:01:43,124 --> 00:01:45,726
and I'm going to head over to a Chat GPT

38
00:01:45,726 --> 00:01:49,696
window. But the document, that we're going
to be working with, the Cloude Artifacts

39
00:01:49,696 --> 00:01:52,966
live stream was made in Gemini,
and it's about knowing

40
00:01:52,966 --> 00:01:55,768
when to use the right tool
to solve the problem.

41
00:01:55,768 --> 00:01:59,071
So what I've done is
I've got a little project going called

42
00:01:59,071 --> 00:02:03,208
App-a-Day, because my goal is to be able
to build an application every day.

43
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:07,679
But what we're doing today is looking at
live widgets, live stream.

44
00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:09,747
And I've just started this conversation

45
00:02:09,747 --> 00:02:12,683
and we have access
to the live stream document,

46
00:02:12,683 --> 00:02:16,754
and we've also just grabbed
all the information around the outline.

47
00:02:16,954 --> 00:02:20,657
And what I'm going to do
is I'm just going to read this information

48
00:02:20,657 --> 00:02:23,226
and use it as a starting point.

49
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:25,695
Now, the information
that I've just dropped in here

50
00:02:25,695 --> 00:02:30,065
is basically a five point
outline of what I want to cover.

51
00:02:30,266 --> 00:02:33,935
So I'm just going to say,
can you just tell me what the first area

52
00:02:33,935 --> 00:02:36,938
that we're talking about
today is going to be about?

53
00:02:37,038 --> 00:02:40,875
And the reason I'm doing it
the way I'm doing it is that I want to

54
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:45,846
take the information dynamically,
however it comes out of ChatGPT

55
00:02:45,846 --> 00:02:49,182
or Gemini or Claude,
and I want to turn it into stuff.

56
00:02:49,182 --> 00:02:54,220
And in this case, maybe
we turn it into some sort of presentation

57
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:57,390
in Cloude, that might be a good way
to go, actually.

58
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:00,592
So like I said, it's
very fly by the seat of your pants.

59
00:03:00,826 --> 00:03:06,698
So the goal of this is the big picture
of widgets introduced to Claude artifacts.

60
00:03:07,098 --> 00:03:09,934
We're going to explain the completion

61
00:03:09,934 --> 00:03:13,137
code system, and we're going
to highlight the deployment,

62
00:03:14,605 --> 00:03:15,239
how it's

63
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:18,875
how you can deploy this
for free for content creators.

64
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:22,979
Now, best way to get started
is to build our first application.

65
00:03:23,179 --> 00:03:27,349
So I'm going to head over
to a little thumbnail that I created.

66
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:30,919
And right next to that we have Claude.

67
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:36,391
And in here I'm going to give it
a simple little instruction and says,

68
00:03:36,557 --> 00:03:37,959
I would like you to build

69
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:41,562
little Claude artifacts
for me, little micro applications.

70
00:03:41,729 --> 00:03:46,766
And the first one I want to do
is some sort of present and slide deck

71
00:03:47,067 --> 00:03:51,771
that tells people about what
we're doing in the live stream together.

72
00:03:52,004 --> 00:03:55,007
Here is the first piece of information.

73
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,542
And I'm going to get rid of the word first,

74
00:03:56,542 --> 00:03:59,544
because it's actually
the whole information.

75
00:03:59,745 --> 00:04:03,715
And what I'm hoping is going to happen
here is it's going to create

76
00:04:03,715 --> 00:04:06,717
a split pane window in a moment

77
00:04:06,717 --> 00:04:11,121
in which what we can see is code
being generated on the right,

78
00:04:11,522 --> 00:04:14,524
based on the information
that we entered in on the left.

79
00:04:14,691 --> 00:04:17,694
So essentially I created a pre prompt.

80
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,096
Pre prompt is
this is what I'd like you to do.

81
00:04:20,096 --> 00:04:22,231
I'd like you to create some artifacts.

82
00:04:22,231 --> 00:04:26,001
And then I just took the information
which was taken

83
00:04:26,001 --> 00:04:29,004
from the first part of my outline.

84
00:04:29,004 --> 00:04:33,775
And what Claude will start doing
is creating what's called a HTML document.

85
00:04:33,775 --> 00:04:37,912
We can see that this is starting
to show up as a presentation.

86
00:04:37,912 --> 00:04:40,914
It's got a class
called presentation going here.

87
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:43,984
So we have our first artifact created.

88
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:45,585
That is just mind blowing,

89
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:48,588
what's just happened.
It has just driven me insane.

90
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:50,156
Like it literally just wrote out

91
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:51,924
what you're looking at there, is not like,

92
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:55,494
I mean, it's a presentation,
but it's an HTML presentation.

93
00:04:55,494 --> 00:04:59,664
It's just being created with a, you know,
it's created the look and feel of it.

94
00:04:59,664 --> 00:05:03,768
It's created dynamically
moving background, going on

95
00:05:03,768 --> 00:05:04,569
there as well.

96
00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:07,538
And it was like seconds
it just it just spat it out.

97
00:05:07,538 --> 00:05:09,239
It was amazing. Amazing.

98
00:05:09,239 --> 00:05:10,874
let's test whether this works.

99
00:05:10,874 --> 00:05:13,576
And let's also test
the widget feature.

100
00:05:13,576 --> 00:05:15,878
So this is now a publishable link.

101
00:05:15,878 --> 00:05:18,881
I can go and click on this button
right here.

102
00:05:18,981 --> 00:05:22,318
And if I head back to the starting point.

103
00:05:22,318 --> 00:05:24,152
So everything started from here,

104
00:05:24,152 --> 00:05:28,523
I should actually be able
to just paste that URL in.

105
00:05:28,823 --> 00:05:30,124
What do we got here?

106
00:05:30,124 --> 00:05:34,628
Building with Claude artifacts, creating
micro applications in the life stream.

107
00:05:34,829 --> 00:05:35,930
but I like it.

108
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:38,498
And look at that,
look at these background animations.

109
00:05:38,498 --> 00:05:42,602
So one of the things, I love
when I watch your live streams,

110
00:05:42,602 --> 00:05:45,104
Alec, is the you've always
got these beautiful backgrounds,

111
00:05:45,104 --> 00:05:49,909
and mine are black, I think. Mine’s
really boring, but look at this.

112
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:53,245
It's created
this beautiful little rotating background.

113
00:05:53,245 --> 00:05:54,679
We got particles moving.

114
00:05:54,679 --> 00:05:57,715
We got a little bit of information
about what it is.

115
00:05:57,949 --> 00:05:59,550
And we've got these next patterns.

116
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:03,020
And everything is animating
in really cleanly.

117
00:06:03,387 --> 00:06:07,591
So there's the first application built.

118
00:06:07,591 --> 00:06:10,627
And I didn't know
what we were going to get.

119
00:06:10,627 --> 00:06:14,363
I was 95% confident it was going to work,

120
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:16,632
but it didn't know
what I was going to get.

121
00:06:16,632 --> 00:06:20,269
And I think that's one of the interesting
aspects of this technology

122
00:06:20,269 --> 00:06:23,271
is that I could ask it to generate
this one more time

123
00:06:23,472 --> 00:06:26,307
and get something, completely different.

124
00:06:26,307 --> 00:06:30,044
I now want to talk about how I actually do
coding.

125
00:06:30,044 --> 00:06:33,247
And I wouldn't usually do coding the way
we just saw.

126
00:06:33,447 --> 00:06:36,450
So I'm just going to kick in here and say,
can you tell me what

127
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:40,153
topic number two in the live stream is?

128
00:06:40,386 --> 00:06:41,621
And hopefully we're going to get

129
00:06:41,621 --> 00:06:44,657
a little bit of information
about the two persona model.

130
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,792
So the large language model is trained

131
00:06:46,792 --> 00:06:49,995
on a corpus of the entire internet
or whatever it is.

132
00:06:50,562 --> 00:06:52,330
So it's an expert in everything.

133
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:55,900
And so when it tries
to write out information for us,

134
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,636
it can come from any angle.

135
00:06:58,636 --> 00:07:02,539
So what we're trying to do is tell it
who it is, who it is in life,

136
00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:06,343
what's its behavior, what's its past
way of thinking, by training it and say,

137
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:10,546
okay, you are a software developer
specializing in a particular

138
00:07:10,546 --> 00:07:14,917
programing language, and it will think
and only access the stuff

139
00:07:14,917 --> 00:07:19,621
from its large language model in relation
to that when it gives it sentences.

140
00:07:19,788 --> 00:07:24,559
So it's just a really good way
of shaping the narrative, towards success.

141
00:07:24,692 --> 00:07:25,426
Right?

142
00:07:25,426 --> 00:07:27,361
But before we do that,
let's just jump back

143
00:07:27,361 --> 00:07:29,230
over to that little application we did.

144
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:33,233
So we had our little presentation
and we've got you down in the bottom

145
00:07:33,233 --> 00:07:35,402
left hand corner.
We can see your background.

146
00:07:35,402 --> 00:07:39,739
It's blues and it’s pinks and yellows,
and we can see it's just copied that.

147
00:07:39,972 --> 00:07:41,040
Exactly.

148
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:45,978
So I think the interesting thing is we've
created this presentation a second time.

149
00:07:46,111 --> 00:07:50,148
Not really any different, but we've
got your theme and branding in place.

150
00:07:50,382 --> 00:07:51,149
It is incredible.

151
00:07:51,149 --> 00:07:52,884
Yeah. I'm
glad it picked up on the background

152
00:07:52,884 --> 00:07:55,486
rather than my,
my pasty white, pudgy face.

153
00:07:58,022 --> 00:08:00,924
I would love to have seen
a silhouette of you in the background.

154
00:08:00,924 --> 00:08:04,961
What we'll do is we'll now
start defining who these people are.

155
00:08:04,961 --> 00:08:09,465
Now, one of the things that I've done
in this conversation ahead of time

156
00:08:09,465 --> 00:08:13,435
is I've loaded it up
with all the knowledge of best practices

157
00:08:13,936 --> 00:08:17,272
around Claude artifacts, Claude widgets,

158
00:08:17,405 --> 00:08:21,409
because Claude itself
can write code for anything but Claude

159
00:08:21,409 --> 00:08:25,746
widgets and artifacts
have a limited scope of what they can do.

160
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:28,649
So we want to ensure
that we don't go out of that.

161
00:08:28,649 --> 00:08:31,418
I would like you to create a requirement.

162
00:08:31,418 --> 00:08:34,354
Right. A product manager sort of role.

163
00:08:34,354 --> 00:08:36,856
I want you to think of it
from the point of view of

164
00:08:36,856 --> 00:08:38,491
if this was a job description

165
00:08:38,491 --> 00:08:41,760
that we went to the internet
and we had to write the job description,

166
00:08:41,794 --> 00:08:44,496
or if we were going to LinkedIn
and we were looking

167
00:08:44,496 --> 00:08:48,500
for a specific consultant,
what would they résumé look like?

168
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,268
What would their skills be?

169
00:08:50,268 --> 00:08:54,472
But what I want you to do as you write
this particular persona is

170
00:08:54,472 --> 00:08:57,608
I want you to ensure that it aligns

171
00:08:57,774 --> 00:09:00,777
with a document that you have access to,

172
00:09:00,911 --> 00:09:05,782
which gives the constraints of the types
of requirements that we can do.

173
00:09:05,982 --> 00:09:07,983
And here’s the document you're looking at.

174
00:09:07,983 --> 00:09:12,521
So all I've done is said,
create me a persona

175
00:09:12,521 --> 00:09:16,157
based on a job seeker résumé
or a LinkedIn consultant.

176
00:09:16,524 --> 00:09:19,527
And I've also said write it

177
00:09:19,827 --> 00:09:22,797
within the guidelines of Claude artifacts.

178
00:09:22,797 --> 00:09:26,934
And this was done using a combination
of open AI, deep research.

179
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,637
And then I took it over to Gemini Pro,

180
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:34,607
because Gemini Pro can deal
with big documents, and I just refined,

181
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:38,410
refined it a little bit for the live
stream, saved it into a file

182
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:41,780
on my computer, and I've just re uploaded
it back to the project.

183
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,350
And so now we actually have the job
description

184
00:09:45,517 --> 00:09:50,621
It's got things like it understands that
Claude doesn't have a big context window.

185
00:09:50,621 --> 00:09:53,590
It's only got about 8000 output tokens.

186
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:56,560
And what what
this actually means from our point of view

187
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,363
is that when we're creating artifacts,
it can't do big applications yet.

188
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:04,066
Every time I try to get it to do anything
complex, it fails.

189
00:10:04,066 --> 00:10:07,569
So one of the limitations
that we've baked into

190
00:10:07,603 --> 00:10:10,605
our persona is simple applications.

191
00:10:10,806 --> 00:10:13,641
One of the things
that were baked into it

192
00:10:13,641 --> 00:10:17,044
is that it can't access external APIs.

193
00:10:17,044 --> 00:10:21,315
So one of the things we can't do
with Claude artifacts right now

194
00:10:21,382 --> 00:10:24,418
is taught to say a flight's

195
00:10:24,418 --> 00:10:27,654
API or a Bitcoin stock price API.

196
00:10:27,721 --> 00:10:31,557
None of that's available,
but it does have one concept in there,

197
00:10:31,557 --> 00:10:35,194
and it's the ability
to talk to its completion model,

198
00:10:35,194 --> 00:10:39,731
which means the ability
to do conversational AI.

199
00:10:39,731 --> 00:10:42,467
That's actually built into the artifacts.

200
00:10:42,467 --> 00:10:43,568
And the good thing

201
00:10:43,568 --> 00:10:48,005
is that the person with this job title
knows exactly what they're allowed to do.

202
00:10:48,005 --> 00:10:49,607
So we've done that.

203
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:54,044
The second persona I need is the developer

204
00:10:54,478 --> 00:10:57,413
who is working with these requirements.

205
00:10:57,413 --> 00:11:01,450
What are the skills and capabilities
of this particular developer?

206
00:11:01,784 --> 00:11:06,455
You can look at what you came up with for
the requirements write up,

207
00:11:06,455 --> 00:11:09,824
but you can also go back to the
original documents found in.

208
00:11:11,092 --> 00:11:11,960
It's great.

209
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,161
And also that you're

210
00:11:13,161 --> 00:11:15,930
trying to solve one problem,
but it's not actually one problem.

211
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:19,066
It needs to be split down into this
two different components there.

212
00:11:19,066 --> 00:11:23,603
So, you know, splitting the two personas,
I think many would have just tried

213
00:11:23,603 --> 00:11:26,606
to think of what is I'm trying to do and,
and just get someone to do all of that.

214
00:11:26,606 --> 00:11:29,742
I'm going to show you
then how it works in reality.

215
00:11:29,742 --> 00:11:32,978
And what we'll do
is we'll bring up our Claude view,

216
00:11:33,012 --> 00:11:36,615
which we have from earlier,
and we can close that down.

217
00:11:36,615 --> 00:11:39,784
And we've got our conversation
going on here.

218
00:11:39,784 --> 00:11:45,156
Now we'll build our requirements for our
applications over here in the ChatGPT.

219
00:11:45,156 --> 00:11:48,959
And we'll do it
using the actual, requirements rather,

220
00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:53,163
but we'll take the persona
that we've created for the developer.

221
00:11:53,496 --> 00:11:55,798
And that's all here.

222
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:58,634
I'm just going to go down to the bottom,
and I'm going to press the little

223
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:00,236
copy button that's right here.

224
00:12:00,236 --> 00:12:03,105
And we're going to come over here and say,

225
00:12:03,105 --> 00:12:07,008
I need you to think
from the point of view of this person.

226
00:12:07,175 --> 00:12:11,279
I will be giving you requirements
later on for you to write software.

227
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,914
But please think from this point of view.

228
00:12:13,914 --> 00:12:18,252
And so we've essentially loaded up
the conversation with a way of thinking,

229
00:12:18,385 --> 00:12:18,885
that's it.

230
00:12:18,885 --> 00:12:24,123
And that said, since this is the
chat conversation where we write software,

231
00:12:24,123 --> 00:12:28,194
not come up with the requirements,
we don't need the requirements writer here.

232
00:12:28,194 --> 00:12:30,696
We only need the software developer here.

233
00:12:30,696 --> 00:12:33,498
So hopefully this is going to lead to

234
00:12:33,498 --> 00:12:36,501
some
good quality software development today.

235
00:12:36,568 --> 00:12:39,303
It means we can come back to this person

236
00:12:39,303 --> 00:12:43,674
and we'll say, we're moving on
to step number three in the live stream.

237
00:12:43,674 --> 00:12:47,811
And I believe it's around
thinking of categories of software

238
00:12:47,811 --> 00:12:51,214
that we can create
using the Cloud Artifact system.

239
00:12:51,514 --> 00:12:55,851
If you looked through this categories,
productivity and organization

240
00:12:55,851 --> 00:12:57,953
tools, visualization dashboards,

241
00:12:57,953 --> 00:13:00,222
games, educational learning aids.

242
00:13:00,222 --> 00:13:02,691
Is there anything here that resonates

243
00:13:02,691 --> 00:13:05,693
for you in the sort of live streams
that you do?

244
00:13:05,794 --> 00:13:07,829
A really obvious one is countdown timer.

245
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:10,431
I mean, I don't actually use countdowns
on my live stream,

246
00:13:10,431 --> 00:13:11,966
but it is an obvious one.

247
00:13:11,966 --> 00:13:15,402
Maybe a Q&A, although it depends on
how people would interact with that.

248
00:13:15,569 --> 00:13:17,971
Let's look at the widgets
and the countdown timer.

249
00:13:17,971 --> 00:13:22,275
And when we think about countdown timers,
I know we're thinking,

250
00:13:22,275 --> 00:13:25,244
we're generally thinking about it
at the beginning of a live stream.

251
00:13:25,244 --> 00:13:27,713
Count count count, live stream starts.

252
00:13:27,713 --> 00:13:32,651
But, I think another really useful idea
of a countdown timer

253
00:13:32,651 --> 00:13:37,188
is some sort of call to action
in the middle of a live stream.

254
00:13:37,355 --> 00:13:41,325
Person is going to win
a competition in 100 seconds.

255
00:13:41,492 --> 00:13:43,227
And it's just counting down.

256
00:13:43,227 --> 00:13:46,129
And we're seeing it
as some sort of widget in the live stream.

257
00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:49,999
Or we might say in 10s, I'm going to tell you
the five most important Claude

258
00:13:49,999 --> 00:13:51,367
artifact rules.

259
00:13:51,367 --> 00:13:54,036
Okay,
so I think that's what we're going to run

260
00:13:54,036 --> 00:13:56,739
with. So I'm going to come here
and I'm going to say.

261
00:13:56,739 --> 00:14:01,743
I need you to act
as the requirements writer,

262
00:14:01,843 --> 00:14:03,878
and I need you to write a requirements.

263
00:14:03,878 --> 00:14:06,847
We're going to do a widgets
for live streamers

264
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:12,352
and YouTubers sort of application.
One of the things to be aware of

265
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:13,954
is that this will be embedded

266
00:14:13,954 --> 00:14:17,991
directly into live streams
that can support chroma keys.

267
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:23,429
And so we must have a background so that
we can see the rest of the live stream.

268
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:27,432
And what we're thinking of doing here
is a countdown timer.

269
00:14:27,432 --> 00:14:33,004
But the countdown timer
is going to be towards a call to action

270
00:14:33,371 --> 00:14:38,742
in which people will find out
what the five amazing tips

271
00:14:38,909 --> 00:14:44,781
for using Claude powered applications
or creating Claude powered applications.

272
00:14:45,115 --> 00:14:48,117
How would you write this requirements
document?

273
00:14:48,217 --> 00:14:51,353
We've got the powered countdown teaser

274
00:14:51,353 --> 00:14:54,790
for live streamers. Category, author, purpose.

275
00:14:55,023 --> 00:14:57,859
So OBS, StreamYard.

276
00:14:57,859 --> 00:15:01,262
We're using Ecamm live,
we got a chroma key background.

277
00:15:01,562 --> 00:15:05,533
We've got some sort of countdown
timer, call to action.

278
00:15:05,533 --> 00:15:08,102
Amazing tips.
So that's what's going to happen.

279
00:15:08,102 --> 00:15:11,838
We're going to use tailwind CSS,
which is a styling framework

280
00:15:11,838 --> 00:15:15,942
for web applications
with a little bit of animations going on

281
00:15:15,942 --> 00:15:16,943
apparently.

282
00:15:16,943 --> 00:15:17,477
I like it.

283
00:15:17,477 --> 00:15:22,915
I'm just going to copy it
verbatim and head over to our Claude

284
00:15:22,915 --> 00:15:26,551
powered conversation
and say, I'd like you to create

285
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:29,153
the following application. The only thing

286
00:15:29,153 --> 00:15:32,890
different to the requirements
is that it's a ten second timer.

287
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:38,662
As a developer, you need to remember
from now on

288
00:15:38,662 --> 00:15:42,098
that when you're using external libraries

289
00:15:42,098 --> 00:15:45,668
that you should be using CDNJS.

290
00:15:46,102 --> 00:15:49,038
And what happened
is that we've got a working

291
00:15:49,038 --> 00:15:52,908
application here,
but you can see it's not really working.

292
00:15:52,908 --> 00:15:56,578
And I believe that that's
the actual problem we just ran into.

293
00:15:56,878 --> 00:16:01,148
So can you update our code
to fix the styling issues?

294
00:16:01,515 --> 00:16:01,782
Okay.

295
00:16:01,782 --> 00:16:06,753
So it's just rewriting it and it's now
using Cloudflare and there we go.

296
00:16:07,054 --> 00:16:10,056
we've got some confetti. Okay.

297
00:16:10,523 --> 00:16:14,227
Can you make sure that the actual message
“five amazing tips

298
00:16:14,227 --> 00:16:18,697
for Claude” doesn't happen
until the countdown timer happens.

299
00:16:19,064 --> 00:16:22,300
If this works,
I've got a little calculator overlay

300
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,303
kicking into place, and I do.

301
00:16:25,336 --> 00:16:28,539
And this is a widget
overlay in Ecamm, which allows you

302
00:16:28,539 --> 00:16:32,610
to just bring in any HTML, well,
effectively any HTML web page.

303
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:35,178
But originally it was designed
specifically for HTML widgets.

304
00:16:35,178 --> 00:16:38,081
But now any HTML can be brought in.

305
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:41,684
What I've come over to our system here
is

306
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:44,820
I've gone up to this little button
called publish.

307
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:49,758
And in clicking that you have access
to the public URL that anyone can access.

308
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:55,530
So I'm just copying the link here
and I'm going to go back over to my scenes

309
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:59,133
and replace the URL and press save.

310
00:16:59,366 --> 00:17:02,636
And so hopefully, okay that works.

311
00:17:02,636 --> 00:17:04,037
Now we've got one other problem.

312
00:17:04,037 --> 00:17:07,374
And that's the chroma key. Okay.

313
00:17:07,707 --> 00:17:11,244
So obviously
I need a little bit of improvement,

314
00:17:11,277 --> 00:17:14,680
but this was one of the things
that I actually wanted to do.

315
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:18,784
One of the things I wanted to be able
to do with this sort of technology

316
00:17:18,784 --> 00:17:23,388
was create the presentations on the fly
like we did, just based off raw data,

317
00:17:23,688 --> 00:17:27,758
like create some data, search
for some data with perplexity and go,

318
00:17:28,058 --> 00:17:32,729
now I've got a presentation and have it
just cleanly fit within to the

319
00:17:32,829 --> 00:17:34,431
live stream as you were going.

320
00:17:34,431 --> 00:17:39,102
So that's the goal of that. So,
here we go to our ten second countdown.

321
00:17:39,135 --> 00:17:41,170
Something amazing is going to happen.

322
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:42,771
A little bit of a line artifact.

323
00:17:44,206 --> 00:17:46,174
We're in the final moment and kaboom!

324
00:17:46,174 --> 00:17:49,211
We got some confetti
and we got messaging coming down.

325
00:17:49,544 --> 00:17:53,081
Another thing to develop
could be, an agenda on screen.

326
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:56,117
So let's say you've got a live stream
and you want to go through like

327
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:59,119
a series of agenda items on the screen,

328
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,821
you know,
is that something that could be created

329
00:18:00,821 --> 00:18:04,657
so that, you know, you have
a, almost like the bulleted list

330
00:18:04,657 --> 00:18:08,561
instead of having a full on presentation,
but just something that was, you know,

331
00:18:08,895 --> 00:18:12,531
point one, point two, point three?
I'd be able to sort of move through those

332
00:18:12,531 --> 00:18:14,466
that that could be
another cool thing to try.

333
00:18:14,466 --> 00:18:16,268
That would be, straightforward.

334
00:18:16,268 --> 00:18:17,502
Let's test it.

335
00:18:17,502 --> 00:18:21,372
Let's come to here and say, okay.

336
00:18:21,372 --> 00:18:24,308
You're acting from the point of view
of the requirements writer.

337
00:18:24,308 --> 00:18:29,880
And we've just come up with an idea
of an agenda items in a live stream.

338
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,983
Now, since we're in the middle
of a live stream in which you already

339
00:18:32,983 --> 00:18:37,253
understand
the five items that we want to cover,

340
00:18:37,587 --> 00:18:40,322
we'd like this widget

341
00:18:40,322 --> 00:18:44,726
to have the capability to say,
what point are we on

342
00:18:44,993 --> 00:18:46,761
and maybe a little tab control.

343
00:18:46,761 --> 00:18:51,232
What's a tab control
that I can just click on on screen

344
00:18:51,499 --> 00:18:55,002
and it takes us to the next agenda item.

345
00:18:55,202 --> 00:18:58,505
So before you actually write
the requirements documents,

346
00:18:58,772 --> 00:19:01,541
just give me what are the five agenda

347
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:04,644
items that we're planning
to talk about in this live stream

348
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:09,148
and how do you see the user interface
working?

349
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,950
Keep in mind that it's a live stream.

350
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:14,419
We don't have generally the simple

351
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:17,822
techniques and powerful techniques
that we have in a web application.

352
00:19:17,822 --> 00:19:22,526
So it's going to be really easy to use,
maybe like hotspots on the screen

353
00:19:22,526 --> 00:19:26,997
that when we press it changes
the context of what the agenda is about.

354
00:19:27,364 --> 00:19:31,501
Big picture, personas, application
categories, live fields,

355
00:19:31,501 --> 00:19:34,871
which we're doing at the moment
and polish round.

356
00:19:34,871 --> 00:19:35,705
Okay.

357
00:19:35,705 --> 00:19:39,942
So five minimalistic buttons at the bottom
or top of the screen.

358
00:19:40,242 --> 00:19:43,878
This sounds good because I've seen
some of your live streams

359
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:48,483
where you do it in keynote,
I think, and you had this sort of effect,

360
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:51,085
and I know you're not pressing
anybody in this.

361
00:19:51,085 --> 00:19:54,988
I know it changes automatically,
but this is where

362
00:19:54,988 --> 00:19:58,191
I'd like to be able to have it
be a little bit more dynamic.

363
00:19:58,191 --> 00:20:00,760
Can you write this
for our developer please?

364
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,060
Okay.

365
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,896
We've got our requirements document
being created here,

366
00:20:03,896 --> 00:20:08,333
and we will hand that over
to the developer in a second.

367
00:20:08,834 --> 00:20:11,836
So that's still coming through.

368
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:16,908
And then what we're going to do
is kick off another little widget.

369
00:20:16,908 --> 00:20:21,779
So I've just press copy here and
I said, can you create this application.

370
00:20:21,912 --> 00:20:26,816
Please
remember the rules about using CDNJS.

371
00:20:27,283 --> 00:20:29,686
The interesting thing about this
you mentioned there about like, you know,

372
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:30,653
the developer should know

373
00:20:30,653 --> 00:20:34,156
what you're essentially doing though is
although we're doing this all on the fly

374
00:20:34,156 --> 00:20:37,859
for this one particular task,
you're actually building up like your

375
00:20:37,859 --> 00:20:40,862
your virtual team, effectively, of you
would have your developer,

376
00:20:40,862 --> 00:20:41,863
you would have your,

377
00:20:41,863 --> 00:20:45,299
you know, graphic designer and you're
kind of building up a virtual team.

378
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:48,869
And as you find these, you can sort of
tweak them and update them and add them

379
00:20:48,869 --> 00:20:52,673
as you go it just in the same way that
if you had a real team of real people,

380
00:20:52,906 --> 00:20:55,809
you would,
you know, along the way, be instructing

381
00:20:55,809 --> 00:20:58,778
and educating on I'll do it this way
going forward and so on.

382
00:20:58,778 --> 00:21:03,349
Yeah. In fact we might even, if we get time,
we might even jump down to Cloude code.

383
00:21:03,549 --> 00:21:06,051
Yeah, we should
we should just we should do that

384
00:21:06,051 --> 00:21:08,620
rather than doing it here
for the next idea.

385
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,422
So that's in the middle of writing code.

386
00:21:10,422 --> 00:21:12,490
Let's just come back to here and say,

387
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:14,825
I need a new application, this time

388
00:21:14,825 --> 00:21:18,762
I need a flip card style of application
and what the flip card

389
00:21:18,762 --> 00:21:23,800
style of application is going to do
is teach me how to speak Thai.

390
00:21:24,134 --> 00:21:29,438
Now I'm also going to have a Thai partner
communicate with me

391
00:21:29,505 --> 00:21:32,508
and that person needs to learn
how to speak English.

392
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:37,112
So any phrase that we use should present
three concepts.

393
00:21:37,112 --> 00:21:40,148
It should present the phrase in English.

394
00:21:40,315 --> 00:21:43,184
It should present the phrase in Thai.

395
00:21:43,184 --> 00:21:48,188
It should present the phrase
in Thai phonetics because that's actually

396
00:21:48,188 --> 00:21:51,725
what I'm going to read
to try and sound out the Thai words.

397
00:21:52,025 --> 00:21:56,329
And because Thai words are out of order
with English words,

398
00:21:56,462 --> 00:22:01,166
I also need some sort of panel,
table of contents,

399
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:06,371
if you will, that shows a matching
of the English word to the Thai word.

400
00:22:06,371 --> 00:22:07,939
So left and right.

401
00:22:07,939 --> 00:22:10,375
I need this to be stylish.
I need it to be beautiful.

402
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:13,344
Let's go with a light blue motif.

403
00:22:13,344 --> 00:22:16,046
It's a flip card sort of thing. So what

404
00:22:16,046 --> 00:22:20,083
we see early on in
the piece is just the phrase

405
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:23,486
that we need to see
in these different things.

406
00:22:23,753 --> 00:22:27,256
If we click on it,
it should roll over with an animation,

407
00:22:27,456 --> 00:22:30,559
and we should see the detailed fact

408
00:22:30,592 --> 00:22:33,595
sheet of all the other language stuff.

409
00:22:33,628 --> 00:22:38,366
It should support ten
different conversation phrases,

410
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:40,401
and we should be able to go

411
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:43,671
to the next one
and to the previous one and test it out.

412
00:22:43,937 --> 00:22:45,639
Please write a requirement.

413
00:22:45,639 --> 00:22:47,774
So we'll let that write it's requirement.

414
00:22:47,774 --> 00:22:52,412
While that's happening,
we can see that this little application

415
00:22:52,845 --> 00:22:56,882
that we've got built before
and we won’t to test it here.

416
00:22:56,882 --> 00:23:01,019
What we'll do is we'll click
the publish button and go to copy

417
00:23:01,386 --> 00:23:06,758
and we'll head back over to I think
this window is where we're testing things.

418
00:23:06,824 --> 00:23:12,629
So current topic is the kick off and looks
like I go to press a little button here.

419
00:23:12,963 --> 00:23:14,765
And I can now interact with it.

420
00:23:14,765 --> 00:23:16,266
Oh that's nice.

421
00:23:17,334 --> 00:23:20,436
I like how it's got
the subtle animation as well on the button

422
00:23:20,436 --> 00:23:21,337
that's active.

423
00:23:21,337 --> 00:23:24,340
There's just a little bit of
a little animation going on there as well.

424
00:23:24,607 --> 00:23:26,275
That is really cool.

425
00:23:26,275 --> 00:23:26,909
Yeah.

426
00:23:26,909 --> 00:23:30,312
With this, obviously, you could position
that wherever you wanted it on screen.

427
00:23:30,312 --> 00:23:32,514
But you just said it right.

428
00:23:32,514 --> 00:23:36,617
Let's come back here
and say, we love it.

429
00:23:36,617 --> 00:23:40,454
But what be really nice
is that there's a panel over on the right

430
00:23:40,454 --> 00:23:43,457
that shows details about the topic.

431
00:23:43,724 --> 00:23:44,358
At the moment

432
00:23:44,358 --> 00:23:46,459
you've got that panel down the bottom,

433
00:23:46,459 --> 00:23:48,828
but it'd be nice
if it was over on the right.

434
00:23:48,828 --> 00:23:52,198
I don't think this did a good job
right here, but we'll come back to it.

435
00:23:52,198 --> 00:23:55,634
But I'm going to kick off
a new application for us.

436
00:23:55,768 --> 00:24:01,272
Can you create a new application for me
and we need ten Thai phrases in it.

437
00:24:01,272 --> 00:24:05,977
Can one of those phrases be,
“where have you been today?”

438
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:09,313
From a male point of view?

439
00:24:09,647 --> 00:24:12,382
While it's writing that code,
we'll just go back

440
00:24:12,382 --> 00:24:15,485
to our live stream agenda agent and

441
00:24:15,685 --> 00:24:20,156
we go publish.
We will just kick off this application again.

442
00:24:20,156 --> 00:24:25,727
And I'm just going to update and see what... 
and it worked.

443
00:24:25,727 --> 00:24:28,296
Okay. That worked.
It did.

444
00:24:28,763 --> 00:24:30,932
So this time
what I'll do is I'll just, I'm going

445
00:24:30,932 --> 00:24:32,533
to click the publish button again.

446
00:24:32,533 --> 00:24:35,369
I'm not going to go through the pain
of setting up widgets.

447
00:24:35,369 --> 00:24:38,939
Instead,
what I'm going to do is just go over

448
00:24:38,939 --> 00:24:43,209
to our GPT view
and just paste it into a browser.

449
00:24:43,209 --> 00:24:46,412
So in the browser
we've got our little application.

450
00:24:46,412 --> 00:24:50,616
Looks like I've picked the wrong one,
we’ll copy the correct URL

451
00:24:51,517 --> 00:24:53,852
and see whether that works.

452
00:24:53,852 --> 00:24:54,720
We got it.

453
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,857
So here we got our Thai English Trainer
application and it's in light blue.

454
00:24:59,157 --> 00:25:00,892
Hello, how are you?

455
00:25:02,059 --> 00:25:03,394
I'm just wondering.

456
00:25:03,394 --> 00:25:05,529
Click to flip. What does that do?

457
00:25:05,529 --> 00:25:10,300
Okay, so partly this application
doesn't work, which is great,

458
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,403
because it shows us
how we can fix things.

459
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:17,073
So if we come here
and we say, the application

460
00:25:17,073 --> 00:25:21,910
that you just created for the Thai
English language trainer does not work

461
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:26,548
correctly. At the moment,
it shows the complete card

462
00:25:26,915 --> 00:25:30,284
face up and the click to flip
does not work at all.

463
00:25:30,751 --> 00:25:35,522
And partly it's because there's some sort
of console error message going on.

464
00:25:35,723 --> 00:25:38,759
I'm going to give you access
to the console error message.

465
00:25:39,092 --> 00:25:42,896
And the other thing I notice
is that there's no table

466
00:25:43,296 --> 00:25:47,666
showing the English word
matching to the Thai word.

467
00:25:48,167 --> 00:25:51,270
So we take
this will go down to this console.

468
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:53,305
I'm not sure what we're seeing here.

469
00:25:53,305 --> 00:25:55,407
We've got some errors going on.

470
00:25:55,407 --> 00:25:58,176
We'll just paste this information in

471
00:25:58,176 --> 00:26:02,046
and we'll just see
what it can render for us.

472
00:26:03,514 --> 00:26:05,449
We've got flip card that

473
00:26:05,449 --> 00:26:07,684
allow us to go backwards and forwards.

474
00:26:07,684 --> 00:26:09,085
This is okay.

475
00:26:09,085 --> 00:26:10,353
Publish that.

476
00:26:10,353 --> 00:26:12,922
I've done this before.
They worked really well.

477
00:26:12,922 --> 00:26:15,358
But in the live stream
they're not going to work really well.

478
00:26:15,358 --> 00:26:17,059
And I'm not going to do it that it's done.

479
00:26:17,059 --> 00:26:19,928
It's always the way.

480
00:26:19,928 --> 00:26:21,963
But, wherever you been...

481
00:26:22,197 --> 00:26:26,367
Actually I should, because you probably know,
is this correct?

482
00:26:28,102 --> 00:26:29,904
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

483
00:26:29,904 --> 00:26:30,771
Okay.

484
00:26:30,771 --> 00:26:34,908
I'm using this sort of technique
to learn Thai at the moment.

485
00:26:34,908 --> 00:26:38,078
And the great thing is I can just come up

486
00:26:38,078 --> 00:26:41,080
with new phrases, add aminos, flip cards,

487
00:26:41,247 --> 00:26:45,017
and deal with the fact that even
when I've read a statement like,

488
00:26:45,251 --> 00:26:46,752
we'll get back.

489
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:51,389
I go, well, what word means “understand”?

490
00:26:51,389 --> 00:26:54,592
I, like, I don't know, I can't look at that
and know which one it is.

491
00:26:54,826 --> 00:26:57,595
I can guess that it's “understand”

492
00:26:57,595 --> 00:27:00,664
in this context, but quite often
they're around in a different order.

493
00:27:00,664 --> 00:27:03,467
And this is why I like to have a
the table of contents.

494
00:27:03,467 --> 00:27:05,235
It also maps the words.

495
00:27:06,102 --> 00:27:06,403
Yeah.

496
00:27:06,403 --> 00:27:07,971
Just not working here today.

497
00:27:07,971 --> 00:27:11,707
It's just mind blowing, like how quickly
all of this can be created.

498
00:27:11,707 --> 00:27:14,510
And these are just simple demonstrations.

499
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:18,413
With, in a relatively short space of time,
taking basically the first pass,

500
00:27:18,413 --> 00:27:20,915
but with just a few little tweaks here
and there,

501
00:27:20,915 --> 00:27:23,785
you know, you could create an entire

502
00:27:23,785 --> 00:27:27,354
set of fully branded, cohesive,

503
00:27:27,455 --> 00:27:28,956
you know,
whether they're widgets, overlays

504
00:27:28,956 --> 00:27:31,959
that you want to use in your live stream,
whether it's a suite of tools that you're

505
00:27:31,959 --> 00:27:35,895
going to use as part of your business
or content creation or whatever it is.

506
00:27:36,262 --> 00:27:36,963
Yeah.

507
00:27:36,963 --> 00:27:39,599
It's just kind of, 
kind of mind blowing, really.

508
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:39,966
Yeah.

509
00:27:39,966 --> 00:27:44,236
And, I'm only just getting into
using these myself and

510
00:27:44,236 --> 00:27:45,704
that was a new capability

511
00:27:45,704 --> 00:27:47,439
I was just reading about it today.

512
00:27:47,439 --> 00:27:49,574
The Claude complete stuff.

513
00:27:49,574 --> 00:27:52,543
It didn't work for us,
which is a little bit unfortunate.

514
00:27:52,577 --> 00:27:57,181
What I've found, though, is that
for a first pass, this is just perfect.

515
00:27:57,281 --> 00:27:59,516
I think it's been a great,
a great demo of

516
00:27:59,516 --> 00:28:01,651
just how
you can build these things out on the fly

517
00:28:01,651 --> 00:28:03,553
and just a little glimpse
of what's possible,

518
00:28:03,553 --> 00:28:08,090
but really, it's just whatever, whatever
people can imagine is now, certainly

519
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:11,894
within grasp in, you know, a
relatively short space of time.

520
00:28:11,894 --> 00:28:13,028
It's just a phenomenal.

521
00:28:13,028 --> 00:28:13,595
Yeah.

522
00:28:13,595 --> 00:28:18,066
And what we're seeing today would have
been difficult three months ago.

523
00:28:18,066 --> 00:28:22,436
So the coding AI pair program
has been going from strength to strength

524
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:24,105
over the last two years.

525
00:28:24,105 --> 00:28:28,675
But to say what we did
today would have been very difficult

526
00:28:28,675 --> 00:28:30,110
to do three months ago.

527
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:31,778
And even though we’re seeing problems,

528
00:28:31,778 --> 00:28:32,812
I think in six months

529
00:28:32,812 --> 00:28:36,115
time we're not going to have
any of those problems. In six months time

530
00:28:36,115 --> 00:28:42,521
any application that you want to build
that's small in nature will be possible.

531
00:28:42,588 --> 00:28:45,056
You won't need, you know, coding,
and you won't have to worry

532
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:46,725
too much about the errors.

533
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,626
They'll just all resolve themselves.

534
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:51,829
And maybe a year or two from now,
big enterprise applications

535
00:28:51,829 --> 00:28:55,733
will totally be within reach
for the average person as well.

536
00:28:55,999 --> 00:28:57,768
Exciting, exciting stuff.

537
00:28:57,768 --> 00:28:59,536
Well, we'll leave it at that.

538
00:28:59,536 --> 00:29:02,672
My name's AppyDave. David.
