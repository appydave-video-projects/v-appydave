1
00:00:00,011 --> 00:00:03,465
In this video, what I want to do is just take you through some

2
00:00:03,466 --> 00:00:08,599
examples of what's coming in the form of animated

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:13,173
diagrams, charts, ah, it's great for educational sort of

4
00:00:13,174 --> 00:00:16,126
stuff. Uhm, and I'll,

5
00:00:16,127 --> 00:00:19,842
I'll do it by showing this example. So this example is a video that

6
00:00:19,843 --> 00:00:24,075
Mary did, based on an image I saw.

7
00:00:24,076 --> 00:00:26,214
Over it in Facebook,

8
00:00:26,232 --> 00:00:30,329
so people are often doing the top 10 ways to do whatever.

9
00:00:30,678 --> 00:00:34,925
And they're usually just this grid and they list all the tools.

10
00:00:35,391 --> 00:00:37,797
Now, I said to her, we need,

11
00:00:37,798 --> 00:00:41,631
ah, this is a, it's called a listicle in article writing,

12
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,275
ah, so a list article listicle.

13
00:00:44,592 --> 00:00:47,638
And, um, she put together this video.

14
00:00:47,639 --> 00:00:50,783
The, the, the information is pretty good, but it has a few problems.

15
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:55,725
Um, so when we hit play on this and it's got the AI

16
00:00:55,726 --> 00:01:00,357
talking about it, VO three is the undisputed champ while open AI is

17
00:01:00,358 --> 00:01:02,367
4.0 is your go-to for now.

18
00:01:02,368 --> 00:01:06,925
I'll just turn off the sound. What's happening is that we've got categories on

19
00:01:06,926 --> 00:01:10,998
the left and we got the, what tool you use so we can see

20
00:01:10,999 --> 00:01:13,135
it. It's kind of this, emerging thing.

21
00:01:13,509 --> 00:01:18,152
Now there's a few problems. So you might've noticed it just shifted

22
00:01:18,153 --> 00:01:23,541
position and that's because at some stage during the presenting,

23
00:01:23,595 --> 00:01:27,300
presenting of the graphics, Mary would have duplicated a page.

24
00:01:27,301 --> 00:01:31,495
Then she would have shifted something by accident and not noticed it.

25
00:01:31,698 --> 00:01:34,721
So this sort of, uh,

26
00:01:34,731 --> 00:01:38,388
floor in the, um, in the aesthetics is,

27
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:40,798
uh, it's, it's a bit of a pain.

28
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,824
Um, it's not something that we want to do.

29
00:01:42,825 --> 00:01:45,814
You can even see it in a few areas here where you've got these

30
00:01:45,815 --> 00:01:50,170
lines that aren't quite aligned in these two positions.

31
00:01:50,639 --> 00:01:55,250
Now there's also a bunch of other challenges when building these sorts of

32
00:01:55,251 --> 00:01:58,220
screens. So first is, if we wanted to change the style,

33
00:01:58,221 --> 00:02:00,336
it's very problematic because it's about,

34
00:02:00,337 --> 00:02:03,806
20 different slides to do this,

35
00:02:03,807 --> 00:02:05,966
um, visual that you're seeing,

36
00:02:06,146 --> 00:02:08,348
right? So you've got essentially,

37
00:02:08,349 --> 00:02:10,455
uh, 10 different concepts,

38
00:02:10,603 --> 00:02:15,381
but you generally got two slides per concept to deal with the animation.

39
00:02:15,646 --> 00:02:18,461
Now, if you wanted advanced animations,

40
00:02:18,462 --> 00:02:21,543
like highlighting anything, then we don't even bother.

41
00:02:21,544 --> 00:02:24,395
It's just too hard. So this is,

42
00:02:24,396 --> 00:02:27,054
an idea of, um, an autumn,

43
00:02:27,386 --> 00:02:30,483
something that could be automated, but how do you do that?

44
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,764
And that's what I want to talk about in this video. I want to

45
00:02:32,765 --> 00:02:36,117
show one that we just proof of concept from one prompt.

46
00:02:36,395 --> 00:02:38,665
We're going to make a minor change to it as well,

47
00:02:38,837 --> 00:02:43,474
and then potentially see if we can use some prompts that I've pre-created to

48
00:02:43,475 --> 00:02:45,574
see if we can make more automations.

49
00:02:46,535 --> 00:02:49,173
So, I designed this design. Big prompt,

50
00:02:49,642 --> 00:02:54,413
it's, um, quite long and it describes everything we want to do,

51
00:02:54,414 --> 00:02:57,052
like showing the categories, showing the tools,

52
00:02:57,425 --> 00:03:01,408
all that sort of stuff. And it's all in this one little document and

53
00:03:01,409 --> 00:03:04,132
I was able to put it into Claude code.

54
00:03:04,133 --> 00:03:06,477
And if I've got Claude code down below me,

55
00:03:06,776 --> 00:03:09,559
it's just here. I was able to put it into this document.

56
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,968
I think it was, uh, and here.

57
00:03:11,969 --> 00:03:16,867
and And what we did was we generated a little

58
00:03:16,868 --> 00:03:20,663
application and that application is sitting right here.

59
00:03:20,855 --> 00:03:26,122
This is all programming language and it was all created essentially

60
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:29,598
in one shot and then I did a bit of a modification over the

61
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,996
top of it. And what it produced is this little,

62
00:03:33,997 --> 00:03:36,357
uhm, thing here. We'll just click on it.

63
00:03:36,358 --> 00:03:38,744
You and if we hit play,

64
00:03:39,089 --> 00:03:41,838
what we'll see is the animation come to life.

65
00:03:41,839 --> 00:03:46,143
Now it's just an app. It's just a program where shift something in place,

66
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,852
color it, maybe expand it, whatever.

67
00:03:49,004 --> 00:03:52,260
But this is all done in a new video programming,

68
00:03:52,261 --> 00:03:56,834
uh, language that looks like a regular timeline

69
00:03:56,835 --> 00:04:00,281
editor for videos because it's meant to work that way.

70
00:04:00,444 --> 00:04:02,575
Bye but it runs the program under the hood.

71
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:05,075
So I'll hit play and we should see this,

72
00:04:05,076 --> 00:04:09,316
uh, same video concepts that we were just looking at,

73
00:04:09,461 --> 00:04:14,135
but now they're animated. They're using whatever colors that we want.

74
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:18,613
Now I made a minor modification so that the top three of them would

75
00:04:18,651 --> 00:04:21,918
actually change color and we see that right now.

76
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,715
And what I'd like to do now is maybe make one more change.

77
00:04:24,716 --> 00:04:27,412
More modification to that particular,

78
00:04:27,413 --> 00:04:30,323
uh, video. So I think the,

79
00:04:30,324 --> 00:04:33,713
uh, changes I want to do is I want to make this green,

80
00:04:33,714 --> 00:04:36,331
uh, this blue, this yellow,

81
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:40,846
yellow, the way it is. And I probably want to narrow everything.

82
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:43,959
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to come over to,

83
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:48,779
uh, my Claude system where we kind of talk to these apps.

84
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,929
And I'm just going to make a prompt here.

85
00:04:52,761 --> 00:04:54,765
So the essential prompt I said was,

86
00:04:54,766 --> 00:04:56,962
can you alter the first three items?

87
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,734
So that one is green, two is blue, three is yellow,

88
00:04:59,735 --> 00:05:02,506
and that they come in one at a time. And can we make it

89
00:05:02,517 --> 00:05:06,184
narrow? So it just fits on a mobile phone.

90
00:05:06,387 --> 00:05:09,809
And what this is going to do under the hood is it's going to

91
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,843
read this information and it's stuck going to start writing.

92
00:05:12,844 --> 00:05:14,927
code into here.

93
00:05:14,928 --> 00:05:19,007
So this whole program is going to change one way or another.

94
00:05:19,846 --> 00:05:22,177
So what we can see here is we've got,

95
00:05:22,178 --> 00:05:27,089
ah, first place, second place, third place colours are being defined and they're using

96
00:05:27,299 --> 00:05:32,535
colour codes. And we've also got some timing and size

97
00:05:32,536 --> 00:05:35,853
sort of stuff going on, positioning going on here.

98
00:05:35,854 --> 00:05:40,393
Sorry. A mathematical calculations for how the animation is going

99
00:05:40,394 --> 00:05:45,644
to move. Here we've got information

100
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:48,384
around the flashing, the intensity of the flash,

101
00:05:48,385 --> 00:05:51,933
the colours, the background colours are being dealt with here.

102
00:05:52,555 --> 00:05:57,138
And then ultimately it just gives us a summary of everything that you

103
00:05:57,139 --> 00:06:00,971
did, uh, right there. So if I hit play on the,

104
00:06:00,972 --> 00:06:04,971
It's got the top 10 AI tools of 2025,

105
00:06:04,972 --> 00:06:09,380
and the first 10 items are coming in as per what they originally did.

106
00:06:09,567 --> 00:06:12,422
By the way, a lot of this can actually be changed.

107
00:06:12,423 --> 00:06:15,018
We can do whatever we like here, but I'm going to leave it as

108
00:06:15,019 --> 00:06:19,176
red as it comes through. And then the last three are going to come

109
00:06:19,177 --> 00:06:21,652
in as per what we requested it to do.

110
00:06:21,913 --> 00:06:25,035
Now if something didn't work, we can see that because I did,

111
00:06:25,036 --> 00:06:27,114
I did want it to be a narrower image,

112
00:06:27,115 --> 00:06:30,248
but I can go in and refat to that and should be able to

113
00:06:30,249 --> 00:06:32,621
solve it on the next run. But instead,

114
00:06:32,622 --> 00:06:37,189
what we'll do is we will pop in over to the documentation.

115
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:41,433
I'll say, I might just have a look at the pre-prompt I did on

116
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:44,295
this one. And in fact,

117
00:06:44,296 --> 00:06:46,425
all I've got to do is say, Ken.

118
00:06:48,905 --> 00:06:53,718
Sorry. I'm just going to say, can you create the requirements for 002?

119
00:06:53,719 --> 00:06:56,069
So this was all done a week ago.

120
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:58,423
I don't even remember what it's all about,

121
00:06:58,424 --> 00:07:02,712
but we can see that this is some sort of GitHub profile animation.

122
00:07:02,962 --> 00:07:05,132
It's building this long requirements.

123
00:07:05,371 --> 00:07:08,682
And this is the sort of stuff you would do as a one-shot prompt

124
00:07:08,687 --> 00:07:10,943
for building a little micro-application.

125
00:07:11,193 --> 00:07:13,845
But a lot of the designs and the ideas, uh,

126
00:07:13,846 --> 00:07:16,029
uh, including animations.

127
00:07:16,427 --> 00:07:18,684
So we're just going to copy that information,

128
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,061
head down to Claude Code,

129
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:26,186
and what we'll do. So I'm just asking it to integrate the guidelines

130
00:07:26,187 --> 00:07:29,858
that I'm about to paste in. They're being pasted in right now.

131
00:07:30,063 --> 00:07:32,843
And we want it to go into this folder just here.

132
00:07:33,273 --> 00:07:37,227
So what we're doing is taking the information that,

133
00:07:37,109 --> 00:07:41,528
that was in a single requirements document the way it would be for a

134
00:07:41,721 --> 00:07:46,481
micro application. And we're putting it into a folder that's been

135
00:07:46,482 --> 00:07:49,888
pre-designed for a video animation.

136
00:07:49,889 --> 00:07:54,045
So concept like assets and data and overview are ready to go.

137
00:07:54,238 --> 00:07:58,924
And all of this is going to be expanded with new information as it

138
00:07:58,925 --> 00:08:01,291
starts working through this requirements.

139
00:08:01,292 --> 00:08:04,692
So at the moment it's building the shot list,

140
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:08,957
which is really kind of like the frames in an animation are coming through

141
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:13,725
right here. Then what it plans to do is start

142
00:08:13,998 --> 00:08:17,467
reading or creating a GitHub profile JSON.

143
00:08:17,815 --> 00:08:22,492
So essentially a JSON document is a machine readable data

144
00:08:22,493 --> 00:08:24,651
format. It's going to go off to,

145
00:08:24,652 --> 00:08:29,555
uh, one of them. My GitHub user names and start extracting information and

146
00:08:29,556 --> 00:08:32,951
loading it into here. And this is going to give really rich data that

147
00:08:32,952 --> 00:08:37,312
can be used in the animation. And so we can see it here.

148
00:08:37,313 --> 00:08:39,332
We've got Clueless I.O. Uh,

149
00:08:39,343 --> 00:08:42,611
David Crewas building beautiful code and digital blah,

150
00:08:42,612 --> 00:08:46,213
blah, blah. So there's a whole lot of information coming through here.

151
00:08:46,472 --> 00:08:49,862
And then lastly, it's going to build the specific application,

152
00:08:49,935 --> 00:08:53,391
which is kind of like the requirements for the video animation that we're doing.

153
00:08:54,669 --> 00:08:57,778
So now we've got an overview,

154
00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:00,912
a shot list. We've got our data files,

155
00:09:00,913 --> 00:09:05,092
specifications, information around how the animation works.

156
00:09:05,093 --> 00:09:07,832
We've even got some color coding coming in.

157
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:12,710
If we jump in over here, we should now have a complex document.

158
00:09:12,933 --> 00:09:16,847
So I think, All we need to do now. So I've just asked it

159
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:19,645
to create a remotion animation.

160
00:09:19,646 --> 00:09:22,076
Umm, I said in React.

161
00:09:22,077 --> 00:09:24,280
It says reaction, but hopefully it figures that out.

162
00:09:24,489 --> 00:09:27,546
And the name of the root control should follow React,

163
00:09:27,547 --> 00:09:30,720
uhm, naming component conventions.

164
00:09:30,886 --> 00:09:35,503
But I do want it to actually use this numbering system 002,

165
00:09:35,504 --> 00:09:39,450
because I figure if I'm creating many- Good night. Animations that they should all

166
00:09:39,451 --> 00:09:43,821
just be sequential in the folder. So now it's going to start building a

167
00:09:43,822 --> 00:09:46,663
bunch of React concepts.

168
00:09:46,664 --> 00:09:50,230
We've got the title scene, the profile header, pinned repositories.

169
00:09:50,377 --> 00:09:53,141
Let's actually go have a look at what this could be based on.

170
00:09:53,832 --> 00:09:58,636
So this is just a set of repositories under one of my user

171
00:09:58,637 --> 00:10:00,672
names. There's 88 in here.

172
00:10:00,673 --> 00:10:04,511
Umm, I don't- know what it does from a visualization.

173
00:10:04,512 --> 00:10:07,636
We've got a visualization. Hasn't been a lot of code this year.

174
00:10:07,878 --> 00:10:12,648
But umm, all of this sort of information is what we want to see

175
00:10:12,857 --> 00:10:17,540
coming through in the animation. So we're seeing a whole

176
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:22,510
lot of data. So this- this is the GitHub profile JSON document.

177
00:10:23,754 --> 00:10:26,405
We've got pinned repositories. positive treatment. 7 8 attributes.

178
00:10:26,406 --> 00:10:30,057
We've got contribution graph,

179
00:10:30,058 --> 00:10:34,082
I guess, is coming through here. We've got contribution levels.

180
00:10:36,085 --> 00:10:40,617
And finally finished with a bunch of useful

181
00:10:40,618 --> 00:10:44,072
information, I hope. So let's just jump on.

182
00:10:48,037 --> 00:10:50,608
So it's just finished. Finished here.

183
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:53,412
And what have we got? Tweet. Tweet,

184
00:10:53,413 --> 00:10:56,194
type on expanding component.

185
00:10:56,482 --> 00:10:59,729
So the main idea is a tweet card.

186
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:04,095
Uh, 480 frames, 16 seconds at 30 frames per second.

187
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:06,798
Comprehensive zod validation.

188
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:11,270
So all the type safety is in place in the GitHub profile.

189
00:11:11,452 --> 00:11:13,803
We've got the title scene, the profile header.

190
00:11:13,804 --> 00:11:16,427
List of pinned repositories.

191
00:11:16,605 --> 00:11:18,728
So this looks like it's the timing,

192
00:11:18,729 --> 00:11:23,827
so that must be about, uh, four seconds to whatever

193
00:11:24,004 --> 00:11:27,924
that is to attempt. So that must be about four to ten seconds going

194
00:11:27,925 --> 00:11:30,320
on there. Then we've got,

195
00:11:33,173 --> 00:11:37,872
The contribution graph and the call to action I think if we go and

196
00:11:37,873 --> 00:11:42,553
find it, it's just here. Looks like we've got information that we can change.

197
00:11:42,554 --> 00:11:46,176
Here's Clueless.io. We've got a bug already.

198
00:11:46,798 --> 00:11:51,077
So all we do is we take all that information and we come in

199
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:55,043
over here and we just paste it. We don't even need to state that

200
00:11:55,044 --> 00:11:57,509
it is a bug that should fix it on its own.

201
00:11:58,825 --> 00:12:01,931
So it's figured out what the particular issue is.

202
00:12:01,932 --> 00:12:06,441
It's going to be. And if we just hit play again

203
00:12:06,442 --> 00:12:11,452
over here, let's see what happens. So exploring GitHub profile for Clueless.io.

204
00:12:11,453 --> 00:12:16,212
Uh, then we've got information about the pinned repositories

205
00:12:16,213 --> 00:12:18,342
coming in and see they're all being typed ahead.

206
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:20,719
Then we've got the contribution graph.

207
00:12:20,843 --> 00:12:24,419
This is, uh, a bit fake. It's not realistic at the moment,

208
00:12:24,553 --> 00:12:27,615
but it built all of the, That, based off,

209
00:12:27,616 --> 00:12:29,940
uh,

210
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:33,731
these pinned repositories, which are all about five or six years old,

211
00:12:34,134 --> 00:12:38,518
but it's all coming through quite cleanly as an animation.

212
00:12:38,687 --> 00:12:41,438
And one of the things that you can, and one of the things you

213
00:12:41,439 --> 00:12:44,244
can do here is go and click on this little render button,

214
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:46,908
and we can do a render video,

215
00:12:46,909 --> 00:12:50,064
and this will turn it into an MP4 down on the,

216
00:12:50,065 --> 00:12:52,298
Hard drive, it can then be included into,

217
00:12:52,299 --> 00:12:55,457
uh, however you want to use it in your video production.

218
00:12:56,239 --> 00:13:00,788
So, now we're just going to recreate requirement number

219
00:13:00,835 --> 00:13:05,630
three, which happens to be about animated Twitter post example

220
00:13:05,631 --> 00:13:10,284
this time. So we're just building another documentation system

221
00:13:10,285 --> 00:13:14,986
with the very simple, create a remotion

222
00:13:14,987 --> 00:13:18,400
documentation 003 using the following requirements,

223
00:13:18,599 --> 00:13:22,370
put it into .03 folder,

224
00:13:22,371 --> 00:13:25,670
it's updating all the different things that we had before.

225
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:30,361
We've got the overview, the shot list, we've got the Twitter post JSON data,

226
00:13:30,362 --> 00:13:32,900
so any of the machine readable data will go into there.

227
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:37,207
Here's our specifications or overview coming into place at the moment.

228
00:13:38,057 --> 00:13:43,085
So, So I've pre-set up the next thing to create the components.

229
00:13:43,716 --> 00:13:47,136
It's the same prompt as before, just with the numbers being changed.

230
00:13:47,384 --> 00:13:50,768
But while it's still writing this, we might just go and change a little

231
00:13:50,769 --> 00:13:53,949
bit of data here, and we'll just say Appie,

232
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,935
and we'll just say Appie Dave,

233
00:13:56,979 --> 00:14:00,603
like that, and we might just change both of those.

234
00:14:00,604 --> 00:14:03,498
Is it anywhere else? And we'll just call that, Dave as well,

235
00:14:03,499 --> 00:14:06,553
and we'll hit Save. So with that in place,

236
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:12,299
and a summary of everything happening, let's go and create the controls.

237
00:14:12,662 --> 00:14:17,540
So what should be happening right now is it's reading through this documentation

238
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:21,863
that it's gone and created, and we're going to get another control here.

239
00:14:21,981 --> 00:14:25,878
Now I was hoping earlier that it would be pre-fixed with a number,

240
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:28,916
umm. Maybe that's, uh,

241
00:14:28,927 --> 00:14:31,177
and a little bit of a confirmation that,

242
00:14:31,178 --> 00:14:35,905
uh, starting a component with 002 is a no-no,

243
00:14:35,906 --> 00:14:38,339
so that's the reason it didn't happen.

244
00:14:38,792 --> 00:14:40,983
But here it is going through.

245
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:47,383
But here it is going through and creating the component

246
00:14:47,384 --> 00:14:50,379
tree for this new animation.

247
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:53,135
Now, it's written everything.

248
00:14:53,136 --> 00:14:57,421
One of the things I noticed, one of the things I noticed,

249
00:14:57,422 --> 00:15:00,761
which was a mistake on my part,

250
00:15:01,203 --> 00:15:05,790
is that I actually pointed folders at the wrong naming

251
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:09,357
convention, so they're a little bit reversed. So this is the one we've just

252
00:15:09,358 --> 00:15:12,545
created. It's the animated tweet coming through.

253
00:15:12,546 --> 00:15:14,976
Uh, again, maybe a little bit- fast,

254
00:15:14,977 --> 00:15:18,458
you- from a video point of view, you can actually slow it down here.

255
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:23,489
But, um, what really needs to happen is that this one here should

256
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:26,092
be the tweet type on expanding card,

257
00:15:26,324 --> 00:15:30,027
while this one up here should be the GitHub profile showcase,

258
00:15:30,152 --> 00:15:32,557
but it's only a title change that's out of,

259
00:15:32,558 --> 00:15:35,505
uh, out of whack there,

260
00:15:35,506 --> 00:15:38,832
so we'll let this run over here, we'll just speed it up- a little

261
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:41,441
bit so we can see it coming through quickly.

262
00:15:41,725 --> 00:15:44,808
One of the other things I did was I made it a little bit

263
00:15:44,809 --> 00:15:48,566
bigger just by changing this, so it was sitting on fit when we were

264
00:15:48,567 --> 00:15:51,740
looking at it earlier, we'll just bring it back up to a hundred percent,

265
00:15:51,907 --> 00:15:54,661
and we can see the information a lot cleaner.

266
00:15:56,459 --> 00:16:01,624
And the same thing when we do our little tabular table

267
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:06,190
now. Wha what's happened here, let's just make this a bit fifty percent as

268
00:16:06,191 --> 00:16:08,803
well because we were losing a heading.

269
00:16:09,602 --> 00:16:12,438
And we've just made it fifty percent as well because we were losing the

270
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:17,172
heading here. And I've just made it fifty percent on this one

271
00:16:17,173 --> 00:16:20,968
so that we can see the little table and the headlines at the top.

272
00:16:21,479 --> 00:16:25,089
And here come in step one,

273
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:27,242
two and three, and here come in the- winners, one,

274
00:16:27,243 --> 00:16:30,457
two and three. So we go through the process one more time and this

275
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:34,211
last one we're doing is creating the requirements for number four.

276
00:16:35,841 --> 00:16:40,575
And it had actually picked the wrong requirements when it

277
00:16:40,576 --> 00:16:44,664
just drew what it did above. So I've just told it to work on

278
00:16:44,665 --> 00:16:48,210
number four, which is a YouTube channel outro.

279
00:16:48,464 --> 00:16:50,704
So in the past I've had channel out.

280
00:16:50,705 --> 00:16:54,063
Shows where you see, uh, the different videos I've got,

281
00:16:54,064 --> 00:16:56,685
the like and subscribe button, the comments,

282
00:16:56,686 --> 00:16:59,745
the number of subscribers and suggested videos.

283
00:16:59,937 --> 00:17:03,861
And I think it would be nice to have that style of animation being

284
00:17:04,085 --> 00:17:08,051
automatically created. I don't think it'll get it with the graphics at the moment,

285
00:17:08,052 --> 00:17:12,060
but we'll see what it does produce. So the same steps,

286
00:17:12,081 --> 00:17:16,847
again, we just take our requirements and And we get it merged

287
00:17:16,848 --> 00:17:21,294
into this structure of shot list, data and specification.

288
00:17:21,421 --> 00:17:24,418
It's all going to appear in this folder very soon.

289
00:17:24,566 --> 00:17:27,030
We can close a lot of them as we go.

290
00:17:28,948 --> 00:17:32,190
The overview is coming into place at the moment.

291
00:17:33,479 --> 00:17:36,502
We can see that it's picked up. Happy Dave with,

292
00:17:36,503 --> 00:17:38,832
uh, 2,400 subscribers.

293
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:40,948
165 videos.

294
00:17:40,949 --> 00:17:43,273
So these are the sorts of metrics that, uh,

295
00:17:43,283 --> 00:17:45,874
we'd like to include in any sort of outro.

296
00:17:45,992 --> 00:17:48,609
One of the things that you can do with remotion is you can make

297
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:51,397
a lot of these, uh, variables that can be changeable.

298
00:17:51,579 --> 00:17:55,513
You saw that earlier changing the colors, but you can also change these numbers

299
00:17:55,514 --> 00:17:58,365
as you go. Uh, which is great.

300
00:17:58,366 --> 00:18:00,822
We've got our data coming through here.

301
00:18:01,857 --> 00:18:06,395
So, verified. We've got the names Aipowered app development

302
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:11,481
tutorials. And our standard prompt can kick in next.

303
00:18:11,775 --> 00:18:16,506
It'll be, please implement this remotion animation in React and name the root

304
00:18:16,507 --> 00:18:18,966
control using React component convention,

305
00:18:19,143 --> 00:18:23,655
but using the name 004. So this is actually all wrong because we've

306
00:18:23,656 --> 00:18:26,323
already debunked it that we can start with numbers.

307
00:18:26,467 --> 00:18:29,514
I've still- So, Got the, uh, typo from earlier as well,

308
00:18:29,515 --> 00:18:33,453
reaction. So I've just been pressing the upper arrow button to go back to

309
00:18:33,454 --> 00:18:35,464
previous prompts and changing some things.

310
00:18:35,654 --> 00:18:39,115
I haven't really read it through because I'm just doing this video quickly at

311
00:18:39,116 --> 00:18:43,300
the moment. So now it's going to start creating the controls.

312
00:18:43,533 --> 00:18:48,343
I will just, um, come back over to remotion if we can find

313
00:18:48,344 --> 00:18:50,668
it. It should be over here somewhere. And,

314
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:53,268
uh- out. One of the things that you can notice, so if we go

315
00:18:53,269 --> 00:18:58,156
to the hello world, what I was talking about earlier with properties is

316
00:18:58,232 --> 00:19:02,939
this sort of stuff. So, hello from Appie Dave can

317
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:07,421
go in here, and then we can play it around with colours like this

318
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:11,442
here. So, all these sorts of properties can be configured.

319
00:19:11,443 --> 00:19:15,520
I haven't done it yet. Um, it kind of happens automatically but- you can

320
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:18,212
change what it does as it goes.

321
00:19:18,213 --> 00:19:22,567
Oh, and this little window over here that's just changing.

322
00:19:22,568 --> 00:19:25,569
This is the actual React application running,

323
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:27,616
so if I just, uh, kill that,

324
00:19:27,617 --> 00:19:30,506
we'll just clear it, and we'll do a node run dev,

325
00:19:30,526 --> 00:19:32,819
let it run. It starts reloading,

326
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:36,892
and you'll see here it's about to reload the page for us in this

327
00:19:36,893 --> 00:19:39,152
location.

328
00:19:39,153 --> 00:19:41,637
Okay, we've got everything created.

329
00:19:41,646 --> 00:19:44,015
Let's go and check it out.

330
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:48,141
And where is it? YouTube channel outro.

331
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:52,645
So, happy Dave. We've got some sort of graphic going on behind the scenes.

332
00:19:52,646 --> 00:19:57,155
We've got subscribers. Terrible color-coding going on

333
00:19:57,156 --> 00:19:59,351
here. And is that it? Let's, uh,

334
00:19:59,362 --> 00:20:01,458
let's hit play. So,

335
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:06,814
here it's coming through. We've got different videos available.

336
00:20:06,815 --> 00:20:08,957
Uh,

337
00:20:08,968 --> 00:20:11,278
like and subscribe. Sounds good.

338
00:20:11,509 --> 00:20:13,862
This is using a whole lot of,

339
00:20:13,863 --> 00:20:16,144
um, stop photography,

340
00:20:16,145 --> 00:20:18,315
which isn't necessarily what I want.

341
00:20:18,621 --> 00:20:21,386
Can we get rid of this? We can.

342
00:20:21,446 --> 00:20:23,804
Next up for you. Ah, perfect.

343
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:26,326
Okay, so it could use a lot of,

344
00:20:26,327 --> 00:20:30,372
um, So, we'll be tweaking. But this is where I can talk about the

345
00:20:30,373 --> 00:20:33,544
next three videos coming up. Please like and subscribe.

346
00:20:33,545 --> 00:20:36,199
Umm, ring the notification bell.

347
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,397
Uh, here's one of the next videos that we're working on.

348
00:20:39,398 --> 00:20:43,000
And here's some timestamps. A little bit of a tweak going on.

349
00:20:43,514 --> 00:20:48,588
Okay. This is cool. I, I can see how I could create these animations

350
00:20:48,589 --> 00:20:51,205
dynamically. And then just talk to whatever.

351
00:20:51,024 --> 00:20:53,599
whatever. I see. So here are the latest videos.

352
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,126
Uh, please like and subscribe.

353
00:20:56,127 --> 00:20:58,228
Uh, it'll help us out immediately.

354
00:20:58,395 --> 00:21:01,534
It'd be, I don't know why it didn't do the comment section.

355
00:21:01,828 --> 00:21:05,276
But here we've got the chapter links going on.

356
00:21:05,506 --> 00:21:09,999
And join the conversation. There's where we can do the commenting sort of concepts.

357
00:21:11,178 --> 00:21:15,285
So there we have it. That's just a quick overview video of me just.

358
00:21:15,286 --> 00:21:18,260
please. Playing around with the technology hasn't been designed,

359
00:21:18,261 --> 00:21:21,608
uh, to be published on YouTube.

360
00:21:21,609 --> 00:21:24,395
This video, buddy,

361
00:21:24,396 --> 00:21:26,151
will be it. This is really a raw sort of, uh, video that I've

362
00:21:26,152 --> 00:21:27,513
put together in bloom. But, uh, that's it. I'm happy Dave. Please like and

363
00:21:27,514 --> 00:21:29,218
subscribe. I'll see you in the next video.
