Now, one of the future agents is the mock data system, and this is what it's for.
It's for testing prompts that require data.
We don't want to go into the database and change anything.
We want to auto-generate realistic data if we can do it, and quickly go through a workflow.
So Angela here is going to create a template.
This is the idea.
We've got some data source, so maybe it's a single incident, or it could be a list of
incidents.
Then what we're going to do is understand the schema of the data coming through so that
we can then generate the mock data along the way.
That way we can instantly test the template without going into the application, and when
we're finished, just publish it.
