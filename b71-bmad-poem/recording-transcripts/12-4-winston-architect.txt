So we come back to our conversation the next thing it gave us was a mermaid
diagram so we've got a high level design document so we'll do the same thing and
we'll just visualize that and we can see that the user environment is that it's
planned to work within a coding agent like Claude could be used in is that
it's planned to be used in a coding agent like Claude it could be used in
the IDE or the terminal it's planned to be used in Claude code but we could use
it with Codex or I have got a plan to be working within Claude code but maybe it
can be used in Codex or Gemini as well it's an IDE terminal based system
anyway so we've got the different agents that we've planned the prompt engineer
system agent and integration agent later on less definition on this we got the
mock data agent we've got some workflows defined we've got some skills
and it's the skills that currently would limit it to Claude code because that's
a because that's an anthropic concept and then we've got the knowledge base so
anything I'm learning about prompt engineering gets stored into best
practices then we've got the runtime this is all going to run out of the
home app got the astro handlebars custom helpers and the rest API's
