So, just answering four of the questions and we're letting it use the latest version of
Astro.
When it works with helpers, they should eager load because the performance won't matter
because this is a startup sequence for the Astro server.
Now, I don't know how the providers are going to work, but I'm assuming it's going to be
an interface specification, so I've just put that in place.
And the same thing with the schema, I don't know much about whether I want to use Zod
or some sort of type checking, but for now it's just going to be a simple JSON document,
so we'll let that go through.
