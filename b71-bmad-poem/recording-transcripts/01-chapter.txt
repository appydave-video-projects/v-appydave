BMAD method is this agent orchestration system that was created to allow you to build software
effectively and efficiently using context engineering.

It employs really powerful engineering principles and agents that run within AI
coding environments like Claude Code, Codex or Cursor.

For the last six months I've been using BMAD to build software but today what we're going
to do is use it to build another orchestration framework with similarities to BMAD method.
We're going to call it POM which is the Prompt Orchestration and Engineering method but essentially
what it is is a prompt engineering operating system.

Now before we switch over to building this system, let's turn over to Future Dave to see how it works.
