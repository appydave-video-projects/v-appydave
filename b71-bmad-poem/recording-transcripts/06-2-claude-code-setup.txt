So let's head over to the terminal and we'll set up Claude. I'm going to run the dangerously skip permissions.
Now the first thing we want to do is an init to get the Claude ND file set up.
And we'll just put in an extra instruction letting it know that it should focus on the BMAD core and anything in the .Claude folder.
But anything related to the planning or the data files, they're not really that relevant to us.
Because that's going to be used by BMAD core, but we don't want our general instructions in Claude to need to know about it.
