So, let's set up in the terminal Claude code and we're running it with the dangerously
skipped permissions.
And the first thing we want to do is ensure that we've got a Claude MD file.
So we'll kick off the Claude.
Now I'm going to paste in a little extra context in the prompt.
Essentially what we want to do is make sure that the Claude MD has a lot of knowledge
about BMAD Core.
Now it doesn't really need to know much about the data folders.
It doesn't need to know much about the planning because we will tell BMAD Core, because we
will tell BMAD about that when we're running it, but we don't want that to influence Claude
too much in the future.
