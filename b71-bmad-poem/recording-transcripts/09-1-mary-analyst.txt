Now we've gone to the constraints and assumptions and this is an incredible
section, it's written. I've gone through it and everything is accurate. There is
only one part that could need changing and it's this part here. The MVP target
is three to four months. Well the reality is we're using the BMAD method
and we're using Claude code so everything is amplified. I hope that
this is going to be finished in the next four to five days rather than three to
four months. So with that we just press one and keep going.
