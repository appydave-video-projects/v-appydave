After that we've got eight other stories so they're all following the same process.
We've got the user story coming in here, we've got the acceptance criteria each time.
And it finishes up with this rationale as to why it did the eight and why they're in the particular order they're in.
Now one of the other things it does is it gives semantic coding to each of the requirements that it's listed above.
And the naming convention it goes with is generally a FR for functional requirement.
There'll be some sort of category and a number.
The one it's picked out for us is there's a couple of use cases.
There's examples of how it would work with two of the agents.
We've got the prompt engineer, we've got the system infrastructure.
But we've also got some backend stuff, so we've got the runtime infrastructure.
It'll then finish it off and tell us what it's not going to include.
And then lastly, what do we want to do next?
So I think what we'll do is we'll just do number one and we'll just proceed and see what happens.
