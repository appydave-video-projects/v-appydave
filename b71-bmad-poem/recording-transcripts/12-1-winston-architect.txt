So with that we can move on to working with the architect and the best way to
get started is to run a Claude system. And to get started we start a fresh
system. I'm doing Claude this time. So we start a new terminal with Claude.
So we'll just start a new session with Claude and we'll go straight into the
architect. So Winston has come up. We've got a list of commands that we can work
with and what we'll do is we'll start putting in the create full stack
architecture using the PRD. Now we are actually going to have to put in a
little bit different prompt because we don't specifically have a full stack
application. So this is what we'll go with. So the little change is be aware
that it's not a full stack, that you can find what you're looking for in the PRD
and that essentially what we're building is a BMAD style framework with a
separate sub module or application that we'll communicate with and with that
we'll just press enter.
