So from the beginning we'll embrace the idea of fake or simulated workflows,
meaning that we don't have to have handlebars templates in place to get a
templating system working. We don't have to have clawed skills in place to do
some things that the large language model could infer, but later on when we
have them it'll just be more... but later on when we have them everything will be
a lot more predictable.
