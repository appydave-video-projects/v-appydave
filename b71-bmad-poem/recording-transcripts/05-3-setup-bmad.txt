So let's have a quick look at what's been installed so firstly we have the
BMAD Core has been installed we've got agents that are all in place we've got
templates workflows tasks etc from there we also have the Claude code folder and
this is where we can see a mapping of the agents and tasks from BMAD Core
through to Claude code. Now the rest of the information was already there we've
got the data for the storyline application and the support signal
application so we've got prompts data schemas etc and we've got our dots
folder and this is where BMAD method will write into now it won't write into
the planning but it will read from the planning that we've already set up. Now
at this point I would normally go into Claude and do a Claude init but I do
have a simple Claude file set up
