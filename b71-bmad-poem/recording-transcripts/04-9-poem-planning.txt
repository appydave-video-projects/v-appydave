So we're just about to get ready with BMAD and for it to work effectively we need to give it some sort of context documents.
We can do it with the business analyst agent in BMAD, but I've already done most of the hard work here in this file structure.
And apart from the rules and the planning that we've got, I've also got a couple of folders related just to data.
So we've got all the schemas, the prompts and the data from the storyline application.
And we get the same sort of information from the support signal application.
