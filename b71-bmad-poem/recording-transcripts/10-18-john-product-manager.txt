So for epics, it's come up with seven and it's really interesting reading through this.
This is pretty much exactly how I need it to work.
Now seven epics is fairly big and things can go adrift fairly easy with this number of
epics, but it still feels like it's the right size for what we're trying to do.
It thinks about alternative structures and gives rationale for why it might not do it
and in each case it's actually correct.
We wouldn't want to mix the creation of the prompt engineer with the mock data and it
makes total sense to combine astro and handlebars, especially when we're doing the API.
The only area I've got a little bit of concern with is this mock data area, so it makes it
think that we're going to have this mock system, we'll test it with the prompts, it'll produce
output and this is great and I want to have this.
This is great and I want to have it, but there's a much more important workflow which we could
mix in with this.
So I've just given it an idea of a realistic workflow that I'm going to do later today
using YouTube automation and so it'll still do the same things as the mock data, but it
will be for a real workflow.
So earlier in the week, so I've just finished a video on B-mad, it's a two hour video and
part of the launching...
