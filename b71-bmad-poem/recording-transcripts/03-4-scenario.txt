So using this screen as basis, let's talk about what a prompt orchestration framework could have.
So we can have various prompts of course, and we might want to be able to copy them to the clipboard.
We want to see them as a template with interpolation values in the middle,
and those interpolation values would come from different data sources.
Here we've got concepts like incidents, and we should be able to have various fields,
and if they're green it means that we're actually using the field from the data source.
If they're blue in this case, we're not using them, but they are available.
We should be able to see how it looks if it was all interpolated,
and also be able to press copy on that and test it in any large language model that we like.
And we should be able to quickly iterate and test concepts.
So if we just paste in this idea of reporter name, caring for participant at location,
we should be able to see that information interpolated and run automatically in the testing harness.
And that's exactly what this application is doing.
So we've got some output format going on here, and if we were to press the complete step,
what would happen is it would generate a bunch of questions based on the prompt.
