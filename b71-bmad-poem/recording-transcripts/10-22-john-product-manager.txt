So while I was doing that workflow I was also documenting what was going on and I
was able to develop a preliminary agent called Page and that was able to
deliver 27 prompt engineering tips or principles that I developed during that
process which are going to be really useful in Pome. Plus we got this primary
document which just documented the complete workflow. So I've just dropped
that into the planning and exploration folder. It's got a bunch of template
sections. We've got workflow data being collected along the way and then we'll
just select all the data put it into the clipboard and then we'll just select all
the data put it into the clipboard and we can go back to our other conversation
paste it in and that's what we'll use for context for this particular question.
