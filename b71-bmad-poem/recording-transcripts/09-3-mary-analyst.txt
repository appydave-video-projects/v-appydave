So we've just hit the end of the business analyst phase and you can see
that there's a whole lot of planning documents being referenced. If you want
to go into detail on any of them they are in the repository also in my skill
community I do a video on each of these. Now it's also referencing second brains
on my system we've got an SDK here from Anthropic otherwise we've got other
documentation otherwise it's other documentation that I've compiled on both
BMAD and ClaudeSkills. It's interesting it understands the three stakeholders so
it's got me as the project lead then it's got the primary user which is Angela who
does a lot of the prompt engineering on support signal and lastly we've got Vos
who does a lot of movie making and storytelling and he'll be using this
for creative projects and lastly we've got references to external libraries and
systems that we need to be able to call on during the build phase. So that's a
review done what we can do next is move on to the project brief and that'll and
what we can do now is move on to the project manager and creating the PRD.
