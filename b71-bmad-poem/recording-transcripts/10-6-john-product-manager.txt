So the main problems in the functional requirements at the moment is the
description of the agents and the technical plumbing. So what we want to do
is make sure that there's conceptual groupings along the ideas that we have
four different agents. We have the prompt engineer, then we have the system
integrator which will talk to a backend service written in Astro and handlebars
and then on top of that we'll have the integration agent that can talk to any
external system and lastly we'll have a testing framework basically the idea of
sending mock data through our prompts to produce outputs.
