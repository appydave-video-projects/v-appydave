So coming back to the be mad conversation we had seven epics one of
them needed to be revised it's the YouTube workflow and what I've done in
the meantime is gone off and released a video now the video is 12 now the video
is two hours long and what that allowed me to do was test a big workflow where
at the end of it I ended up with concepts like this YouTube description
and we've got many different chapters in the video all worked out using prompt
engineering and so when we go back to answering the questions and it currently
has three different questions it's asking but what we need to do is have
something in there that really talks about that workflow
