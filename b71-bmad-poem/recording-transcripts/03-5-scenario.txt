Now, as powerful as the AI prompt management system is, the problem with it is that it
was added into an application for which it's not a primary use case of the application.
This application is specifically about listing incidents, it's about creating new incidents.
And while having this prompt engineering framework built in and being able to dynamically change
on the fly has been useful, it really slows down the development of this system.
And so I thought when new capabilities were needed, why don't we go and create that using
a brand new system, and this is where the idea for Pome came about.
