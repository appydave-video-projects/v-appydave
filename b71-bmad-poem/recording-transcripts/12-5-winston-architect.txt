At this point, we'll come back to B-MAD, we can see there's some architectural patterns,
a bit hard to see, but I'm going to kick this off to keep going.
And we'll come back to our little diagram, and down the bottom we've got this list of
architectural patterns.
So the first one is the document framework pattern, then we've got our runtime system
using Astro, after that it's all going to be agent guided workflows, so the workflows
will probably be done in YAML files or some other sort of machine readable structure.
Then we're going to use skills, so a lot of the stuff to go get context or talk to the
systems will be done with skills, and after that we've got the provider abstraction pattern,
sometimes known as the plugin pattern.
And what that will allow us to do is provide integrations to external systems in a consistent
interface, yet to be defined really, and then everything's going to be file based for story.
And one of the last and very important areas is just how is data going to be shaped, because
when we're dealing with prompt engineering, it's a lot of interpolation of values, maybe
changing the shape of them, pulling them in from different schemas, pulling them in from
different data sources, and we're going to have to figure out a schema driven approach
to that.
