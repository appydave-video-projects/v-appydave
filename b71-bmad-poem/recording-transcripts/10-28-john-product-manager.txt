Now our product requirement document is complete. We've got a folder that it's
been put into as PID, it's for the POM system and what we know about it is that
it's got seven epics, we've got 40 stories, a bunch of functional and
non-functional requirements and we can see that mostly it'll be done in six
epics and the seventh epic might be done after the application is built and the
seventh epic might be more a testing of the application framework itself. Now
next we move on to the architecture phase which is Winston.
