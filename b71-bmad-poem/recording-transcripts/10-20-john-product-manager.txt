Now the great thing is that doing this will be the total foundation for the
application because we're going to have prompt chaining, we're going to have
variables, we might be able to modify the variables with helpers, we'll be building
up a data set, this is the workflow, this would be the workflow attribute set and
if along the way I want to add new workflows or prompts into it we'll also
have the ability to extract and update the schema on the fly.
