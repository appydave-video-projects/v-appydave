Now one of the things that you might have also noticed looking at that last
screen is that the visuals in the video have suddenly started to get a little
bit better and the reason for that is that I'm actively using Pome even though
I haven't built the Pome system right now. So the two systems that were
built and so the two visuals that were built in the last half an hour this one
and the one we saw a little bit earlier right here we're all done from one shot
prompts and another one that I've got in place is this another one I've got in
place and another one that I've got in place is a branding system so this up
here has generally been the branding system I've been using in the past and
I'm in the middle of and I'm in the middle of testing out a little bit of a
change in style and these are just ideas that I'm playing around with and
the way I've done it is built a bunch of little components and as I move left and
right I can see different components how they could look but the actual two but
the two that you've just seen they're done directly from a prompt let's go
have a look at that and all of this is just one of the experiments that I'm
doing so if we come back and have a look at the prompt we used for this we can go
down to this terminal screen we can go down to this terminal screen and you can
see that it's written out the file it is a one-shot prompt if we move up all I
did was gave it a little bit of information that we had from be mad and
one thing you didn't see in the be mad prompt was I'd also asked it what the
name of the architect was so I'd forgotten and said it's Winston and so
all up it created this really beautiful summary it's a transition we know where
we're going next and this is one of the primary goals that I'm trying to deal
with with using the poem framework
