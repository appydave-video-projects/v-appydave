So we're about to install the BMAD method to get started but let's just have one more look at the data we've got available.
So firstly is the two data scenarios and I've got mappings prompts and schemas for both the storyline creative application
and for the support signal application and all of this will be fed into BMAD at some stage.
And I also have all the planning documents and so we can see from those documents that there's a lot of rich information.
If you want to see a look at each individual document in my community I have recordings of me talking about each and every document for understanding.
