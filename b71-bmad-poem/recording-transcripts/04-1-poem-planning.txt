So what I'm trying to create with POM is a prompt engineering operating system.
Now the actual name POM stands for prompt orchestration and engineering
method and as you saw from the application we just ran the idea is
that we should be able to compose a prompt, test it, refine it and then at the
end deploy it to whatever application it's used for.
