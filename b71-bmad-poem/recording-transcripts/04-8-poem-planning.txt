Now I've got data for prompts in two different systems we've got support
signal which is a healthcare system it's very structured it's rules-based it's
compliance and then we've got storyline which is an application I've built for
making movies it's a very free flow and creative sort of process and so I'm
hoping that the poem operating system will be able to deal with two totally
different scenarios and work effectively in both.
