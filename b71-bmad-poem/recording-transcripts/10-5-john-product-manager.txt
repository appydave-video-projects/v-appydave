So as we read through the functional requirements we can see that the first
thing it's considering is that we should be able to install the POM framework.
It's thinking that we need some sort of agent called the prompt engineer and it
moves on to talking about extracting data from handlebars. Now one of the
problems we can see already with this is that handlebars really can't happen
until we've done stuff around Astro. Plus it's trying to emphasize a fair bit
that handlebars is used in this system and it's really only a small part
and it's really only a small part of the system. The main thing that we need are
the agents and that when we're using the agents some of these other
capabilities like handlebars can only get introduced when certain layers of
the system are in place. And so this led me to think that I really need to
refactor this a little bit or at least have a dialogue with my original
planning documents. And this got me thinking that I needed to go back and
look at my original planning documents and have a little bit of a conversation
with them. And so in a new Claude code context what I've done is started a
planning session including all the functional requirements that we just
saw and looking at the planning documents.
