So, it's written the high level architecture, now this is a wall of text, so what we're
just going to do is copy it, and so we'll just make that a little bit more visual and
I'm just pasting it into this prompt that started with the phrase, here is the wall
of text, can you just simplify it, make it easier to see.
So we can go and click on this file and this is what it looks like, we've got the poem
technical summary, the main idea is that we're going to have the core with our agents, workflow,
skills and a second brain, it's called knowledge base, and we're also going to have the application
which will be an Astro server with handlebars engine, there'll be two communication areas
here, there'll be either the APIs both internally for templates or externally for prompts or
providers, but also plan to do a lot of visual testing of prompts within this area, and then
we've got PIME which is where you would put your own files, so this is where your own prompts,
schemas and mappings are planning to go, we can see some of that all listed here in the key services
that it will also just be a node application running on the system and this is how the
repository should work and also how we should be able to install it.
