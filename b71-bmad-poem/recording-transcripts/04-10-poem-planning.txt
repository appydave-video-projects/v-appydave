So we're getting ready to set up BMAD. There's the BMAD install method which
will run from the POM OS folder but before we do that let's just go over the
documentation one more time. So we've got all this planning information. This is
going to be the context that we're going to send to the business analyst agent in
BMAD to start building out the application. Also I've got a whole lot of
data scenarios that we can check out so if we look at it we've got information
for support signal and information for the storyline application.
