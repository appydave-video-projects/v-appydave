So now it's just analyzing whether the PRD is ready. We've got 92% completion in
its opinion. It's ready for architecture so we could move on to that soon. It's
listing an analysis of all the different categories and whether they're a pass
or something that we potentially need to go and look at. And the two that are
listed make a lot of sense not to be fully done because I don't really know
how I want the user interface in the Astro application to work. It's not
primarily the main thing of this project just yet and the integration with
providers will need to wait till we have providers to integrate with.
