Now the proposed solution is coming together here and we can see POM Core
which is very similar to BMAD Core in function. Then we have the POM app and
the idea of this from the very beginning was it was kind of like an operating
system. So Windows has Windows Explorer and Apple and the Mac has Finder and I
thought it'd be really useful if when we're creating documents in POM we'd be
able to visualize them quickly and so we'll do that with the POM app and that
will also provide a couple of other capabilities such as templates that
are pre-compiled. I was originally going to do this with
Claude skills but they get loaded up every time and that would be a bit of a
slow boot up sequence so we'll put it into the handlebars application and when
you're deploying any templates to an application you're going to have to have
a custom provider model so that again can be handled by the API endpoints
that are already available in an Astro application. After that all we want to do
is have a POM directory and this is where all the prompt engineering output
will end up.
