So in section six we're just setting up the EPIC details. Now that will have a
list of stories. They're lightweight, they're not heavy-duty stories that we
see later on and so it's going to work with EPIC 4. It would normally start
with EPIC 1 but we've just given it information so it knows let's work with
that first. So it says for EPIC 4 it's going to be the YouTube
automation workflow as a system validation concept. So the first story
within that EPIC will be how do we bring in information from an external
system. Now it then lists only two concepts. We've got the user story, we've
got the acceptance criteria and in the user story the way it starts is who's
it for, like what person is going to be affected by the change and in this case
it's the prompt engineer. The next step in a user story is what do they want to
achieve. So in this case what we want to do is bring that templating system into
Pone and the last part of a user story is why would this be of use to them and
so here we're just listing that they'd have real-world prompt templates
available to work with. Now when we go to do the development we will know that
this particular story is done once the acceptance criteria have been complete.
So it's quite lightweight but it's also really powerful in the way it's structured.
