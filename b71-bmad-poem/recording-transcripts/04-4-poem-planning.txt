Now the plan is for between three and four agents we definitely need a prompt
engineer that's the main use case. We need the system agent which is designed
to work with the Astro application and to create providers and then we have the
integration agent and this is how templates will be sent to different
applications. I also think it would be really useful if we had a data testing
agent where we could generate mock data and we can send that mock data through
the prompt templates in real-time tests.
