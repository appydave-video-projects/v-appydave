So, to make an effective change to the technical considerations, we really need to understand
what we're working with and so what POM is a foundational architecture.
It's a framework, it's not an actual application.
And as a specialized framework, similar to BMAD, we're going to be creating agents, templates,
workflows, checklists, those sorts of documents.
So BMAD will build software, POM will build prompts.
So like BMAD Core, we're going to have the POM Core which is going to have a lot of similarities.
What BMAD doesn't currently have is an application to visualize and communicate with.
That's something new that we're going to add into this framework.
And when you're using BMAD, you're either generating documents in the docs folder or
you're generating code or where generally going to be building is documents to go into
the POM folder.
