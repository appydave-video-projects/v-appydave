Now, the stack that we're building is very similar to how BMAD works.
So under the hood, we've got an AI provider like Anthropic or OpenAI.
Then you've got your assistants that you're going to build it on.
It could be Cloud Codex or Cursor.
Then we've got the framework, so we're doing something very similar to BMAD.
We're calling it POM.
And where BMAD would build apps, POM is designed to build prompts.
