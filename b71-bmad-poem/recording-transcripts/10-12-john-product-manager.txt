So one of the cross-cutting capabilities will be skills and this will allow our
agents to talk explicitly with different systems. So the prompt engineer will be
talking to the Astro application to process a template while the system
agent will be talking to the handlebars system to create a helper while the
integration agent might be talking to the storyline application to get
data or to send new prompts.
