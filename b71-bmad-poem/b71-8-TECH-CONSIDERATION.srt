1
00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:05,120
Now, as we get to the technical considerations, we learn that it's not really doing 

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,160
what I want. We'll come back and look at why it's not working. But the reason for 

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:14,550
this is that the Bmad method is designed, and particularly this agent that we're 

4
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:15,160
working with, 

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:19,880
the analyst agent is around creating applications. So you might want to create some 

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,670
sort of C sharp command line tool. Or 

7
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:28,320
you might want to create a web application using React and Convex as a database. 

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,80
And for this 

9
00:00:29,80 --> 00:00:32,920
and for these sorts of problems, Bmad is ideally suited. 

10
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:38,240
but when we look at the technical considerations, we see that it looks kind of okay. 

11
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:43,800
But on reading individual lines, you start to see that it's fairly off the mark at 

12
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,240
the moment. So let's go into what's wrong and then how we could maybe fix this.

13
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:53,560
So let's try and understand the Bmad method. So I have this second brain set up to 

14
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,880
point at version four and version six of the Bmad method, and that allows me to do 

15
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,120
some Q&A against either system.

16
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,240
And in version six we have access to something called the Bmad builder module,

17
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,400
and with it we could customize our agents, our workflows, or the modules that are 

18
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,560
used under the hood.

19
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,40
And one of the things it has is the ability to edit a workflow, which is what I believe 

20
00:01:17,40 --> 00:01:18,430
I'd like to do today.

21
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:23,150
Now, understanding custom workflows and custom agents is a whole nother video, so 

22
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,350
we'll do that in the future. 

23
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:29,430
But let's have a look at what we could do with Bmad method version four. And in this 

24
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:35,70
particular case it's the technical considerations, which is one of the workflows 

25
00:01:35,70 --> 00:01:40,560
within Bmad. For that we either need to edit or we're just going to override.

26
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,120
So let's get into the technical considerations and just see where it might have gone 

27
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:50,150
off kilter. So firstly, the fact that it can run on cloud code as the primary with 

28
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:57,150
a backup system being cursor or codex is correct. The idea that it's not a web application. 

29
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:03,240
So no web browser requirements, just API requirements is not quite correct, but also 

30
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:09,750
the fact that it's mentioned as a front end being Astro and the back end being TypeScript 

31
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:15,960
is correct kind of, but this is actually a submodule. It's a tool really, that's 

32
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:23,80
going to be used by the poem system. So the main application is not the astro concepts, 

33
00:02:23,80 --> 00:02:29,30
it's actually the poem framework. And then after that some extra tooling or a submodule 

34
00:02:29,30 --> 00:02:31,30
would be the astro application.

35
00:02:31,30 --> 00:02:35,350
Then we get into the database. And a lot of what I'm talking about here is really 

36
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:40,480
subtle, but it will screw up the system if we don't get it right. And it's the idea 

37
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,410
that in the future there's a database, well, that's not needed at all. So we can 

38
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:49,840
remove that. But all of these files being the backend sort of system isn't correct. 

39
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,740
So if we think of an Astro application, it might have some backend data in the form 

40
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:59,30
of Jason or Markdown documents. But all of these files are actually part 

41
00:02:59,30 --> 00:03:03,40
of a different folder called poem. This is where we create our templates. 

42
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:08,200
This is where we create our different workflows for prompt engineering. And so if 

43
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,400
they're used inside of the Astro application, it's because they're given to it, not 

44
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,430
because they're part of the backend system or the database. 

45
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:19,720
And then when we get to the infrastructure and hosting, well, this is not even relevant 

46
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,320
the way we're 

47
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,790
doing this sort of application. So what I've already seen so far is that this is 

48
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:29,620
building it directly for some sort of full stack application, which is not what we're 

49
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,60
trying to do.

50
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:34,620
Now when we get to the repository structure, this is pretty good. We've got this 

51
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:39,690
monorepo concept with packages for the core and the app. There's also a location 

52
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:45,00
for where poem is. What is not clear here is how it actually runs on someone else's 

53
00:03:45,00 --> 00:03:51,210
system. So how I develop the framework is one thing, but how it's installed elsewhere 

54
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:54,900
is another thing. So we've gotta consider whether it's getting this correct at the 

55
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:59,130
moment. Now we get to the service architecture. This is quite correct. 

56
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:04,890
the only thing is that I would want it to say that this is an instance web server 

57
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:09,900
that gets created for each individual poem implementation. So the fact that it says 

58
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:14,850
configurable is correct, but there's not this clarity that this is an internal service 

59
00:04:15,00 --> 00:04:18,510
that needs to be made available. And if you're running two poem projects, 

60
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,280
You need two Astro servers. 

61
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:26,520
Now we've got integration requirements. Again, everything here looks good, but understanding 

62
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:31,980
how the bmad method would work, it would start building each of these probably sequentially. 

63
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,800
And this would be incorrect approach. So if we look at these support signal convex, 

64
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:43,140
this will not be part of poem at all. What will happen is that when I'm using poem, 

65
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:48,240
I'll want to be able to connect to external systems, and at that point in time, I'll 

66
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,160
create one of these. So what we need is more tooling that allows us to create a provider 

67
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:58,200
rather than an actual implementation of the provider within this framework. 

68
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:03,780
The actual Claude code slash commands. This is interesting. We do need it, but this 

69
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:10,350
is such a small little utility object. This is a small utility story that might happen 

70
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:13,320
towards the end. It's like how do we connect it all up? 

71
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:19,260
Now the handlebars js, this is important, but this is going to live with inside this 

72
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:24,270
service architecture. So we just need to make sure that there's a clear separation. 

73
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:28,530
the more I look at this technical requirements, the more I realize it might've been 

74
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:31,980
useful to create two different Bmad PRDs, 

75
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:36,30
one for the poem core and the other one for the poem app. 

76
00:05:36,30 --> 00:05:40,590
Then we consider faker, which is great. The only challenge we're going to have here 

77
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:45,720
is that we don't fully understand our mock generation system. So this is quite a, 

78
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,370
in the future sort of idea, 

79
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:51,150
security and compliance, this is actually pretty good. 

80
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:55,50
And then it's listing the trade offs. I'm pretty happy with these. So we've got astro 

81
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:55,500
and 

82
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,640
good developer experience. So this is great. We've got our assumptions. This is all 

83
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,470
good. And we've got our technical risks. 

84
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:06,430
So after talking for three minutes and reading through this, and I know that last 

85
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:11,650
night when I looked at this, I thought this was all off kilter. The more I think 

86
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:16,990
about it, the more I realize it's probably okay. And what I'm going to do is include 

87
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:20,500
this video as a separate video, not part of the main video,
