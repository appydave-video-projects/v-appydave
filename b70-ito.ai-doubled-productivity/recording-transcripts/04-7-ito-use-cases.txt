So for the next example I'm going to press control and the function key and
what's going to happen is anything I say will go through a large language model
before it gets written into the text box and since on the AI TLDR channel we do a
lot of movie making one of the things that we've got to do is create scripts
so let's see how it can go with just a simple statement. I need to create a
story about a day in the life of a woman and her cat in New York it should be six
scenes and it should be visually descriptive so that we can build nice
visual animations around it and I just let it go and we see what it types for
us so now we've got a whole lot of information being made available I might
just submit that straight in now I don't have to do that of course in chat GPT
because that's the goal of using a tool like that but the great thing is if you
were doing an email it could pre-write a lot of the email for you
