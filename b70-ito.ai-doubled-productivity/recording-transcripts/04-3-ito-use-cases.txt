So for the first test, what I'd like to do is jump over into ChatGPT and I'm just going
to recite a phrase and I'll probably include Abbey Dave, which is my brand, and also AITLDR,
which is one of my other brands, and we'll see how well it works.
Now the good thing is all you do is you click into the text box, hold down the function
key, and then just start talking.
When you finish, you let go of the function key, and what you'll notice is that it's
a really quick system at turning your voice into text.
