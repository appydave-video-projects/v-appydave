Now the first software I used was Voice Ink and straight up I went this is a lot
better than the Apple dictation system. I looked at the pricing it had a one-time
fee of $25 I was pretty happy with that. The challenges I had using it was that I
wasn't quite happy with the way the keyboard global shortcut worked and it
was a little slow from time to time. At the end of the trial I decided I'll go
and try another application see how it goes and that moves us on to Aqua.
