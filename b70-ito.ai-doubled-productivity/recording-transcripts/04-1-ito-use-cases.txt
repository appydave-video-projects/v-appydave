So I'm going to talk about ITO from four points of view, general access, extensibility, voice
dictation and voice agents.
Now the first one is general access and the great thing is that for most people this is
a free product.
Now they do have Pro and Enterprise coming but it's an open source project so you can
download it, it's really easy to install, it's really easy to use.
