So, let's get going.
Hi, I'm Appy Dave and you can find my community where I talk about context engineering at
appydave.com or if you want to find out my community where we do context engineering
specifically for video generation and storytelling, then you can go to AITLDR.
All I've done is let go and here it is.
And as you notice, that came through really quickly.
Appy Dave has done the way I want my brand to be, which is capital A, capital D, no spaces.
And AITLDR is all uppercase with a dash before it.
And this just stands for too long, didn't read.
