For the last couple of years I've been using Dictation on the Mac and I've had mixed results
with it.
It's okay but it misses words like AppyDave or AITLDR which are part of my brand.
It also has problems with the global hotkey not working.
And a week and a half ago I started watching this video by a YouTuber called A Fading Thought
and this was a really good video and it talked about different voice agents, voice dictation
systems and the pros and cons of them all so I started trying some of them out.
