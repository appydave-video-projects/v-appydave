Now aqua worked pretty much the same way as voice ink it also has a pretty good
pricing model it's eight dollars per month for the pro plan I was just using
the free version for a couple of days what I immediately loved about this
particular product though was that it had a different global hotkey that you
just held it down when you wanted to talk you let it go when you were finished
talking and I found it just more effective I wasn't making mistakes as
often
