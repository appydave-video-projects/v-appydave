Now once the trial for Aqua had finished I started back out of fading thought I was going
to work through these tools one at a time.
One of the things he actually talks about in this video is that many of the tools meet
different requirements for different users.
But the reality for me is that the next tool on the list solved all the problems I wanted.
And so what I'm going to show you is Ito and why for me this is such an incredibly powerful
tool to use.
