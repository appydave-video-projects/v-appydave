00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:06,830
If you're like me, then you love using tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude. But 

2
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:10,800
if you're not happy using the keyboard, you might find it a little bit limiting. 

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,960
In this video, we're going to look at voice dictation and voice agents and see how, 

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,870
over the last week, my own productivity has doubled just by implementing such a simple 

5
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:23,320
system. I'm AppyDave. Let's get into it.

6
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,600
For the last couple of years, I've been using dictation on the Mac and I've had mixed 

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:34,160
results with it. It's okay, but it misses words like AppyDave or AI-TLDR, which are 

8
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,520
part of my brand. It also has problems with the global hotkey not working. And a 

9
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,600
week and a half ago I started watching this video by

10
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,350
a YouTuber called A Fading Thought. And this was a really good video and it talked 

11
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:52,710
about different voice agents, voice dictation systems, and the pros and cons of them 

12
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,760
all. So I started trying some of them out.

13
00:00:54,760 --> 00:01:00,440
Now. The first software I used was Voice ink and straight up I went. This is a lot 

14
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:06,40
better than the Apple dictation system. I looked at the pricing. It had a one time 

15
00:01:06,40 --> 00:01:12,120
fee of $25. It was pretty happy with that. The challenges I had using it was that 

16
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:17,640
I wasn't quite happy with the way the keyboard global shortcut worked, and it was 

17
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,240
a little slow from time to time. At the end of the trial, I decided, I'll go and 

18
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,870
try another application and see how it goes, and that moves us on to Aqua.

19
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:32,790
Now Aqua worked pretty much the same way as voice ink. It also has a pretty good 

20
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:38,710
pricing model. It's $8 per month for the Pro plan. I was just using the free version 

21
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:43,910
for a couple of days. What I immediately loved about this particular product, though, 

22
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,790
was that it had a different global hotkey that you just held it down when you wanted 

23
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:53,510
to talk. You let it go when you were finished talking, and I found it just more effective. 

24
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:55,550
I wasn't making mistakes as often.

25
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,30
Now. Once the trial for Aqua had finished, I started back out of fading. Thought 

26
00:02:00,30 --> 00:02:04,310
I was going to work through these tools one at a time. One of the things he actually 

27
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:09,280
talks about in this video is that many of the tools meet different requirements for 

28
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,960
different users, but the reality for me is that the next tool on the list solved 

29
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:19,350
all the problems I wanted. And so what I'm going to show you is Ito and why. For 

30
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:23,240
me, this is such an incredibly powerful tool to use.

31
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:29,30
So I'm going to talk about Ito from four points of view general access, extensibility, 

32
00:02:29,80 --> 00:02:34,750
voice dictation, and voice agents. Now the first one is general access. And the great 

33
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:39,680
thing is that for most people this is a free product. Now they do have pro and enterprise 

34
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,360
coming, but it's an open source project so you can download it. 

35
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,120
It's really easy to install. 

36
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,630
It's really easy to use.

37
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:52,200
Now the next criteria is extensibility. And what's great about this is it's a GitHub 

38
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:57,360
repo. What that means is that all the code for this tool is available. You can download 

39
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,960
it. They've got instructions on how to use it including a video. They've got all 

40
00:03:02,00 --> 00:03:07,00
the instructions for getting it compiling on your computer, plus a bunch of communication 

41
00:03:07,00 --> 00:03:10,520
flow and keyboard shortcuts that you can work with. 

42
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:14,310
and what this means is that if you want data privacy or if you want to integrate 

43
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:18,600
it into any of your own applications, it becomes really easy to do.

44
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:23,360
So for the first test, what I'd like to do is jump over into ChatGPT and I'm just 

45
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,960
going to recite a phrase and I'll probably include AppyDave, which is my brand, and 

46
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:34,760
also AI-TLDR, which is one of my other brands, and we'll see how well it works. Now, 

47
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,680
the good thing is, all you do is you click into the text box, hold down 

48
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,760
the function key, and then just start talking. When you finish, 

49
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:46,320
you let go of the function key. And what you'll notice is that it's a really quick 

50
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,920
system at turning your voice into text.

51
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:55,480
So let's get going. Hi, I'm AppyDave and you can find my community where I talk about 

52
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:02,00
Context Engineering at AppyDave. Com or if you want to find out my community where 

53
00:04:02,00 --> 00:04:08,120
we do Context Engineering specifically for video generation and storytelling, then 

54
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,400
you can go to AI-TLDR.

55
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,40
All I've done is let go and here it is.

56
00:04:15,40 --> 00:04:19,440
And as you notice, that came through really quickly. AppyDave was done the way I 

57
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:25,880
want my brand to be, which is capital A, capital D, no spaces, and AI-TLDR is all 

58
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:31,160
uppercase with a dash before it and this just stands for too long. Didn't read.

59
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,150
Now in the video, you wouldn't have seen anything showing up visually, but on the 

60
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:40,100
bottom of my screen there is a little voice icon and that was moving as I was talking, 

61
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:46,520
but you might be wondering how did it get AppyDave and AI-TLDR. Now to look at that, 

62
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:51,260
we need to go and check out the settings. So here you can see the average word speed. 

63
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:55,460
The total words that I've done, I've been using it for a couple of days at the moment, 

64
00:04:55,790 --> 00:05:01,130
and it's got a dictionary. So within the dictionary I've got AI-TLDR AppyDave. I'm 

65
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:05,690
always in context engineering, talking about the bmad method, and I've got some other 

66
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:10,550
sorts of computing terms and my full name in here. The other thing is we've got the 

67
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:14,270
settings, and this is where you can play around with the keyboard shortcuts. I'm 

68
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:18,770
using the function key, which is the default, but we've got another one. And that's 

69
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:19,40
the 

70
00:05:19,40 --> 00:05:20,300
control function key. 

71
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:24,790
and that puts us into intelligence mode, where the large language model can intercept 

72
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:27,310
whatever we say. Let's go check that out.

73
00:05:28,70 --> 00:05:32,950
So when you're using standard dictation, it's basically Wysiwyg. What you see is 

74
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:37,70
what you get. And this is really perfect for a large language model. You put it in 

75
00:05:37,70 --> 00:05:41,630
and then you get some information back. But what if you wanted to put in information 

76
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:44,750
directly that had gone through a large language model? 

77
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:49,270
So for the next example, I'm going to press control. And the function key and what's 

78
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:54,520
going to happen is anything I say will go through a large language model before it 

79
00:05:54,520 --> 00:06:00,170
gets written into the text box. And since on the AI-TLDR channel, we do a lot of 

80
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:05,440
movie making, one of the things that we've gotta do is create scripts. So let's see 

81
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,00
how it can go with just a simple statement. 

82
00:06:08,00 --> 00:06:15,500
I need to create a story about a day in the life of a woman and her cat in New York. 

83
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:21,410
It should be six scenes and it should be visually descriptive so that we can build 

84
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:23,330
nice visual animations around it. 

85
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:27,580
And I just let it go and we see what it types for us. So now we've got a whole lot 

86
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:33,280
of information being made available. I might just submit that straight in. Now I 

87
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,900
don't have to do that, of course, in chat GPT, because that's the goal of using a 

88
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:42,370
tool like that. But the great thing is if you were doing an email, it could pre-write 

89
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:43,960
a lot of the email for you.

90
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:48,80
And there we have our first scene for our story. Now the performance issue is not 

91
00:06:48,80 --> 00:06:52,520
with the human, now it's with Sora. That took about a minute and a half to do, but 

92
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:58,440
the actual creation of this process is so incredibly quick because we can both do 

93
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:03,320
voice dictation and we can do voice transformation through large language models.

94
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:09,200
So that's Ito. It just allows you to talk directly to the computer quickly, and it 

95
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:15,200
works in other languages. I'm AppyDave what I do is I educate people on Context Engineering 

96
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:20,640
specifically for coding, storytelling and business processes. So if that's of interest 

97
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,720
to you, maybe you want to join the community, the links down in the description. 

98
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,280
Otherwise I'm AppyDave. See you in the next video.
