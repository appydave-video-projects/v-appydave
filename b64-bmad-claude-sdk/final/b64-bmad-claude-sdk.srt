00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,840
Imagine building a self-editing application. What that means is that you could talk to it and it

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:11,840
generates all the data in the back end or you could ask it to visualize it and html pages suddenly

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:19,440
materialized. In this video we're going to use the Agent SDK from Claude Code to do that and we're

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:24,400
going to build this application using the BMAD method. I'm Abbey Dade, let's get into it. Now

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,840
this video is a step-by-step tutorial so if you want to move ahead or go backwards and forwards

6
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:35,040
check out the chapter links in the description. Now what we're building today is this self-editing

7
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:41,520
application. We're going to use the Claude Agent SDK and the BMAD method. Now if this all works

8
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,040
what we'll be demonstrating is the idea of creating a bunch of products building out a product listing

9
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:53,360
maybe even a details page for it adding a home page making some of those products featured and

10
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:59,440
then adding more products along the way. Now the magic of a self-editing application is firstly this

11
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:05,840
human experience so we'll be able to talk to the computer have it generate features have it generate

12
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:12,320
data and we'll be doing that using vibe coding sort of techniques but the technical reality of

13
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:19,040
this is that we're going to use context engineering using the BMAD method and tools like the Agent SDK

14
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:25,200
to make this application a reality. So our Agent SDK application is built and this is what it can

15
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,960
do for us. So we're going into the chat bot where we're going to enter in some products we should be

16
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,840
able to view those products and see that they're being stored in the back end at any time we should

17
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:42,080
be able to create a HTML page notice that there's a live activity there's also live pages if we click

18
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:47,120
on the pages we should be able to go and see the products listing at any time then we should be

19
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:52,960
able to add a new product or update it and it should come through instantaneously. If we need

20
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,240
a home page we should be able to add a link and create a home page at the same time when we go

21
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,280
to that home page we should be able to navigate back to the products and at the end of the video

22
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:09,360
there's a complex multi-page workflow demonstration. Now let's just talk a little bit about the

23
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,960
planning ahead of time so I've already got a planning folder in place for what we're going to

24
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:20,880
do. I've got some preliminary tech stack stuff but I want to run all of this through the BMAD

25
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:26,000
method. Now which version of the BMAD method should we use? Should we use version four which

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,280
is the current or should we use the version six alpha nine? Now I tried a video yesterday on alpha

27
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:39,440
eight and I don't particularly believe it's ready for use just yet for this sort of project so we're

28
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,640
going to work with version four and that means what we're going to do is use this command here

29
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:50,880
npx BMAD method in store. If you do want to use the version six it's all available. Now the problems

30
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:57,200
I ran into with version six I've already communicated with Brian from BMAD and he's aware of it and

31
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,960
he's talking through the changes that are coming in place related to those issues but for today

32
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:08,160
we'll keep it simple and work in version four. Now in the repo that we're building all this which is

33
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:14,880
07 BMAD Claude SDK you can go to the bottom and find the links so here's the link to the version

34
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:21,360
for BMAD and if you scroll down a little bit we'll go and select our starting command. With that

35
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:27,360
selected we can go over to our terminal and I've already got some pages here. The readme that you

36
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:34,480
were just seeing is in here at that location and I've got a planning phase in my documents directory

37
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:41,200
already. So we've cleared the screen and putting in the npx BMAD method in store and that's going

38
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:47,280
to walk us through a wizard. So let's work through it step by step and the first thing is the folder.

39
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:53,440
Now it's opened it up to an npx directory so what I'm going to do is put in the directory

40
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:59,440
where we're building this application today. After that it's talking about different frameworks of

41
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:05,440
BMAD that we can install. This all changes a fair bit in version six we've got better games

42
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:11,440
set up in that particular version. For now we'll just go with the Agile Core. In version four when

43
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:17,840
it comes to the PRD product requirements document and the architecture document you can shard the

44
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:23,760
files meaning that they can be split up into individual files after generation. This changes

45
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:29,520
a little bit in version six but for today we'll say yes and then you can decide on what agent

46
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:35,040
coding system you're going to use. I'm using Claude Code so we'll just select that and in this example

47
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,920
we're not going to use Gemini or Codec so I'm going to say no to those models. Now it started

48
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:45,440
off with this idea of reading the user guide so we'll take a copy of that and head over to

49
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:51,120
Visual Studio. Now let's have a look at what I already had in place. So I already have a docs

50
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,400
folder with just this planning directory so there's a fair bit of spikes and examples

51
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:02,880
of how this application could work. We'll draw on that when we're building our product brief.

52
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,360
We've got a Claude file in place we've got our Claude subfolder and you'll notice that there's

53
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:13,120
an area called commands so all the BMAD methods have been set up within this area and then the

54
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:20,480
rest of BMAD is in the BMAD Core where we've got different workflows, teams, templates for working

55
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:26,000
through checklists, we've got our agents and we've got this little user guide that it told us to

56
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,000
read so let's pop that up. We've got a user guide for the Greenfield project so this is a brand new

57
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,160
project. Brownfield is for if you've already got an existing code base and we can start with a

58
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:44,000
project idea. We've got an optional analyst research now we don't need that because I've

59
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,200
already done all the planning but we might just work through it temporarily to see what it does.

60
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:54,160
Then we've got to build the brief so with the brief we're doing the product requirements

61
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,680
document, we'll do a bit of UX design, we'll do a little bit of architecture design and then at the

62
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,400
end we'll make it all cohesive and with the cohesion in place that's when we'll start using

63
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:11,200
a scrub master to design stories and a developer to actually create the code for those stories.

64
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:16,080
So let's start with our terminal and we're going to use Claude code and I'm going to run it with

65
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,920
the dangerously skipped permissions. Now it's fresh context and we've just added a lot of

66
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:27,360
context from Claude so I'm just going to run and knit on this. I'm going to give it a little bit

67
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:33,440
of extra information. We've got this planning folder but I don't want it to take too much over

68
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,480
with the Claude file. I want it to be referenced, I want it to maybe use it as a guideline for what

69
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:44,720
the project will be about but the main focus of Claude should be on the BMAD method and whatever

70
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,440
it decides to create. So with those two statements what we can see is that we're

71
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:55,520
improving the Claude MD to prioritize the BMAD workflow. So what is Claude MD?

72
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:01,440
That's essentially the system prompt so it's available every time we do a prompt that anything

73
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:07,520
in this file will be used and we want it to be hyper focused on what it does. So anything in red

74
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:13,360
has been removed and that's a lot of the stuff that I did in pre-planning before this video. We

75
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,640
can see that my folder hierarchy that does exist has been removed from the system prompt

76
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:24,960
but the important stuff that it's a self-editing application is in place, that the core of the

77
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:30,480
server should only be about 200 lines of code. It's got a very clean understanding of what the

78
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:35,680
BMAD workflow is. So we've got the workflow primary path, we've got step one which is

79
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:41,120
installation. Now we've already done that. We've got step two which will be the analyst agent

80
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:46,960
doing a workflow init and it just keeps going doing this hyper focused system prompt. So we'll

81
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,680
start off by having a fresh version of Claude and we'll put in a slash command and the one we're

82
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,360
going to go with is analyst and analyst will load up Mary. Now there's a lot of things that

83
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:03,920
Mary can do. For this session mostly we're going to focus on creating a project brief but she's

84
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:10,160
one of these agents that you can spend a long time in just doing all sorts of planning and research.

85
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:16,880
So we just go back to Claude code and we'll have create a project brief by reading an existing

86
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:23,280
document and if we put in the at sign we can start putting in project reference and we'll select it

87
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:29,600
and we'll see what she can do with that particular document. So the create project brief is going to

88
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:35,760
read from our project reference and what it does is it uses commands like the create doc which is

89
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:41,680
based on a template already in the BMAD core and for this we're going to work in the interactive

90
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:48,320
mode. So we'll just press one. YOLO would be the fast way to do it and with my project documentation

91
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,920
it could just work out perfectly but I want to be pretty sure with this. So notice that the output

92
00:08:53,920 --> 00:09:00,240
file is going to be docs brief and we can see that it's working through many to-dos. Currently

93
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,960
it's written the executive summary for it and I've read it through. It's all pretty perfect.

94
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:10,800
I think the target market says it all. It's developers learning AI agent integration and

95
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:16,720
self-modifying systems. It's for technical educators. That's what I do where I want to

96
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,680
generate systems that are a bit flexible and dynamic pretty quickly. That's also rapid

97
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,640
prototyping. That's what we're doing today and then we've got the BMAD method practitioners.

98
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:33,120
Now one thing is to know that I'll be testing this with version 6 BMAD and if there is anything you

99
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,200
want me to test it with let me know in the comments below but for now we'll just proceed

100
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,360
to the next section and the good thing is it started writing the brief so we'll just bring

101
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:48,320
up Visual Studio and click on this file here and so as it goes we can keep track of what's going

102
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,360
on the left hand side but let's have a look at this problem statement that it's come up with.

103
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,840
So reading through the problem statement everything's pretty good. One of the things I

104
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:02,000
notice is the database. This is where this application will be a little different to a

105
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,920
lot of applications. It won't have a database. Instead it's just going to have JSON documents,

106
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:14,080
JSOM. They're going to be stored in the server and for saving them it's just going to be committed

107
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:19,520
to a repository. Now this is not a normal application that you would run in the cloud I guess

108
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:25,440
but for me it allows me to rapidly create tools that I use locally on my computer through a web

109
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:31,920
interface. So I think we can just move on to the next section and what it will start doing is

110
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:37,920
writing an updated brief. We should see it pop in below. It's updating so we can see a whole new

111
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:43,680
green section and here it is listed in the markdown document. Now if there was anything

112
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:48,640
out of whack with it rather than using Claude to change it you might just manually come in

113
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:55,440
and alter the document here to have it to rectify any flaws that you notice. It's important also

114
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:01,760
that you do rectify flaws because these propagate through. If you fix it now you have less issues

115
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:07,760
in the future. So the next area we're going to work on is the proposed solution section. So it's

116
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:13,840
written the proposed solution. If we go over and have a look we can see that it's going to use an

117
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:20,480
express JavaScript server. Embedded into it will be a Claude Agent SDK back end. Some of the tools

118
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:26,400
that we'll have is the ability to read and write JSON files and also to write HTML files. The main

119
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:33,040
front end technology is that we'll use React with socket IO so that we can stream information live

120
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:38,160
and we're going to use BMAB method version 4. There's also a little note here about using

121
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:45,200
for the user interface. We might also use the Versel AI elements. Now the back end is meant

122
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:50,800
to be simple. Just about 200 lines of code and one of the key requirements is that I can just

123
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:56,720
use it with my Max account from Claude. I don't need to go and pay any API costs with this

124
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:02,800
particular tool. Now while that's been happening in the background it's been setting up the target

125
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:08,640
users. We'll get it to start writing that brief for us. Once it's done the target users section

126
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:14,480
it should move on automatically to the goals and success metrics. All I've had to do each time

127
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:20,320
is basically say the next number for it to save the file. So the target users have been

128
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,280
updated. It should go directly into the next area but if we have a look at the target users

129
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:30,240
we can see that it's a learning system for developers but I would argue that it's for

130
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,120
anyone that wants to learn context engineering which is partly about building applications but

131
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:41,120
it's about building any system in a business or in your personal workflows. This is also an area

132
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,920
that you could pull out because I think anyone should be able to learn this. One of the things

133
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:52,320
about what we're doing is that we're not writing any code ourselves. Everything is just understanding

134
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:58,400
a little bit of architecture, following a plan and using natural language processes the entire

135
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:04,960
way. So now it's about to create the goals and success metrics. We've already written

136
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:11,120
all the target user information. It reads the brief each time, does what it needs to do and

137
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,520
then writes the brief again and you might be wondering what does it need to do? How does it

138
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:21,440
know to do that? And this is just one of the internal mechanisms of the BMAD method. So now

139
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:27,440
the KPIs or the key performance indicators have been updated. We can go look at it while we move

140
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:33,600
on to the next section. One of the things I would suggest is in this case they're not that useful

141
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:40,240
for me. I don't really care about these numbers here. 1000 developers clone or fork the repository,

142
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,760
not important to me. Content amplification, if people use it I'd be really happy about that.

143
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:51,840
I guess if anything was important is that people are using a sound content engineering system which

144
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:57,920
is BMAD method. But quite frankly this section is a bit of fluff today for us but the next area

145
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:04,320
is really important and this is the minimum viable product. And so as a must have it's working on the

146
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:10,000
idea of it having three epics. Now this is not normal by the way, this is not the normal area to

147
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:17,520
put in epics. Usually we do that after we've done the architecture and the PRD and it comes later.

148
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:22,320
But I put this specifically into my planning documents because I'm thinking of this as a

149
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,600
simple application with three different areas that we need to do. We need a foundation, that's the

150
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,880
server, the client, it just needs to be set up. After that the back end is the main area that we

151
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:39,680
want to work on. For the Claude Agent SDK implementation I've already done what's called

152
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:47,360
a core loop or the event loop documentation and essentially this is just a human readable list

153
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,640
it should work no matter what target language this system is built for. Now we are going for

154
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:58,160
JavaScript and so hopefully that'll translate pretty readily. And then the third area is that

155
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:04,480
we're going to have a beautiful user interface so this is basically using the Verso and ShadCN and

156
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:11,760
Tailwind CSS and just getting it to talk to the back end with streams. And as that information

157
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:19,040
hits the SDK perform any data creation or web page designs as we go. And the next section of

158
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:25,680
the MVP is what not to do. So we don't need a database, we don't need multi-tenancy, multi-user,

159
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:31,360
we don't need authentication or authorization, we don't need model context protocol. Good thing

160
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,960
about using BMAD is that I've used it for enterprise applications really effectively so it can do all

161
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:44,000
of these but we're keeping it out of the example. So after that we're going to build the post-MVP

162
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,360
or the post-minimum viable product vision and we can see that it's already come up with most of

163
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,880
that. It's got different tools that we might want to add later on and additional areas like multi-agent

164
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:00,160
workflows, production release. Now quite frankly I could maybe delete all of this and be happy

165
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:06,480
because I'm not planning to go further with this particular project. It's going to be the foundation

166
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:12,240
for other tools that you'll see me creating using the BMAD method. So it's gone off and now

167
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:17,680
thought about the technical considerations they've all been set up. It feels that we need to use

168
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:24,480
React version 19 and if we look at it in the mark down it's TypeScript and Vite, ShadCN, Tailwind,

169
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,680
CSS. This is all for the front end. If we look a bit further we've got the back end which is an

170
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:35,840
express server. We've got an installation of the agent SDK planned. We're going to communicate

171
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:41,920
between the two systems with socket IO and we're running it on Node. For our database it's just

172
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:47,120
going to be some JSON documents in the data directory. Future we could use a database if

173
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:52,560
we like and the hosting is it's just planned to run on localhost. So with that we can go and look

174
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:59,120
at the next section. It's currently working on the constraints and assumptions so this was a big thing

175
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:05,920
for me. Is it going to cost me anything? No, I want it to hook into my Mac's account and that

176
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:12,640
should be how it works. Developer time 40 to 60 hours for the MVP. Let's go and look at the

177
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:19,760
risk and open question and this is really useful. I've never done the agent SDK so it is a dependency

178
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:26,320
with high risk for me when I'm doing this video. The constraint, I think that the statement here

179
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:30,880
could be true but I don't think it matters. It's not that I have to do it in 200 lines of code,

180
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,560
it's just that I don't want it to be complex. That's kind of why I'm doing the constraint.

181
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:39,920
I will talk about this section briefly. I took out a section called the BMAD quality gates.

182
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:46,160
What I wanted to have happen is that rather than pure vibe coding where the user says I would like

183
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:53,040
a new home page, I wanted it to actually create a BMAD story on the back end. Now I think for this

184
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:59,040
demonstration it's maybe a reach goal, maybe we'll do it but this would be a really powerful

185
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:05,440
idea that users could just sit on the front end and say I want a new capability and BMAD

186
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,320
at the other end hears that and says well let me create a story for you and then the developer

187
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:16,240
can go off and create it. But for today I've taken it out. So that's the docs brief finish.

188
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:21,920
You notice it's now saying to go on to the next agent. It's got everything written. What we're

189
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:29,120
going to do is exit out because what I'd like to do is have a clean context the next time we start

190
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:35,120
but while we're looking at that let's just see what that last section was. So we've got the next

191
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:40,560
step immediate action is we're going to create the product requirements document. We're going to do

192
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:46,800
that by loading the project manager agent and running the create PRD command. Let's also look

193
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:52,560
at what we've got in our system. So everything that you see on the left in planning is stuff I've

194
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:59,040
done ahead of time. So the only one document we have in the system specifically created by BMAD

195
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:04,160
is the brief. Now I'll just take a moment out to suggest that if you want a little bit more

196
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:11,680
hand-holding or just seeing day-to-day operations on using the BMAD method context engineering to

197
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:16,560
produce applications or other sorts of business systems then you might want to check the link in

198
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:21,120
the description where you can go to my school community where I'll be talking about this on a

199
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:27,840
day-by-day basis but next let's go and look at creating this PRD. Now to do that we're going to

200
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:33,520
have a new agent and the agent we want is the project manager. So we load the project manager

201
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:39,120
in with the slash PM command and John comes into existence with a whole lot of capabilities. Now

202
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:45,600
the one we want is the star create PRD. So we just paste that in and let's see what comes up

203
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:51,040
and you notice that the way BMAD works is it works with context documents so we've got the create doc

204
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:57,120
dot md there was also a template going on which we can see here and a bit of configuration yaml.

205
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:02,160
Now in version 6 a lot of this stuff still happens similarly but they've made it a lot more

206
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:07,840
flexible. Now you may notice when you start with a clean cloud code is that the context is empty

207
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:13,280
and so certain things it doesn't know about. So this idea of do you have a project brief which

208
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:19,120
we just worked on is something it doesn't currently know about. So I'm just going to put in one that's

209
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:24,800
what we want to do and I'll put in the app sign and start typing brief and we'll just press enter

210
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:31,200
so it'll use that as loaded context. So it's read in the brief I've read it everything seems okay to

211
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:37,440
me so I'm just going to press one and continue on that. Notice as it goes it creates a change log

212
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:43,040
so we've got version one which is the initial PRD created from the project brief and now we get into

213
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:48,160
the hearts of what a product requirements document is we're coming up with the functional

214
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:54,160
requirements as we go so FR1 would be the first functional requirement so it's listing all the

215
00:20:54,160 --> 00:21:00,320
basic capabilities that this application is going to do and then after that it does the non-functional

216
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:07,120
requirements which is all abstractions or ideas that the system's going to work on such as the

217
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:12,640
line limit on the server the fact that we're going to use Claude auth to log into the system.

218
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:18,880
Now like with the interactive mode with product brief we could just move on to the next section

219
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:25,760
but it's got a couple of areas needing validation is 200 lines realistic and should we have pre-built

220
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:32,480
examples. So I'm just going to make a simple adjustment here it says the 200 is a suggestion

221
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:38,480
what I'm trying to do is have the actual event loop of the agent be fairly small and contained

222
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:44,080
there's not a lot that you need to do there but this is a guideline it's not a limit at all what

223
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:50,240
I wanted to ensure that it does is not create complex structures as it builds out this system

224
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:55,120
because there's nothing complex about the Claude code event loop the other thing I wanted to talk

225
00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:00,640
about is this area of should we have a pre-built example application no we shouldn't this is all

226
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:06,480
vibe coding that we're going to ask people to do but we may actually create some examples later

227
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:11,360
on so we'll just press enter on that and so the functional requirements have been updated we've

228
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:16,960
removed a concept and we've done slight updates and so this is a lot more important than in the

229
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:22,880
brief to get this right so we'll move on to the next step but the idea is that this is what's

230
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:28,160
actually going to get built. Now the user interface design guides have come through I've read through

231
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:34,560
all of this and most of it was good except there was one area and probably the core area

232
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:40,560
which is these screens and this is not working the way I'm thinking so the first thing it says is

233
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:46,320
chat interface primary screen full height chat with message history input field streaming indicator

234
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:53,600
and example starters love that that is the only thing that I saw this initial application having

235
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:58,960
it's then got concept of a status panel shows active story recent file operations quality

236
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:05,680
gait status now that's more complexity than I need my thoughts were that as soon as you started

237
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:10,880
typing stuff in here you could generate html in the back end and now that doesn't necessarily

238
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:16,080
mean the menus would work but the actual pages should work I had a plan for this particular

239
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:21,120
application that be mad stories would get generated that's what the quality gates were but then I've

240
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:26,320
taken it out made it a future thing so if we go to the very bottom I said this section here doesn't

241
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:31,200
make sense anymore and then I've said the next two steps which are these ones down here which I've

242
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:36,960
copied from above are too complex and I've given it a little bit more clarity on what to do so

243
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:42,800
we'll just run with that again it's so important in this area that you actually get it stating

244
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:47,920
exactly what you think you want to see so it's come through red is what it's changing green is

245
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:54,320
what it's changing it to you can see it's continuing with simplified user interface but

246
00:23:54,320 --> 00:24:00,320
we can also go over to visual studio and have a look at the document like before here in a simple

247
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:06,400
markdown viewer so be mad Claude self-editing application we've got our functional requirements

248
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:11,920
kicking into place here and we can see some of the modifications like the slash chat and the

249
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:18,880
products as examples so we go back to our conversation and this makes a whole lot more

250
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,840
sense we've got the application presents as a minimal chat interface we know it can generate

251
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:29,440
concepts like products and blogs even though there may not be a navigation menu in place

252
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:34,320
the one little bit of styling we'll have is that it can do dark mode and light mode and so we can

253
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:39,760
move on to the next step there is one big issue in here and this is the issue of anyone using

254
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:46,000
coding is that this application when we build it will allow us to change our backend server

255
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,840
now that's both a security issue you wouldn't do this on a public website this is an internal tool

256
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:58,000
but it means how do we manage those changes and i'm assuming in my setup that i'm going to use

257
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,040
git commit so i should be able to roll back but that's not necessarily the most technically

258
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:07,920
easy thing for people to use but for this example that's how i'm planning to do it now here what

259
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:14,240
it's done is come up with the technical assumptions they're all based off the project brief which is

260
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:19,600
great i've read through all of them and they're all very accurate this is exactly the way i see

261
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:25,440
it happening but i thought i'd point out one area so where did this all come from it came from

262
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:30,160
something called the storyline app now i think it's important that we look at the storyline

263
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:35,360
application because the catalyst for building this project was could we generate stories

264
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:42,880
dynamically on the fly so if we head over to a web view and we're looking at what is a client

265
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:48,240
and server sort of system so currently we are connected to the server and it's using the same

266
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:54,320
technology we're about to build and if we go and have a look at our project files we've got something

267
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:59,200
called the boy and the baker now the boy and the baker is a five minute video that we've created

268
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:04,480
and when you look at it you can see that it's the story and the story starts off with an elderly

269
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:11,120
baker what's into his shot to seize a boy being beaten and bullied by some younger children so we

270
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:17,760
can see pictures of this baker along the way now if we go and toggle the image display we can see

271
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:24,320
that we got an establishing shot we've also got other versions of the shot available so as we

272
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:29,760
move through this story and it goes for five minutes all of these images are character

273
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:35,920
consistent their theme and style consistent and so we build our movie by using the image prompts

274
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:42,160
with tools like dali3 and so on and we use the animation prompts along the way for doing the

275
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:49,040
animations in halo or vo3 the interesting thing is that everything that you're seeing is based

276
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:54,400
off this one narrative so we've got a little narrative it creates setting the ambience characters

277
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:59,120
the description we got the image prompt and we've got the animation prompt and i've been going

278
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:05,040
through and refactoring this so that this is a lot more deeper but really i just want to type this

279
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:10,960
into a text box and have all of this extra information generated for me automatically and

280
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,760
that's what this application is meant to do we should just be able to save something into a text

281
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:21,520
box and have complex data structures form around that information so let me give you a glimpse of

282
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:27,040
what the application we're currently building can be used for and it's this storyline application

283
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:34,080
that generated this movie we've got character consistency scene consistency and everything was

284
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:40,720
generated using clawed code in the background to generate the data structures so as we start

285
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:48,000
asking questions like can you create three products that will generate complex json documents behind

286
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,880
the scene well that's what's happened with the storyline application but instead there's a simple

287
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:59,520
narrative that converts into image and style guides now if you're interested in seeing the

288
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:06,160
five minute video around the boy and the baker by vos then check out the link in the description

289
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:12,000
below but for now let's get back to john our product manager so i just press one to move

290
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,960
forward and we've got our epic list and it looks like there's going to be three epics which is what

291
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:23,680
i'd suggested it to do anyway so we've got the mono repo set up with basic client and server npm

292
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:29,760
workspaces we're going to express server minimal html client so that looks good after that we're

293
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:36,320
really working on the back end which is the agent sdk integration it's going to have the three tools

294
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,640
that are talked about and then we're going to polish up the communication with the front end

295
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:46,560
chat interface here so then we've got our sequencing logic i think the good bit is the

296
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:53,040
story count it's listing three to four stories per epic there isn't a lot of work in each section

297
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:58,400
and then it's listed its rationale and decisions i read through that this all seems to make sense

298
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:05,280
for me so at this point we've got many stories already set up for different epics the first one

299
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:11,520
is mono repo set up with a client in the server so the basic application structure for the front

300
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:17,280
end talking to the back end next we have epic number two which is essentially setting up the

301
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:23,920
clawed agent sdk so that it can communicate from server through to the client and when you look at

302
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:30,800
the goal there's also tools included such as talking to jason and html files and the final epic

303
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:38,000
number three is all about building a react front end and using libraries like shad cn and tailwind

304
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:44,000
css now if we go back to the top of the epic we'll see that every story follows a common

305
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:50,000
formula that's designed for agile development so firstly we've got a story number so in this case

306
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:56,560
it's 1.1 then we've got a simple title for what the story is going to be about this is initializing

307
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:03,280
the workspace and the mono repo so the idea of a user story is this three-part formula that says

308
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:09,520
as a particular person using the capability what do they want to achieve that's the i want

309
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:15,600
and if they did achieve it what would they get then there's an acceptance criteria so this story

310
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:21,520
is considered complete when all of these items are checked off and this concept is going to

311
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:26,400
repeat through every story in the epic so what i'll do now is i'll read through every story

312
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:31,600
headline and then we'll see pretty quickly that there may be some flaws in the way that it's

313
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:37,280
come up with so the first thing it wants to do in the epic is initialize the npm workspaces and

314
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:43,520
mono repo that sounds really good then it's going to create an express type script server

315
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:49,680
after that it's going to get a very basic html client up and running and finally we're just

316
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:55,280
going to have a little bit of an end-to-end test and mainly that'll be worked out by starting both

317
00:30:55,280 --> 00:31:01,680
servers and checking the browser logs checking the console logs so so far epic number one looks

318
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:06,320
pretty good we'll see if it needs any changes when we look at the next step epic so now we're

319
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:13,040
moving on to epic 2 which is all about setting up the anthropic clawed sdk and it talks about

320
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:17,920
let's get it installed seems like a good first step after that is trying to implement one of

321
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:24,160
the tools which is the read json then it's going to do the right json and the right file and then

322
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:29,840
after all of that we're going to integrate socket streaming and we're going to do it both for the

323
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:35,040
server but we're also going to have the chat messages working with this and then after that

324
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:41,360
we're going to implement the full event loop now it's this particular epic that i'm having a few

325
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:46,320
challenges with and i'll go over what they are soon and how i can change them pretty quickly

326
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:52,320
but let's look at the third epic now the third epic is all about setting up a react application

327
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:59,280
as the front end so when we look at 3.1 it's initializing react with vite application

328
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:06,400
then 3.2 is setting up shad cn configuring it with tailwind css after that we build the chat

329
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:12,320
interface using the verse cell ai elements and lastly we're just giving it a simple light mode

330
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:17,520
dark mode now we've got all sorts of rationale being listed we could move on from there but

331
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:24,000
like i said i think there's a problem in epic 2 and the main issues i can see is that after

332
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:30,640
installing the sdk it starts going into setting up tools but we haven't defined yet where they

333
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:35,840
fit into the event loop we don't even know whether the event loop is going to work and

334
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:40,880
communicate correctly with the client and so as we work through all the stories in epic 2 we're

335
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:46,000
going to be pretty blind to whether they're working until the very end of the epic where

336
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,760
it all comes together in a big avalanche so to resolve this problem i could have a conversation

337
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:58,240
here but what i find easier is to just start selecting the context we need and what i've done

338
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:04,080
is copied all the way up to when the epic first started at this point i just select that put it

339
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:09,120
in the clipboard after that i just like to open a new conversation which i've got down below

340
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:13,760
and i've started it with the statement i want to read and absorb the following information

341
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:18,800
and then wait for me for guidance and that complete epic list has been pasted in so that

342
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:24,080
new conversation knows what we've got i've got it highlighted in blue and i just tell it that

343
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:29,840
you're going to help me build up an instruction that we can put back into the previous conversation

344
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:36,000
so the goal of this conversation is purely to build a prompt to paste into this conversation

345
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,600
but before we get started i ask it to do a bit of a q&a session with me to get clarity around

346
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:48,720
the problems as i see it i tell it that i'm pretty happy with epic 1 i think it's good but i think

347
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:53,760
there's stuff that we're going to talk about in epic 2 that will impact it so i just prepare it

348
00:33:53,760 --> 00:34:00,000
to know that it can change epic 1 even though at the moment it's pretty good after that i went

349
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:06,720
through epic 2 and each of the stories and i just gave it this long diatribe now i was just dictating

350
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:12,800
directly into the microphone it was writing out everything as we go and so the good thing about

351
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:18,640
this is it can make it more readable for me so the first thing it does is start to unpack the issues

352
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:27,200
that i had addressed figured out that stories 2.2 2.3 and 2.4 can't be properly verified until we've

353
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:32,000
done the event loop it also worked out that the event loop is not a single story there's both a

354
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,680
beginning and an incremental development of it before it finishes it identified from my

355
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:44,080
conversation that what was called story 2.4 was actually two different concepts one was the

356
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:49,600
streaming client area the other was the same streaming client but specifically for the agent

357
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:56,800
sdk and this also led it to understanding that 1.4 might need some modifications now because i asked

358
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:02,320
it to do a q and a system it actually came up with four pretty solid questions but one of the

359
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:08,320
things i noticed while reading them was it kind of suggested the answers as it went so it's a

360
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:14,000
question of is it asking me questions or does it already have good recommendations and i just need

361
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,360
to sign them off so i just told it that the questions it's asking i already thought it had

362
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:24,240
the answer could you just give me the recommendation it just saves me a lot more time than actually

363
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:30,960
engaging in the q and a and so it wrote these recommendations so the minimum viable event loop

364
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:37,440
after 2.1 becomes this idea of create a basic event loop and there's no tooling no streaming

365
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:43,440
there's just the fact that it can receive messages from the sdk at the moment at the end of epic one

366
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:48,720
we're just doing http requests but it thinks that it might be useful to put in some socket

367
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:54,240
functionality at that point it now feels that the event loop that we're building is a bunch

368
00:35:54,240 --> 00:36:00,240
of capabilities that can be done as multiple stories and we can move the tools that we want

369
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:07,920
to do into 2.4 to 2.6 and when i look at that i realize that even before we move on to epic three

370
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:13,520
if i want to build in other capabilities like clawed skills this epic will be the right way

371
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:18,880
to go because it's designed in such a way that each cross-cutting concern or aspect

372
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:24,400
can be added one at a time later on if needed so it's already figured out a much better plan

373
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:29,040
but remember that the initial part of this conversation was can you create the instruction

374
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:34,640
for me so i just tell it down the bottom here and i'll press enter that this is perfect i love the

375
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:40,160
way it's thinking what it needs to do is now create those instructions that we want to put

376
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:45,920
back into the top conversation and just so you know that top conversation is this one that's

377
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:51,360
here we're going to take whatever comes out of this conversation and drop it straight into here

378
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:56,800
to modify it so here's our detailed instruction set we can just go all the way to the bottom

379
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:04,320
with this we'll make a copy of it come up here and paste it in 203 lines of information just

380
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:10,240
by asking a couple questions so it's already started working on things one of the interesting

381
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:15,200
things is it's also playing around with the product requirements document right here so the

382
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:22,560
changes we asked for have been implemented we've got a change to story 1.4 and we've got a whole

383
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:29,840
new re reordering and breaking up of epic 2 and what the number of stories really tell us is how

384
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:34,080
many development sessions are going to go on because we'll get the scrum master and the

385
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:39,440
developer to work on each of the stories sequentially starting from one and going through to number 14

386
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:46,480
so quickly looking at the prd we've got the new epic list it's the mono repo set up the agents

387
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:51,440
or the server in the back end and the front end client and then we've got all the details coming

388
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:56,960
through one story at a time these are just simple stories they'll be converted into full-blown

389
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:02,720
stories with the scrum master and then add streaming and logging as we go and then after

390
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:08,480
that we can do the tools and then finally connect it all up to the react front end so with the very

391
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:15,200
complete epic list in place we'll come back to our conversation and just move on to the next step

392
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:21,200
which is the checklist so what the checklist has done is just read the prd now this is from a

393
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:27,680
product owner or product manager's point of view so this is all the business cases have been covered

394
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:32,400
we haven't yet gone to the tech stack or the software architect's point of view that's the

395
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:38,560
next area but when we look at it it says it's 92 complete there's problems with it but it's

396
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:44,800
mentioned that the user research area isn't really that relevant for a demonstration like this so i

397
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:51,360
won't worry about it and so everything else has passed except for this area in the mvp so any

398
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:56,640
blockers to moving forward well there's none identified are there any high level issues that

399
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:02,560
we should be aware of i think this is one we might address but we'll do it asking a recommendation

400
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:07,920
rather than actually taking the time to define it because the ai will probably do a better job

401
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:13,680
than me at coming up with an answer anyway these medium level issues don't really matter to me

402
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:18,320
like the target user doesn't matter and the success metrics don't matter in this particular

403
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,640
project now my background has been software engineering software architecture and even

404
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:28,880
for a time a scrum master so these numbers that you're seeing here the 23 days to get this

405
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:34,800
application written are legitimate numbers this is about how long it would take to do a project

406
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:40,080
like this if you were doing it in an enterprise system but at the end of the video i'll tell you

407
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:44,880
how long it's taken to do the documentation and to do the coding so we'll see what numbers really

408
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:52,480
come back so i've just dictated a little statement about the outer scope area like what does it

409
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:57,200
suggest we put in there and i've also said that for the logging i don't want to use a logging

410
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:02,720
framework but i wouldn't mind some simplistic patterns predefined before we get started and

411
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:08,880
this is perfect this is just what i didn't want to actually type in myself so we're not going to use

412
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:13,920
database and persistent authentication authorization isn't needed it's not for

413
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:20,720
production testing infrastructure is not important in this process advanced features like quality

414
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:26,160
gate hoops all this sort of stuff was all out of scope for me it doesn't need to be a polished ui

415
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:32,560
though i hope it'll be pretty good with shad cn and tailwind css logging and monitoring is also

416
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:38,320
really good it's come up with just a simple javascript logo platform it's not trying to

417
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:43,680
use libraries or anything like that so i'm just asking it to update the prd with all the changes

418
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:51,200
the only little change i mentioned is that the hot module reloading which is a developer experience

419
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:56,640
changes like modifying a bit of code and seeing it updated directly in the client is a really

420
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:02,800
nice capability to have in the application so we're all complete with our prd at this point

421
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,760
it's suggesting that we hand off to the architect we could do it in this conversation

422
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:15,040
but what we'll do is we'll just exit out of clawed and and start a new clawed session because we

423
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:19,920
want to have a clean context to get up and running with the architecture now i just want to point out

424
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:25,600
some basic maintenance that i like to do with working with clawed so i've just put in this

425
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:32,080
little prompt here and the reason is that we've created a brief we've created a prd but my initial

426
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:38,400
system prompt or the clawed prompt is pointing to the planning phase of the system but now that

427
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:44,640
bmad method has done these great documents i want to ensure that my clawed file knows about them

428
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:52,240
and so it's taken some old ideas like the planning documents and the bmad execution guide which are

429
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:58,480
now this one's not relevant anymore and this one's just lower priority so it said we've got the brief

430
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,960
we've got the prd and then we've got the planning guide now a lot of changes have been made but if

431
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:07,600
we go down the bottom and have a look at the summary we can see that our system prompt has

432
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:13,040
a very clear understanding of everything we've done right now one of the other things i noticed

433
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:19,680
is that it knows that the next step is going to be the architecture so if we come down and we will

434
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:25,600
clear out again and start with a new clawed context we'll go straight into the architecture

435
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:31,200
agent let it load and we can move into creating things so we don't need the back end architecture

436
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:37,200
and front end individually we just need the full stack architecture so we'll just paste that in

437
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:42,560
and kick it off so the architect is going to generate our architecture at this location

438
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:48,720
in the dots folder it's read the project brief it's read the prd we have a basic introduction

439
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:54,800
and it's worked out for starter templates that while it's based on a different idea there is no

440
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:59,840
starter template so for us it's just going to put in a changelog and we can move on to the next

441
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:05,120
section which is the main architecture so it's written out a lot of information i've read through

442
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:10,640
it all it's pretty much just restating a lot of the stuff we've already got we've got a technical

443
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:16,160
summary we've got the platform and infrastructure one of the things that it notices is that for an

444
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:22,800
mvp we don't need any complexities like a platform or infrastructure service approach we've got some

445
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:28,480
interesting graph that's going to show up in our markdown document and a list of the architecture

446
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:33,600
patterns and the rationale at that point we can just move on to the next section which is building

447
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:38,240
the tech stack so it currently hasn't written the markdown documents a lot of this is a little

448
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:44,560
unreadable but we've got the full tech stack table going on and again we've got rationale summary

449
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:50,800
including the key technology choices we've got the trade-offs of not having concepts like caching

450
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:56,160
and the database we're going to use version pinning so should be recording what version it's on

451
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:02,640
like react 19 and these ideas could be important if we're using an mcp to go and get documentation

452
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:09,120
around react or express it needs to know what version to work with now if you are actually

453
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:14,080
coming from a point of view where you don't fully understand all the terminology going on remember

454
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:20,320
there are other ways that you can deal with this documentation so you can use chain of thought also

455
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:26,000
secure day sort of stuff i understand generally the technology going on so i'm just pressing one

456
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:31,840
to move forward so now it gets into the data models and this is just the transport or usage

457
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:38,400
of data in the system so the first idea of the chat interface and the fact that it might have a

458
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:44,720
id such as the user or the ai bot content and status this is all great the only thing i'm a

459
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:51,520
little concerned about is does it match with the verse cell ai chat bot got a section on the tool

460
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:56,960
calling so the reading of the json writing of the json and then just messaging between client and

461
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:03,440
server so it's only identified three different objects that we need the chat message tool call

462
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:09,920
and the socket event so with that i'm just going to move forward so we can now just move on to the

463
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:15,600
api specification the only thing i was looking at here which i thought interesting is that we

464
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:21,520
are using this bio directional communication pattern now i don't know how much i'm going to

465
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:26,880
be changing specifically on the server that i need to send back to the client because i know this was

466
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:32,080
based off a different application the storyline app that i talked about where a lot of that would

467
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:37,040
happen but i think this will work pretty cleanly so now it's just working out all the different

468
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:43,680
components where it thinks the files are going to be as it builds out the application one of the

469
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:50,480
interesting things about doing it this way is that when we go back and look at the prd we may find

470
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:56,960
out that the order of doing things which the prd will list might be in conflict with some of the

471
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:03,360
architecture decisions now in version 6 of the bmad method they deal with that with a section

472
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:08,640
called solutioning i don't think it existed in version 4 so we'll deal with that ourselves

473
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:13,920
when we get to it we can also see here that there's a big component diagram being created

474
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:17,920
that we can go and look at a bit later so it's pretty good it's come up with the idea that

475
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:23,600
there's a data directory and that's where it's going to put json documents based on the ideas

476
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:29,600
i've already told it about it's got the concept of products it's got the concept of blog posts

477
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:35,920
maybe it needs some configuration so if we needed to do a home page and it had a logo or a theme

478
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:41,520
that's where that sort of information could go it's given a sample file structure talking about

479
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:49,200
the idea that files should be in kebab case and that it's essentially just an array of json objects

480
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:54,720
though we can see with that one that that's more just a general object now there's no scheme of

481
00:46:54,720 --> 00:47:00,800
validation so this system could be brittle or fragile in the real world but i think for the

482
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:07,200
use cases we're doing it'll work pretty well and if we did want a more strict rules system we could

483
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:12,640
introduce something like zod or some sort of schema to make sure that any data being written

484
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:19,120
or read from always follows a certain format so we'll just move on to the next area one of the

485
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:25,040
things we can see here from our trade-offs is that this is not designed for big systems

486
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:29,680
it's really just a little internal tool that i want to use it for at the moment so it's come up

487
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:34,240
with a plan for our front-end components we've got the chat interface we've got some generic ui

488
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:41,200
controls we got the idea of the sockets it'll just be a single page application no router involved

489
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:48,640
and a bunch of static html pages i think the big issue we might have there is keeping style

490
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:53,760
consistency when we generate things and we haven't catered for that but we'll see how it

491
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:59,520
goes when we start running the application so plenty more examples coming through so we're

492
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:06,080
nearly done with the architecture we've just put in the system backend we've got the agents how

493
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:12,240
they're all going to work we got the tools that we need to work with a couple of utilities plenty

494
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:18,320
of example code coming through more diagrams being added to the system so we can see here

495
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:23,600
it's going to have a native npm workspace we're going to have three packages so we've got the

496
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:28,960
server client and the shared types going on now the full workflow from the command line has been

497
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:36,720
listed like node npm we've got the clawed auth this will allow us to hook up our agent sdk to our

498
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:42,720
local clawed account it plans to have a single line to get it all up and running just npm run

499
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:48,240
dev we'll start both the server and the client and now we're on to the remaining sections so

500
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:53,840
we've got the deployment strategy coming through we've got a continuous integration continuous

501
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:58,880
development pipeline but it's very empty there's nothing really going on just yet conversations

502
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:04,720
about environment we've got security coming through we've got performance metrics we've got

503
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:10,640
all the testing approaches just documented as future they're not in place just yet but we do

504
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:15,680
have sample code of what it could look like in the future and then we've got the error handling

505
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:21,440
strategy we've got a diagram and we've got sample codes to work with now we've got a two and a half

506
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:28,480
thousand line document created it's quite extensive if we jump over to vs code and look at it we can

507
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:34,000
see it's got concepts like the high level architecture we've got diagrams being generated

508
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:39,040
we can see that the plan is for the user to interact with the browser and for that to talk

509
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:45,120
to the agent event loop the agent event loop should then be doing any tool calling that it

510
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:51,920
needs to do and returning information back to the chat gpt stream we've got the ability to write

511
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:57,520
different files as we go a whole lot of architectural patterns we've got the defined tech stack very

512
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:03,440
extensive data models are defined and clearly written out using typescript we've got the custom

513
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:10,800
utilities which are integrated into the sdk right here then we move into components related to the

514
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:16,160
front end and how it communicates with the back end because the shape of data on both the front

515
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:21,680
and the back end can be the same we've got a shared types to transport that data and then we

516
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:27,520
get a visualization of the components on both the front end and how they communicate through to the

517
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:33,280
back end and we can see a little bit of where the shared components meet now we've got a sequence

518
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:38,880
diagram that's showing us the way data flows through the system and this is based on the

519
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:44,800
happy path meaning what happens when nothing goes wrong we've then got examples of the tool

520
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:51,360
invocation this is the writing of jason then the error handling workflow so this is the unhappy

521
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:57,200
workflow now the thing with web sockets is that they can stop working so we've got a reconnection

522
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:02,640
workflow coming through and examples of if i had the product catalog working what it would all look

523
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:08,400
like the writing of the product jason as an example then it talks about database schema well

524
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:14,160
we don't really have one but we do have a storage architecture it's just going to be files and samples

525
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:20,480
of what in this case products could look like blog posts and the configuration for the system and just

526
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:25,600
how the files are going to be laid out then it's documenting what we're not going to have so we

527
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:32,320
don't have schema validation we don't have index and performance sorted out we're not using caching

528
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:38,080
we'll just the data that we store will just be version controlled in github then we've got a

529
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:43,680
full list of what the front end architecture is going to look like followed by component templates

530
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:48,720
so when it needs to write a component it can use the component template to start there we've got

531
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:55,440
the state management architecture up on the client so this is examples of how the client can talk

532
00:51:55,440 --> 00:52:00,880
to the back end and this has all been listed through here we've got the routing organization

533
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:06,480
now remember we don't have a router this is just a single page application but we do have concepts

534
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:12,160
like dealing with static html and then we move on to the back end architecture we've got the files

535
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:18,000
that are planned to be created we've got an example template for what a controller could look like

536
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:24,080
storing of data we'll use the repository pattern but it'll be file based persistent and then we've

537
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:30,640
got authentication and authorization flows which is really just the clawed authentication

538
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:38,400
for the sdk kicking in simple little middleware guard but generally we don't have any authentication

539
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:43,520
going on and then we've got the full unified project coming through right here so with all

540
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:50,720
this information done the next thing to do is just to confirm that our prd that we've created

541
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:58,400
is actually going to match with the architecture that we've got now in version 6 of be mad method

542
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:03,680
they have a section called solutioning which takes care of that but we'll do it manually today

543
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:09,760
now i'm just going to go into the pm and we're just going to ensure that we've still got alignment

544
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:16,080
between the prd and the architecture because the prd was created before the architecture

545
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:24,400
so i've just told john the pm to check that the architecture document and the prd are in alignment

546
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:30,240
main thing i want to ensure is that the prd is still in the right order based on the architecture

547
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:36,080
i also want to see if any of the stories or the epics or anything needs to change based on what

548
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:40,560
we did with the architecture if you're using version 6 of the be mad method this is called

549
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:46,160
solutioning it's just something i tend to do manually because i found it effective in the past

550
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:52,640
so it's finished the alignment with the architecture document it's listed a bunch of areas i've read

551
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:59,120
through them all and they're very minor so i think the main thing that we can do is just apply number

552
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:06,640
one which is the recommendations to the prd can be applied right now so those minor alignment issues

553
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:12,960
are now being fixed between the prd and the architecture what we're going to do now is

554
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:19,520
change over to the po the product donor and this is because we want to shard the documents now if

555
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:26,960
i just jump down to this view here sharding is the idea of splitting up a big document into little

556
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:32,560
documents and a few of the agents can do sharding but the one that's designed to do for both

557
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:38,480
architecture and prds is the po and that's why we've jumped over to there and we can see

558
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:43,360
the command here it's called shard doc followed by the document we want to work with and the

559
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:49,040
destination that we want to put it in so we'll start by typing in shard doc and i'll put in

560
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:56,400
the at sign and type in the prd and after that we'll put it into a file that doesn't currently

561
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:01,680
exist which is why i haven't used the at sign it's docs prd now while that's doing that we'll

562
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:07,360
head over to vs code to see what's going on so it's this big document that we've got going on

563
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:13,440
here and we're moving it into this folder and you can see everything being split up and there

564
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:18,560
should be a little index that points to where all the different parts of that file exist

565
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:24,880
so with that done we go back and we run the shard doc again this time we're going to click on

566
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:30,960
architecture and if we head over we should get an architecture folder being generated and we've got

567
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:36,640
all the indexes pointing to each individual file as well now we're about to get into development

568
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:41,600
but we should have a look at what our dots look like so we have the brief that was generated

569
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:47,600
we've split the prd out into individual files we've done the same thing for the architecture

570
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:52,720
but i haven't gotten rid of those files i've moved them into an archive directory and i've

571
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:58,720
left the planning document because that's got a lot of detailed files that we can lean on if we

572
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:06,000
need to at the time of generating the stories so now we're ready to start developing our application

573
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:12,480
so to get started we need the scrub master and the scrub master will read through the epic and

574
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:18,640
create the first story for us and that can be done by using this command here called draft so what

575
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:24,400
we'll do is we'll type in draft and we could say something like draft first story in this case

576
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:31,600
so i've got draft first story from first epic and if we go over and have a look at the epics list

577
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:38,080
the first one is the mono repo set up with the basic server and client so we can see it starting

578
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:44,240
to gather architecture context here we've got all the different documents that we've created

579
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:49,920
in the architecture folder being read as needed it's ensuring for the first time that we've made

580
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:55,280
the stories directory now i've already done that manually now keep in mind that from the epic point

581
00:56:55,280 --> 00:57:01,680
of view it's only got this basic information to start with so it's drawing from that followed by

582
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:08,240
all the architecture documents and we now have our first story in draft mode and we can see that it's

583
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:14,320
grabbed from the epic the story card and the acceptance criteria and from that it's just

584
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:19,600
developed a bunch of tasks and sub tasks to work with it's aware that there's no story to start off

585
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:25,680
with this is the first one it accesses the tech stack we've got the project structure that it's

586
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:31,280
meant to be creating we understand the workspace that we're in and it's gone and prepared some

587
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:36,160
shared types so it's grabbing a lot of this information from the architecture document

588
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:41,280
setting up the naming conventions and the coding standards and it also understands how to set up

589
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:47,120
the type script configuration it's filled in an area for testing which at the moment we don't

590
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:53,440
have any testing and so at this point we could start doing development now the normal flow in

591
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:59,280
an application would be to read through this and check everything is okay for now i'm just going

592
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:06,240
to change this from draft to ready and hit save and then we can go back to clawed where we can

593
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:11,360
start doing our development now it needed to be in that ready mode so we've done that so we'll just

594
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:17,360
switch over to the development agent and we can just type develop story now i'm going to put in

595
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:23,840
the 1.1 because it'll make it easier for it to find the correct document without having to look

596
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:29,200
through documents and now it has a plan of action of what it's going to work through so it's going

597
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:36,080
to set up our package.json create the workspace directory structure for us move on to configuring

598
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:43,760
type script create the workspace package.json and create the shared types we'll do the git ignore

599
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:50,400
and then finally it will verify that the mono repo has been set up correctly so it's finished

600
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:56,240
developing all the code it makes a statement that everything is in place it's a little bit hard to

601
00:58:56,240 --> 00:59:02,640
test because we don't actually have any source code just yet but when the story has been updated

602
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:09,040
we have a lot of check boxes of the work that's been done when i personally run the build i got

603
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:14,960
a couple of errors but they're actually listed here so that's okay all the files have actually

604
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:20,560
been created so at that point we can close off this store now you might notice at the end of

605
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:28,640
the story there's an area for the QA agent so what we can do is go back over type in slash QA for the

606
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:33,920
quality assurance agent now this is not an agent i would normally use in my own projects what i

607
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:40,400
have are custom agents more for story acceptance testing and that's about generating a document

608
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:46,000
for the human to work through and test different things that would be visual in nature but for this

609
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:52,800
video we'll use the QA agent and we'll just do a review on 1.1 i mentioned that i'd normally do a

610
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:58,720
story acceptance test plan now that doesn't preclude doing normal tests as well so usually

611
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:03,760
when you're developing an application you want to have unit tests you might want to have end-to-end

612
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:10,240
tests but definitely you need some sort of a test plan at the end of the story that says these are

613
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:15,200
the things that you have to go and look at and in a more complex application i like it to actually

614
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:20,240
walk me through and say first click on this menu filling this piece of information and all of this

615
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:25,600
information can be derived from a story and if it was something i was doing with this project the

616
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:32,000
way it would look is that it would create a new file right next to the story so we've got 1.1

617
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:39,280
dot story but i would have a 1.1 dot story dash sat and in that would be all the guidance and

618
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:44,800
instructions for me to go and visually check that everything's working now currently we can see that

619
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:51,680
the qa agent has come in it started to update the document so we now have our overall quality

620
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:58,400
assessment in place everything seems to be okay and one of the interesting statements is this one

621
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:03,600
right here so it's just talking about future considerations that'll be important with new

622
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:10,400
stories now if we go back to our vs code we can see that the story has been updated with all this

623
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:16,640
extra quality assurance checks so with our first story down we'll do a commit and we can see that

624
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:24,480
there's all the new configuration and setup for the mono repo plus there's all the architecture prd

625
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:31,280
and the initial story has been added as well we'll set up a new claw code and the first thing we need

626
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:38,080
to do is make sure we're on the scrum master and we'll type in draft story 1.2 and let it go and

627
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:44,000
build that new document for us now like before it goes through a template loads in information from

628
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:51,200
the epic that we're on story 1.2 loads in all the technical architecture documents also reads from

629
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:59,120
the previous story so it knows what's already been done so story 1.2 has been drafted i just had a

630
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:04,640
quick look through the document so i've set the status to ready but we've got our acceptance

631
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:11,040
criteria we've got all of our subtasks in place so now it's time to develop we just go back i've

632
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:18,320
already set up the development agent and we'll just type in develop story 1.2 and let it run

633
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:24,400
now while that's running i'll just talk about the idea of working with multiple projects at once

634
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:30,240
one of the things i love about being mad is that if you are generating two different applications

635
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:35,280
you've got a fair bit of time while the development is going on so you saw what i

636
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:41,040
did i set up the story then i switched over to the developer agent and i kicked it off

637
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:46,160
at that point i'll go to another terminal where i've already got the mad running on a different

638
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:51,680
project and goes through the same process now personally i can't do three projects at a time

639
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:57,520
because usually the first project has finished and i've got to go back and manually review it

640
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:02,560
but the good thing is that you can be working on two different applications at the same time

641
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:08,400
so we'll just come back and have a look at what it's doing and we can see that as it goes it's

642
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:14,240
signing off on tasks that it's done and it just keeps working through them so it's finished the

643
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:20,400
development the definition of done has been filled in we got some new files what we'll do is we'll

644
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:26,960
jump over to the quality assurance agent so again we're going through a number of code quality

645
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:33,920
metrics and we can see a list of the changes that wherever it says this story and we can go and have

646
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:38,800
a look at the code over here now if you're a developer this is an area that you probably

647
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:45,520
spend a lot of time looking i work more as a software architect and so while it would be smart

648
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:51,040
for me to check all the code i usually don't check the code and that's an interesting thing about this

649
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:57,280
i've built complete enterprise applications and i spend more time working on the documentation

650
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:03,920
to check the code quality than i do in actually looking at the code now the agents i use for that

651
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:09,200
i'll talk about in future videos at the moment we're just trying to build a simple application

652
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:14,880
so all the completion notes have been filled in we know the files that have been changed and now

653
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:22,720
the qa has come in so if we go and open up qa and look at the quality gate number 1.2 we can see

654
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:29,520
a yaml file on the changes though it's a lot easier to see it back in the clawed context window now at

655
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:36,640
this point we could be moving on to 1.3 but i suspect there might be something in this code

656
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:42,800
that we could test that we can see if it's working but the problem is that we don't have a list that

657
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:49,360
we can check so i've gone and set myself up a new window this is a conversation i have with a second

658
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:54,480
brain and the second brain has knowledge about things like be mad version 4 and version 6 and

659
01:04:54,480 --> 01:05:01,680
i've had it just construct for me instructions for creating a story acceptance testing agent

660
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:07,520
now i'll just point out behind the scenes what's really going on is that if we do a tree you can

661
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:13,440
see all the different documents that i've got available on clawed so we've got the sdk here

662
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:18,960
we've got clawed code we've got skills and you can also see stuff on be mad method we've got

663
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:25,440
mostly v4 but we've also got information on v6 as well and it's true having access to that information

664
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:30,640
plus the project we're working on that we've been able to build these instructions so what i'm going

665
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:37,760
to do is just take all the information down to the bottom and we'll just go into our current

666
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:45,040
conversation and say can you create a new agent for me within the be mad system i'm going to paste

667
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:50,720
the information in so that's coming through and we'll paste all that information and let it go

668
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:58,560
now if this was version 6 of be mad you would have access to a system called bmb which is the

669
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:04,240
be mad module builder and if we go back to our second brain you can see where i've gone that

670
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:11,120
information there is this bmb folder that allows you to create agents for different workflow modules

671
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:17,760
but because we're in v4 we don't have access to that module and so i've just let it come through

672
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:22,720
so what i'm going to do is select the command we've got i've copied it into the clipboard

673
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:30,960
and it says that if we run it we should see some blue time stamp iso 8601 format so what we'll do

674
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:38,080
is we'll jump over to a terminal we'll paste it in and see what happens when we run it and yep

675
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:44,080
certainly does we've got some line console items here so the good thing is we can see what the

676
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:49,520
application is meant to do based on what the story says it should do now this is a little bit

677
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:55,520
different to a user acceptance test because this will change from story to story something that

678
01:06:55,520 --> 01:07:03,120
would have been a uat in say 1.1 might now be defunct and not useful in 1.3 so it's not quite

679
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:09,280
the same as a uat which is generally for the life of the application this is only for the life of

680
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:16,240
the story so now we'll come down to ac4 this is about checking the health of the server apparently

681
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:23,440
if we hit the api health endpoint we should get a status okay so i'm just coming up to a terminal

682
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:30,240
and we'll run it and yes it's saying status okay so that's just a quick demonstration on how you

683
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:35,760
can create your own agents at any time it's easy to just say model it after something give it a

684
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:41,680
little bit of instructions on what to do one of the things i find with that particular agent that

685
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:48,160
i did is that some of those commands like was the terminal blue is not something i need to

686
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:54,240
visually check but i could get the ai to do it so i tend to split it up into two groups those that

687
01:07:54,240 --> 01:08:00,480
i have to go and check out myself like entering in a form did i see an error message versus the

688
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:06,160
ones that could just be tested by clod code itself but hang on you might be saying what about play

689
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:12,400
riot or end-to-end tests could you set them up and the answer is yes you can you probably should

690
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:18,080
but i find that they're quite hard to get going they're very fragile so they're always breaking

691
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:24,000
and you spend more time wasted around in debugging them where then all you really want in this

692
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:29,200
particular case is do the forms work the way the story said they were going to be implemented

693
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:35,440
and i need to test it visually anyway i can't purely rely on e2e testing and this is where

694
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:42,080
the sat agent is really good so at that point i've just come back to clod code and what we're

695
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:48,400
going to do is just do a commit and push this up so what i've done is started a new clod code

696
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:55,120
we've gone over to the scrum master we started drafting story 1.3 so it's finished creating the

697
01:08:55,120 --> 01:09:01,280
story let's head over to visual studio i've already set it to ready i think after it gets

698
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:06,000
through the tasks the main thing that we're going to want to look at is the fact that there's now a

699
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:11,040
html page so we should be able to see something apparently there's going to be a little bit of

700
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:16,960
javascript going on so let's go back and start developing so i'm just letting it load up the

701
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:23,680
developer and once that's done we can just develop the story 1.3 so now the development is finished

702
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:30,640
it looks like we're going to have an index file that we can go and look at or do the sat soon but

703
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:37,600
let's just go over to the qa bot for a moment and we'll run our review on 1.3 while that's running

704
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:43,040
we'll just do a quick check of the document it says all the tasks done there should be a public

705
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:49,680
directory we've got the html index we've got script tags coming through in a moment we should

706
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:57,040
see an update to the qa results so the qa results are in we've got a new gait file we can see the

707
01:09:57,040 --> 01:10:04,400
story we will check an sat soon there's updates to the packages the client application now has an

708
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:11,840
index html page going on so let's go and test our story except in a spot we should be able to type

709
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:21,520
in sat and we've got sat so currently taylor is loading into memory we've got a create sat command

710
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:28,720
available we've also got an update sat command now we'll kick off the create and this command

711
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:34,000
this one here that we haven't used yet is just in case i don't like the instructions that the

712
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:41,680
current bot has we've got the ability to update the bot so this is reading our sat is reading the

713
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:47,040
story that's going to be the source of truth it's also looking at some of the code that's been

714
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:53,520
created like the client index html and at the end of this we should have a new file just sitting

715
01:10:53,520 --> 01:11:00,960
next to 1.3 story so it's just created it let's pop it open so the story itself was about creating

716
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:07,840
a basic html page and the human test that we can do requires us to run the server which i've just

717
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:12,720
done and then it wants to go to the chat window and we should see a blue header called client

718
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:18,640
server communication test let's just bring it up that looks like it and it's also got a text input

719
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:25,840
box saying enter a message optional yep that's in place and a blue button labeled test health endpoint

720
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:33,760
it's also saying gray response area with test response will go here i wonder if it works now

721
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:39,120
we'll come back to having a look at our form we've got some things around styling i'm not that concerned

722
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:46,240
about that what's this form submission without a page reload should just say server response status

723
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:53,760
is okay and apparently there's no page reload so we'll bring up our website and we'll click on test

724
01:11:53,760 --> 01:12:00,800
endpoint and there wasn't a refresh but we did see the server response update there's a bonus

725
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:08,400
visual test we can stop the server which i've just done and if we click on test health endpoint we get

726
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:14,400
failed to fetch make sure the server is running so that's really cool i wasn't planning to create

727
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:20,720
the sat agent as part of this video but this is the idea of it is that you don't have to think

728
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:27,040
about what the code did it tells you what has happened and tells you how to reproduce it which

729
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:32,640
just saves you a heap of time when you're using the beam add method to develop an application we'll

730
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:38,960
come back to our terminal where i was running that server and we'll just clean up after ourselves so

731
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:44,640
we'll do a bit of a commit right now and we've got a great commit message everything's listed

732
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:51,680
so for story 1.4 i've just run everything at once i haven't done any testing yet we started off with

733
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:58,240
bob the scrum master he created the story i went a little bit premature into taylor for the story

734
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:03,840
acceptance test because that can be derived from the story but it should also be done after

735
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:10,880
the development so i needed to do a bit of an update later i also ran james to develop all

736
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:17,040
the code and then did quinn to do the quality assurance so the new documentation files are

737
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:25,120
that we have a story we have an sat and we have a q and a document and from a code point of view

738
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:30,880
we got new files plus a little bit of an update to the readme so we can see the end points that

739
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:38,000
we want to test but if we go and look at the sat plan we've got a little bit of console logging

740
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:45,200
that we should see in chat and we should see some server responses if we type anything into

741
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:51,840
the chat window apparently it can also handle a disconnection so let's go test them out so here's

742
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:58,720
our web application will hit refresh and it's saying that we're currently connected let's just

743
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:05,760
say appy dave here press enter and we're getting a response received i've just asked it to kill

744
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:11,440
the server over in clawed code because i think it's running in the background over here i didn't

745
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:17,840
actually start it and look at that it's starting to say that it's disconnected what i'll do is

746
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:23,920
restart it from the terminal myself and if we come back to our web application hopefully it just

747
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:30,240
automatically reconnects so at this point we're right at the very end of the epic so number one

748
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:36,960
is done we've done stories one two three and four from the epic now at this point we might want to

749
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:43,360
do a retrospective this is something that you would do in agile development i recently talked

750
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:50,880
about that in a video so this video here how to make your ai coding partner smarter was an ai

751
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:57,760
retrospective that i did a few months ago on be mad this has now been implemented into be mad so

752
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:02,400
you'll see that in the version 6 once that's available otherwise you can watch this video

753
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:08,880
to see how it works but for now we will just move straight on to epic number two so at this point

754
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:15,760
we have finished our first feature our first epic in the system we have this client and server

755
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:22,320
application it uses socket io and has bio directional communication meaning that we can

756
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:28,480
type something in the text box and it immediately hits the server or if the server was to want to

757
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:33,760
communicate with the client it could do that as well now all the code and prompt sequences are

758
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:39,200
available up on the github repo if you want to access that there's a link to my community down

759
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:45,280
below now next up we're going to work on epic 2 which is the clawed agent sdk and what that's

760
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:51,760
going to allow us to do is put the equivalent of clawed code into our server so all the sorts of

761
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:58,000
stuff you've seen me doing with be mad which is creating code writing documents doing research

762
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:04,320
hopefully we can do that from our own application so that we can build html pages and we can generate

763
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:10,240
product and blog post content so we'll head back to clawed code and we've got our scrum master

764
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:17,360
set up and we're going to draft story 2.1 and so we have our story created it's as a developer

765
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:23,120
i want a clawed agent sdk installed and authenticated so that i can integrate the

766
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:30,000
agent-driven conversational capabilities into the application now we'll do one extra step this time

767
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:35,360
and we're going to go over to the product owner agent and with this we're going to run this

768
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:42,800
validate story draft 2.1 and what that'll do is run a validation on the story that we've

769
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:48,640
already done and what it's really attempting to do here and this is an optional task is just

770
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:55,040
ensure that there were no hallucinations or mistakes made in generating the story now i

771
01:16:55,040 --> 01:17:01,680
don't normally do the validation system because it slows down my general workflow but sometimes

772
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:07,040
what you notice is that code goes off the rails and if you'd have done the validation you would

773
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:12,240
have saved yourself a lot of headaches so let's have a look at what the validation system is trying

774
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:18,800
to do so firstly it's an anti-hallucination protection is going on what it does is a qa

775
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:24,800
against just inventing stuff then what it does is make sure that all the documentation it needs

776
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:30,480
is internally stored within that story and then finally a whole lot of checks and balances on the

777
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:36,960
template and the sequence of the story so use the product owner agents validate story with

778
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:42,160
discretion like when you think something's complex because this will save a lot of future headache

779
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:47,920
if things go off the rails during the development cycle now so far we've gone through a full epic

780
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:53,040
without any issues so i didn't really need to do it but i thought i'd just throw it in so you can

781
01:17:53,040 --> 01:18:00,080
see what it does so after that we go into developing the 2.1 task and everything was going really well

782
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:05,680
created all the code that we needed ran the definition of done checklist and this is when

783
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:11,520
a bunch of warnings popped up so you can see here that there's an external dependency that we need

784
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:17,520
which is to authenticate into Claude so we'll just open up a new terminal window and we'll paste

785
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:23,520
that in and see what happens so i ran into a couple of problems doing authentication and

786
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:27,760
apparently i was on the wrong version of Claude so what i've done is an update and i'm going to

787
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:35,360
take you through the workflow as it stands i've just logged into 2.0.42 and i'm just going to do

788
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:41,040
a log out so this ensures that we are now out of Claude and down below i've created a little test

789
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:47,520
SDK script and we're seeing an SDK test fail because we're not logged in so what we'll do is

790
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:54,000
we'll come back up here and we'll run the login function and we'll say yes and yes we're using

791
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:59,280
our browser subscription so we can just come up and click on the authorize button we'll come back

792
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:05,360
to the terminal it says we're signed in so let's clear this and try it again and it's just going

793
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:11,440
to say hello in exactly five words and hopefully it gets something back and so now we can see that

794
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:19,520
our SDK is actually working so at the moment the 2.1 story is finished if we go and look at the main

795
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:25,840
story acceptance test that we need to look for it's just that we've got colored timestamp with the

796
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:32,960
agent SDK running successfully if we go down to our terminal we can see that entry just here

797
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:38,960
so from a terminal point of view the server seems to be working all of our acceptance tests have

798
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:44,560
worked and the little test tool that was created is also returning valid data that the authentication

799
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:51,360
is working now for story 2.2 the basic agent event loop i've run this ahead of time as i said we'll

800
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:57,840
go straight into testing it so here we can put in a message i'm going to say can you help me with

801
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:05,040
the Claude SDK we'll press send to agent and you'll see a message coming through here and

802
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:11,440
currently it's saying processing and we've got this great formatted HTML response i'd be happy

803
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:19,040
to help you with the SDK however i need to clarify that i'm a HTML application building bot

804
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:24,160
and the messaging that's here happens to be because of a system prompt that was created

805
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:29,760
in the last story so let's go and check out the flow that we did in conversation and you can see

806
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:36,720
that we started off with the scrum master and we just asked bob to draft story 2.2 and with the

807
01:20:36,720 --> 01:20:42,720
story created we can see that it's about doing the minimal event loop for communicating with the SDK

808
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:48,800
and we can already see from the success criteria that we were able to send a message see it logged

809
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:54,080
and then see it displayed in HTML now the main file created will be the agent event loop and

810
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:59,440
we've got this solid readiness score and we've also got a list of things that the developer could do

811
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:05,200
but we'll notice at the bottom that it does suggest that we could use a validation we don't

812
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:11,040
really have to with this sort of story but i've run one so we look at Sarah the technical product

813
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:17,200
owner we can then validate the next story now it's just comparing the story to other documents

814
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:22,880
in the system previous documents goals making sure that everything's in alignment everything's

815
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:28,240
great there's one little yellow flag here so we'll go have a look at it there's a slight

816
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:34,160
little question here but we won't worry about it in the story or rectifying it because the development

817
01:21:34,160 --> 01:21:40,000
agent will figure this out pretty easily and so next we just install the dev agent which is

818
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:47,120
james and then we can just run the develop story command as james gets all the work done it's all

819
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:53,280
being marked off on the task list the story document is being filled in along the way and

820
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:58,400
we're seeing a little bit of a state change in the document just making sure that it's now ready

821
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:05,280
for review we see confirmation of what was either created or modified and so with the code complete

822
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:11,520
i just now need a plan of action written up for me so the story acceptance test is what will kick

823
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:19,040
off this is that new agent we created we've loaded it up taylor is in place and we just run the create

824
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:25,840
story acceptance test for 2.2 so new document is created and that helps us understanding things

825
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:30,720
like what are the new files or the modifications going on if we want to go and have a look at the

826
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:37,360
code a write-up of what the code is plus a little bit of key implementation details just to help

827
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:42,000
just so that you can understand it a little bit easier so we'll go and have a look at that document

828
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:48,320
we've got the acceptance test guide with the prerequisites how to set it up and then we go

829
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:53,840
straight into the human tests and we started all of this off by running this particular test where

830
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:59,200
we saw the information coming through we saw the log messages coming through now you got to see the

831
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:04,480
happy path if we put in hello can you help me we'd get some sort of clean response coming back from

832
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:12,800
the agent sdk so what i did for the acceptance test 8 happy path is i pasted in the console log

833
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:19,200
with a little bit of a message saying that i don't see anything suggesting that this actually got all

834
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:25,280
the way through it said that i probably need to do a hard reset on the html so i did that and i

835
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:30,960
started getting a response this was very good except what i was seeing was object object all

836
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:36,960
the way through the response so i just asked it was it expecting that that was all we were going

837
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:41,200
to get because i didn't go in thorough enough reading the story to know whether i was going

838
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:46,480
to get clean data it said no it's not right so when it made some modifications to the code

839
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:51,680
it first started by suggesting what those modifications were and then it made the changes

840
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:56,640
automatically and that brings us to where we are at the moment where we can now put in a message

841
01:23:56,640 --> 01:24:02,000
we'll say what do you think would be a good application to build with the clawed sdk and

842
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:06,720
we've got a conversation stream that makes a whole lot of sense and remember that this agent

843
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:13,040
is paired with a system prompt which is about building web applications so we clean up the

844
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:19,680
end of the story by just using the qa agent which is quin and we ran the review story to build this

845
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:25,760
quality gait document so we have this audit trail of things that have happened including that the

846
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:31,520
initial implementation did have a failure in it now i've just implemented 2.3 which is real-time

847
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:37,200
streaming and one of the interesting things is i was also able to create a beam add workflow

848
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:43,040
to do all the work for me in one sequential flow we'll look at that in a moment but for now let's

849
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:49,040
just test it out so i've created a bunch of testing prompts that we can work with the idea

850
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:54,640
is that i want to see chunks come through the system so we go and select this particular one

851
01:24:54,640 --> 01:25:00,000
and come back to our web form now i've made a minor change to the system prompt so that it

852
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:05,280
has a command called test what i want it to do is ignore the idea that it's a web application

853
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:11,440
building agent and we'll just paste this information in and it's starting to write some information

854
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:18,240
you can see here it's saying processing at the moment and all of this has been done in one chunk

855
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:24,480
so the interesting thing about the Claude Agent SDK is that you can't stream word by word it is

856
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:30,160
done in chunks so it's a little bit slow between updates but you can see that the streaming is

857
01:25:30,160 --> 01:25:35,120
working between where my initial message came through and then the agent got involved we'll

858
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:41,440
try a different version where we're testing of reading the package.json we've got i'll help you

859
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:48,960
read the package.json so we see chunk zero coming through right here and now it'll do an analysis

860
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:54,960
md and we can see the three chunks coming through over in the console log so the last test is what

861
01:25:54,960 --> 01:26:01,440
would happen if we bombarded it with ideas so i'm going to put in number 10 and we'll press enter

862
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:07,120
then we'll paste and we'll put 20 and we'll paste and we'll put 100 and then we'll paste and we'll

863
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:13,760
do 10 again and we can see that counting to 10 this is what it's come up with count 20 it's done

864
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:19,280
that for us count to 20 and notice things are starting to get a little bit out of order so it's

865
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:25,840
basically as the information comes in is when it's written to the stream and what i notice about this

866
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:31,520
is that it works very much similar to how Claude code would work which is different to ChatGPT

867
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:36,800
where you actually have to wait for each response to come through now i don't personally know whether

868
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:43,520
the way with Claude code if i was to rapid fire prompts like this they kind of get aggregated

869
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:49,040
you can put in an idea and then follow it up with a change of idea and it takes it into account

870
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:54,560
don't think that's happening here but we've got the rudimentary ideas of what you can already do

871
01:26:54,560 --> 01:27:00,560
with Claude code all working now let's get back to the workflow because i created a custom workflow

872
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:06,240
to build all this out so that it could just run without too much input from me and it's called

873
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:12,480
the AppyDave workflow what it does is it starts off by asking a question what story do you want

874
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:18,560
to have so we did 2.3 at that point it started creating the story and it did that by starting

875
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:25,600
up the scrum master and running the draft story command and as per normal we got a detailed story

876
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:32,160
written it's in draft format at the moment and it's as a developer i want to stream responses

877
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:36,640
so that the end users can see information progressively now we've seen that working

878
01:27:36,640 --> 01:27:42,400
so we know it's all going on it wrote the initial plan of what the code should look like in the

879
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:49,600
story and then it gave me this status update so we can see that it's in draft acceptance criteria

880
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:54,880
is there and it's got a couple of questions do i want to continue do i want to skip or exit so

881
01:27:54,880 --> 01:28:01,040
we got a final summary of the creation of the story we can see that it's in draft mode at the

882
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:06,240
moment and it's asked me do i want to continue on the validation or skip now i said that the

883
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:12,640
validation is optional but i decided to just press continue and we can see that it's now going into

884
01:28:12,640 --> 01:28:19,520
to the product owner and validating the information in the story against other documents now we're

885
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:25,440
onto story 2.4 which is all about reading the json document and you can see that i've done

886
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:31,920
a basic test here we can see the conversation finding information on the computer it's got

887
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:37,840
three sample products in place and if we jump down to the conversation it started as usual with the

888
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:43,920
new abby dave workflow we've got 2.4 being the story that we want to run it created that story

889
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:50,960
and then i just typed in continue this moved on to validating the file that gave a 9.5 out of 10

890
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:55,840
and the little issues that were there were all dealt with pretty cleanly during the development

891
01:28:55,840 --> 01:29:01,360
phase so we didn't need to do anything once i then set the status to develop we were able to come

892
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:07,360
in and click on the develop story it also set up some sample data automatically so we had some

893
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:13,520
test products in place we also have broken data which we haven't done a test test on just yet

894
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:20,000
next it built the story acceptance test based off the story and the code that we've developed it

895
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:26,400
also ran for me all the automated tests that it could do anything that was to do with the terminal

896
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:32,160
or something that could be run from a command now during the sat generation it also generated a

897
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:37,920
couple of files that were very unexpected there was this human test there was also a quit test

898
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:44,560
so what i had to do was let it know that the sat agent that we had created earlier in this project

899
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:51,200
probably has some flaws and if it could go through and rectify them at the same time as cleaning up

900
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:56,080
these files and putting them in the correct location and this is the sort of bespoke issue

901
01:29:56,080 --> 01:30:01,200
that you can get from time to time as soon as you see something out of the ordinary with the bmad

902
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:06,720
method it's important that you probably fix it in the moment and let the system know either through

903
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:12,480
learning documents or you clawed md or in this case an agent's file that it's not quite right can

904
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:19,840
it go and update itself so we can see right here that the create sat task has been updated with new

905
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:26,560
instructions and the cleanup of unnecessary files has happened right here now when i went to read

906
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:32,960
the json using the ai agent there were a couple of problems that needed to use the development

907
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:38,720
agent to fix the first one was a little permission issue it rectified that really quickly based off

908
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:44,560
documentation then there was the rom folder it got that fixed up as soon as i gave it an example

909
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:50,240
of where it was trying to read and where the files actually were and then lastly which was the hardest

910
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:56,480
one was that we were implementing this concept of read json but it didn't have any ability to

911
01:30:56,480 --> 01:31:02,160
figure out what json documents were available or to discover the one you actually wanted so it

912
01:31:02,160 --> 01:31:08,400
suggested and then quickly built two extra tools the list would show any files that were available

913
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:13,120
and the preview would let the agent interrogate the files to figure out which one you actually

914
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:19,280
wanted so let's go and test the read system we've got our little products document and we've also

915
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:25,520
got a broken document and we'll just head over to our site and we'll say can you get me a list of

916
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:30,720
products we'll send that to the agent it's processing at the moment i'll help you get a

917
01:31:30,720 --> 01:31:36,480
list of products first let's discover them i've found some products let me read them and it's

918
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:40,960
got the file and look at that it's got the api dave on school so it's got that file that

919
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:46,960
we just updated and we'll see if this test against the broken json document will work we'll say can

920
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:53,440
you get a list of items from broken and it's doing some processing at the moment it's found that we

921
01:31:53,440 --> 01:32:00,320
have a broken dot json document let's read it and this is perfect it's giving a nice message that

922
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:06,640
the data is malformed and the system is not falling over just finished story 2.5 which is

923
01:32:06,640 --> 01:32:13,280
the ability to write information to the different data files i've done a few use cases but let's

924
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:19,120
go through the individual changes that have happened so from the api dave workflow point of

925
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:25,200
view there's a little bit of an improvement because on load it has a look through to see what the last

926
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:30,960
story was that was done and suggest the next story to go and write so i've just put in 2.5

927
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:36,400
here so it's created the story really quickly but the challenge i had with the last story

928
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:42,000
was that we added a couple of new tools that was the lists and and the preview json and so what i

929
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:48,400
did at the time of validation which is the next thing i then gave it some extra context by talking

930
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:53,680
about the list and preview json from the previous story and also giving it a little bit of a use

931
01:32:53,680 --> 01:33:00,160
case so i was able to talk through the capabilities it could already see with adding json but then it

932
01:33:00,160 --> 01:33:06,800
went on to document a bunch of critical gaps which is exactly what we want we want it to pick up old

933
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:11,520
ideas bring them into the new story and make it available for the development so it gave me a

934
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:17,440
bunch of options i went with number one that's just fix or update the story so we're seeing new

935
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:23,120
information being added to the story and that allowed us to go into developing with the new

936
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:29,040
capabilities thought of along the way and then when it wrote the sat plan one of the things

937
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:35,360
that did automatically this timeness because i'm gradually improving agents and workflows as we go

938
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:40,800
is that it did the automated tests of the terminal commands but i did ask it to run it

939
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:46,640
lot one more time and just give me a summary of what's going on so we can see the eight tests

940
01:33:46,640 --> 01:33:51,840
that are from the terminal are all working and then it started listing eight different tests

941
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:57,520
that i as the human could go and test and the steps to work on them now the first one actually

942
01:33:57,520 --> 01:34:04,080
failed and the failure was simply that it wrote the json document out in quote marks so as a

943
01:34:04,080 --> 01:34:10,080
string so i let it know that there was an issue there quickly found and rectified that particular

944
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:15,120
problem then i ran into a new problem which didn't end up being a bug but just a gap in the

945
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:20,960
requirements and you can see the basic idea here is that i had a conversation that said add sugar

946
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:27,920
for 50 cents now i said that statement after a prior statement of looking in the products table

947
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:33,680
so i assumed contextually it would just work and the issue is that it had no conversational memory

948
01:34:33,680 --> 01:34:40,640
each time it went back to the sdk so it suggested we could either fix it or create a new story

949
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:46,880
so what i've done is added a new story to this epic called 2.7 just based directly off the

950
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:51,440
information right here so the ability to have conversational memory is something we'll do in

951
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:57,760
two stories time so let's test the idea of adding and updating files in the data folder we've got to

952
01:34:57,760 --> 01:35:02,560
test products we can see the information that's here we've got one broken file as well and we'll

953
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:08,320
come over and say can you add a product we want sugar and we want it to be 50 cents after that

954
01:35:08,320 --> 01:35:14,240
we'll go down to our use cases and we've got this create an electronics json document under the

955
01:35:14,240 --> 01:35:20,240
catalog folder so it'll be a nested file and it's saying it will do it with a laptop and a phone now

956
01:35:20,240 --> 01:35:27,280
we'll head down to our json document we can see that this is expanded to have sugar at 50 cents

957
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:33,600
looks like we've got our new file let's just drag that in we've got an electronics catalog and we've

958
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:38,800
got multiple items coming in here and they're quite detailed now let's try out a couple of

959
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:44,960
discovery commands so we'll go what json exists in the data directory let's see what comes through

960
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:49,680
we can see the broken and the test products we don't have the catalog so it hasn't looked

961
01:35:49,680 --> 01:35:56,240
deeply but what we'll do is we'll add a category field to the test products table so click that

962
01:35:56,240 --> 01:36:02,960
center agent it's telling us it'll add a category now it's done it and if we head over to vs code

963
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:08,480
we can now see that on products we've got these categories so we've got groceries over here and

964
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:13,920
there was a couple of other interesting use cases that all worked which i didn't even think of it

965
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:20,400
just created these and the ability to create a file outside of the data directory was blocked

966
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:27,920
creating a file with circular references and the last useful example is to just add five items and

967
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:34,880
array to a new table so here we have five sites added so what we're seeing now is this really

968
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:41,600
powerful mechanism where we can read we can write we can update we can work with subdirectories of

969
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:48,000
files back on our server now these are data files next we'll be looking at how we can do html files

970
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:53,520
but the whole idea of this is more for an internal tool i wouldn't it's not the sort of tool that we

971
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:58,080
would use up on a public website where it can write to your server but if you're trying to

972
01:36:58,080 --> 01:37:03,760
build a little application for yourself and you want the ability to dynamically update data just

973
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:08,480
by talking into the microphone then this is a perfect technique that we can be using now with

974
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:15,520
story 2.6 our conversational bot is now starting to get really powerful so what we'll do is we'll

975
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:22,080
start off with a simple question and that's what html files exist in the public directory

976
01:37:22,080 --> 01:37:27,520
and you can see here it's saying that there are currently no html files in the public directory

977
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:33,840
and if we head down to vs code we can confirm that so we've got our data directory from the

978
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:39,120
last session available but in the server when we click on public there's nothing there right now

979
01:37:39,120 --> 01:37:43,760
so the full conversation for this workflow was that we started with the appy dave workflow it

980
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:50,720
figured out that it had done 2.5 and that it could move on to 2.6 and so it was able to start up the

981
01:37:50,720 --> 01:37:57,040
scrum master and create the story for us now because we'd made a lot of extensions within the

982
01:37:57,040 --> 01:38:05,200
2.4 and this 2.5 story i decided to let it know that it was modeling these two stories except

983
01:38:05,200 --> 01:38:10,800
rather than for data it was going to be for html and so while there were major differences like

984
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:16,480
the type of file and the location that they were going to be the actual tooling was pretty much

985
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:23,360
the same and so i suggested that it have a look at the 2.4 and the 2.5 before updating this story

986
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:28,720
with new capability from that it was able to notice all the critical gaps that were in place

987
01:38:28,720 --> 01:38:34,480
and come up with four separate tools to implement before that it only had one tool which was writing

988
01:38:34,480 --> 01:38:41,040
the html now to show that this was an extensive change we can see as we scroll through that

989
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:46,080
there's a lot of green and reds a lot of stuff been taken out a lot of new stuff being added

990
01:38:46,160 --> 01:38:52,640
and the public directory is the 2.6 story so then we changed over to the development agent

991
01:38:52,640 --> 01:38:57,600
everything pretty much went off without a hitch there were two different problems that i did need

992
01:38:57,600 --> 01:39:02,720
to address and you can see them here the first one was that it wasn't actually serving from the

993
01:39:02,720 --> 01:39:07,840
public directory i was able to test all the html but not from the application so that was a bit

994
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:12,400
of a problem the other problem was that when i was trying to display data that we created in

995
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:17,760
the previous story it also wasn't showing through so i did a little bit of prompt engineering just

996
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:24,080
to get the code working it was really easy to do because clodcode gave me option a b and c and i

997
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:30,080
just said let's go with a and c and it just wrote all the code that we needed so with our chat agent

998
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:36,880
set up to story 2.6 we'll just put in a simple prompt that says can you create a html page for

999
01:39:37,680 --> 01:39:42,720
and along with that question i'll just paste in a little bit of information i just copied from my

1000
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:48,080
website and we'll press enter and see what it does with that now you'll notice as it's building it

1001
01:39:48,080 --> 01:39:53,280
that we've got this concept down the bottom of pages so i've also added a little menu to the

1002
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:59,280
bottom of the chat box to show any public pages that are being created so it's just come back

1003
01:39:59,280 --> 01:40:04,960
with i'll create a page let me check i'll create it and it looks like a bunch of stuff's being

1004
01:40:04,960 --> 01:40:10,400
created and we can see this little index let's click on that and see what we get we've got abby

1005
01:40:10,400 --> 01:40:16,240
dave and this is actually a whole lot of information from my main website we'll just pop over and have

1006
01:40:16,240 --> 01:40:21,280
a look at that and we can see master ai and prompt engineering different projects and down

1007
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:26,320
the bottom different channels so if we come through and look at it here it looks like it's

1008
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:32,480
all the same information all it's done is created this little html file for us and it's put all the

1009
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:37,440
colors in there let's see if we can do something a little bit more complex and we'll do a prompt

1010
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:45,920
that says can you create a html page called cat dash dog and do it talking about a pet store that

1011
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:52,320
is about cats and dogs and let's go with the colors of brown yellow and green so we'll just

1012
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:58,160
let this prompt come through as soon as it's typed in so we'll send that through to the agent

1013
01:40:58,160 --> 01:41:04,720
and we can see all our product data down here we can see our cat dog and our html file so what

1014
01:41:04,720 --> 01:41:12,720
i think i want to do now is create a new html file we'll go with a css file as well so the prompt will

1015
01:41:12,720 --> 01:41:22,880
go can you create a html file called aitldr.h and can we create a css file to go with that can the

1016
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:30,800
colors of that css be light blue dark blue and white and can we make sure that we're displaying

1017
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:36,480
a whole lot of products can the products come from our test products and document so i'll just

1018
01:41:36,480 --> 01:41:42,800
let that prompt come through there it is and we'll press enter so there's a couple of typos in there

1019
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:48,960
but it looks like we're going to create a html file matching css file perfect now let me check

1020
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:56,080
what pages exist and while that's happening what aitldr is is one of my other channels this is a

1021
01:41:56,080 --> 01:42:02,480
faceless youtube channel where most of the focus is on youtube storytelling so we've got something

1022
01:42:02,480 --> 01:42:07,760
coming through they're not necessarily the colors we normally use but let's go and click on this

1023
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:13,840
and see what we get aitldr product catalog and this is really interesting from a few points of

1024
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:19,520
view so the actual widgets that are in the product listing abby dave on school sugar

1025
01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:26,000
this has all come through but we've even got the html links so we can get to the home page can we

1026
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:31,280
get to the cat and dog we can get to the cat and dog what about products that's taking us to where

1027
01:42:31,280 --> 01:42:36,240
we are and if we go back to the chat interface so at this point we've almost achieved everything

1028
01:42:36,240 --> 01:42:41,760
i wanted with this project it was the ability to create any sort of data we want let's go and

1029
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:48,240
test the idea of updating data can you go and add three different products about nail polish

1030
01:42:48,880 --> 01:42:55,200
let that come through and send that to the agent and what i'm hoping it'll do is it'll come up

1031
01:42:55,200 --> 01:43:00,720
with three interesting products it should be able to add it to the only file we've got which is the

1032
01:43:00,720 --> 01:43:06,320
test products i probably should go and rename that well let's just go back to this it can see

1033
01:43:06,320 --> 01:43:11,360
the file it's now apparently added things oh look at that it's showing them as well

1034
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:17,440
so we'll go and click on the aitldr page and see what that's showing okay we've got five products

1035
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:23,280
now our page hasn't updated but if i go down to visual studio we can see that three actual

1036
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:30,160
products have been added so my assumption is it's not reading from the javascript and it's

1037
01:43:30,160 --> 01:43:35,840
not it's actually been hard coded so maybe we can modify that so we're going to work with the idea

1038
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:43,600
of can we update the html of aitldr so that the products are actually just reading from that url

1039
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:49,840
so we'll send that through while that's doing its thing we can have a look at the url this is the

1040
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:56,080
data that's available to us it says that the page is working let's go and click on it and look at

1041
01:43:56,080 --> 01:44:01,600
that we've got eight products we've got three new products added so yeah we're using our chat

1042
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:07,920
interface to both create data update data delete it well we don't know whether it can delete

1043
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:14,240
and to actually modify the html so let's see if we can do one more compound idea so we'll go with

1044
01:44:14,240 --> 01:44:21,600
the idea of can it delete widgets from the test products table the json document can we also go

1045
01:44:21,600 --> 01:44:29,040
to the aitldr css and we'll start changing the colors to be a light pink blue and yellow we'll

1046
01:44:29,040 --> 01:44:34,800
send that through to the agent we should see it coming down the bottom here so currently it's

1047
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:40,640
doing a search broadly for the css files it's found them it's now going to read the full

1048
01:44:40,640 --> 01:44:46,720
content from them it's found widget abnc which it's going to remove from the json then it's

1049
01:44:46,720 --> 01:44:53,120
going to go and update the css and it looks like it's done that and what we'll do is click on

1050
01:44:53,200 --> 01:45:00,400
aitldr and look at that we got pinks blues and yellows and we've removed the three widgets

1051
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:08,240
moving on to story 2.7 which is a new story that came about because we encountered a bug

1052
01:45:08,240 --> 01:45:13,600
where if you typed in a couple of messages it didn't understand the previous messages

1053
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:19,760
so we've put it in place and what i thought we'd do is test it by maybe changing the title of this

1054
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:26,400
particular website and at the same time also change the price of just cats and we'll do that

1055
01:45:26,400 --> 01:45:32,080
in two separate messages so here's our first prompt can you change the title of the cat dog

1056
01:45:32,080 --> 01:45:39,040
website so that rather than saying cat and dog pet store it just says pet store so we'll kick that

1057
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:46,320
off and then we'll start the next prompt can you go to the cat dog website and change every product

1058
01:45:46,400 --> 01:45:53,680
that is related to a cat so that it is 100 more and we'll just press enter on that one now if

1059
01:45:53,680 --> 01:45:59,200
we look at the current website it says cat and dog pet store now i've done a refresh on it and

1060
01:45:59,200 --> 01:46:07,200
we can see that the pet store has been updated we want to see if the 24.99 becomes 124.99 and

1061
01:46:07,200 --> 01:46:13,920
they have changed so there's the new value and we've got the old value as 24.99 and cat and dog pet

1062
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:19,760
store so from a conversational point of view it was pretty much the standard workflow we started

1063
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:26,960
off with the appy dave workflow we created the 2.7 story we validated it the minor change here was

1064
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:33,360
that i asked it to go and read the documentation around the sdk and we have a second brain of

1065
01:46:33,360 --> 01:46:40,240
information around that particular tool the basic findings from that were all listed and updated the

1066
01:46:40,240 --> 01:46:46,160
story we then just did our standard development phase we did an sat there was nothing in there

1067
01:46:46,160 --> 01:46:52,480
other than to run the two commands that i did and so we just finish off with a review from the qa

1068
01:46:52,480 --> 01:46:59,520
agent so that brings us to the end of epic 2 and what we can now do is we can add products or any

1069
01:46:59,520 --> 01:47:06,160
sort of data that we like we can update it we can also play around with html css javascript and we

1070
01:47:06,160 --> 01:47:11,440
could call this a complete application but if we look at what epic number three is going to be

1071
01:47:11,440 --> 01:47:17,760
about we'll be able to give the chat interface a much needed upgrade and we'll do that by going

1072
01:47:17,760 --> 01:47:25,920
to react where we'll use vite shad cn tailwind css and we'll use the versel ai elements to give

1073
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:32,720
a really clean chat interface now it's a fairly simple epic we're going to initialize the react

1074
01:47:32,720 --> 01:47:40,160
application then we're going to install the shad cn and configure tailwind css then we'll build the

1075
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:46,640
chat interface again using versel ai elements and lastly we'll implement a simple dark mode light

1076
01:47:46,640 --> 01:47:53,120
mode toggle so one of the things that we have to do before we actually start the first story for

1077
01:47:53,120 --> 01:47:59,440
epic number three is we just need to do a little bit of a retrospective so i've got a basic question

1078
01:47:59,440 --> 01:48:05,200
just asking it to think about what it would need to do a retrospective and it's come up with a

1079
01:48:05,200 --> 01:48:11,600
long list of tasks that it should perform to build up that particular document i've specifically told

1080
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:18,800
it to think deeply and i've also given it as much time as it needs to do a detailed job and so it

1081
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:24,160
goes through and it writes this long document and we don't have to read the document but it will have

1082
01:48:24,160 --> 01:48:31,040
information from here that it can pull on when generating the stories for epic 3 so story 3.1

1083
01:48:31,040 --> 01:48:36,400
is finished there's not actually a lot to see there's a little bit of console logging we can

1084
01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:43,200
see now that it's using react and bite and from our front end point of view all we've got is hello

1085
01:48:43,200 --> 01:48:50,160
world be mad claude sdk and the fact that it says bite connected and we'll just check that the hot

1086
01:48:50,160 --> 01:48:58,240
module reloading is working that's working okay so we have a foundation now for the react version

1087
01:48:58,240 --> 01:49:05,760
of the chat client let's move on to story 3.2 now we are on story 3.2 and there's not a lot to be

1088
01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:13,360
seen just yet we've got an installation of shad cn and ui and if we pop it up what we'll see is

1089
01:49:13,360 --> 01:49:18,800
this user interface with the basic typing area in place we've got to click me and we've got some

1090
01:49:18,800 --> 01:49:25,360
buttons and the styling is very ordinary at the moment and according to the component verification

1091
01:49:25,360 --> 01:49:32,000
that's exactly what we want to see at the moment we've just completed story 3.3 and we're really

1092
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:38,000
close to the end of building the application and what you can see now is that it started to come

1093
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:44,080
together quite nicely we'll demonstrate where it's at in a moment but i'll point out that this is the

1094
01:49:44,080 --> 01:49:51,520
14th story that we've done and every story we've done up until this one just came across without

1095
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:58,400
a hitch it was able to be created it was validated it was written by the software developer we were

1096
01:49:58,400 --> 01:50:03,760
able to do the story acceptance testing and we were able to do the qa afterwards and everything

1097
01:50:03,760 --> 01:50:09,920
was really quite quick this is the one story where everything changed so i'll do a little bit of a

1098
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:16,240
post-mortem analysis of it as well after i've demonstrated where we're at so let's test out

1099
01:50:16,240 --> 01:50:22,640
our new chatbot and what we'll do is we'll search for products first so can you tell me what products

1100
01:50:22,640 --> 01:50:28,800
are available and we'll let this prompt come through we'll press enter and so we can see this

1101
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:35,920
little bubble coming up here that's what the user has said this is what the agent stk is responding

1102
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:42,000
with at the moment and there are our products we've got some groceries we've got some beauty

1103
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:49,200
products nail art sort of stuff so let's create a little website can you create a little html

1104
01:50:49,200 --> 01:50:57,120
website called beauty and joy can this be a nail art sort of store can we get both a html page

1105
01:50:57,120 --> 01:51:05,120
and a css file and we'll let that kick off and in a moment it'll come up with a plan of action

1106
01:51:05,120 --> 01:51:11,680
and here it's starting to happen and what we can also do is just head over to vs code where we can

1107
01:51:11,680 --> 01:51:19,600
see what we currently have we have a couple of websites here cat dog index and ai tldr and if

1108
01:51:19,600 --> 01:51:26,000
we come back and we look at these little pages here this is where we can see this and look at

1109
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:30,800
that it just created beauty and joy so maybe that's already started let's go back and see

1110
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:37,920
whether it's created here yes we can see it we've got a css file and a html file and that's why that

1111
01:51:37,920 --> 01:51:45,440
came about so let's go and click on that and see what we get okay we've got a interesting looking

1112
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:51,840
nail art shop i think we can do better styling than that so what i'll do is i'll bring it back

1113
01:51:51,920 --> 01:52:00,720
here and say can you update the css styling for the beauty and joy website and can you

1114
01:52:00,720 --> 01:52:07,920
use this basic guidelines so what we'll do is we'll just go down and paste some extra work

1115
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:14,400
and hopefully this will show up cleanly here we go we've got soft modern feminine we got some

1116
01:52:14,400 --> 01:52:21,280
primary colors coming through and it should be updating the css very soon and it looks like it's

1117
01:52:21,280 --> 01:52:27,840
finished it's actually created a different html so if we go up we now have two we have beauty and

1118
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:34,800
joy and we have beauty let's look at the old one here's the old one and the new one is looking a

1119
01:52:34,800 --> 01:52:40,720
fair bit more elegant now ideally i would have liked that to actually update the original website

1120
01:52:40,720 --> 01:52:48,880
but for a first pass add a chat bot that can create data read data and also use it for websites

1121
01:52:48,880 --> 01:52:55,520
this is working really well now i said that this story wasn't actually as successful in the coding

1122
01:52:55,520 --> 01:53:00,640
as any other story that we've done but let's have a look at what it was originally it's build a chat

1123
01:53:00,640 --> 01:53:08,000
interface with versal ai as a developer a chat interface using the ai element patterns so that

1124
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:14,400
users can send messages and have streaming agent responses now that's working and so pretty happy

1125
01:53:14,880 --> 01:53:21,680
but let's have a look at the postmortem and this is where a number of issues happen now part of

1126
01:53:21,680 --> 01:53:25,920
the issues happen because i think when i was doing it i was really tired so i wasn't paying

1127
01:53:25,920 --> 01:53:31,920
attention to different things going on but the main issue which i seem to run into every time i

1128
01:53:31,920 --> 01:53:37,120
do tailwind and totally forgot about it in this particular case is that it got configured with

1129
01:53:37,120 --> 01:53:43,600
v3 syntax but it was a version for tailwind and you might have noticed in the last story that

1130
01:53:43,600 --> 01:53:48,240
there was styling that looked pretty average and i said well that's actually how it's meant to be

1131
01:53:48,240 --> 01:53:54,160
well that's not the case and the reason is that the tailwind styling was misconfigured and took

1132
01:53:54,160 --> 01:54:00,160
a little while to find it out another issue that was happening under the hood for me is that one

1133
01:54:00,160 --> 01:54:07,120
of the servers there are two in this was meant to be running on 5173 but claude was actually running

1134
01:54:07,120 --> 01:54:14,400
a separate one on 5174 and so i was trying to see updates and nothing was coming through and i kept

1135
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:19,760
saying to claude this is not working and he kept saying i've fixed it but i wasn't seeing anything

1136
01:54:19,760 --> 01:54:25,520
visually now again a lot of that was me tired at the time but this is one of the realities of having

1137
01:54:25,520 --> 01:54:31,440
ai agents that can run the servers for you is that if they've got a conflict with your current server

1138
01:54:31,440 --> 01:54:37,600
then it's just going to spawn a new one on a different port then it had a bunch of issues

1139
01:54:37,600 --> 01:54:43,840
with the bubbles and the drop down menu that we saw going up showing up underneath the bubbles

1140
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:49,200
now the reason i actually wrote this document wasn't just so that i could show you the sort

1141
01:54:49,200 --> 01:54:54,240
of challenges that you can run into but because once you write a document like this you can make

1142
01:54:54,240 --> 01:55:00,080
it a part of your documentation system so if any other issues happen in the future and you notice

1143
01:55:00,080 --> 01:55:05,520
it you can say can you go and read other documentation or lessons learnt that were

1144
01:55:05,520 --> 01:55:12,000
done in the past and this can be a perfect way of training the ai model to you to write code the

1145
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:17,680
right way if you see a certain problem showing up again and again now we're nearly at the end

1146
01:55:17,680 --> 01:55:24,560
and about to demonstrate this system all working so the 3.4 planning document ended up getting a

1147
01:55:24,560 --> 01:55:30,720
fair few changes this became a little bit of a conversation to deal with different issues so the

1148
01:55:30,720 --> 01:55:36,880
first thing we did was we added in the light mode dark mode and that's working we've got an activity

1149
01:55:36,880 --> 01:55:43,360
slide out panel that's actually working really well clicks happen everywhere it's all using socket

1150
01:55:43,360 --> 01:55:51,680
io it had nice status checks on when files are added deleted updated when i went to use the system

1151
01:55:51,760 --> 01:55:57,200
there were a number of issues just with the system prompt so i kept feeding the conversations back

1152
01:55:57,200 --> 01:56:02,640
in and asking it to update the system prompt it now works really well and so now i've set it up

1153
01:56:02,640 --> 01:56:07,520
for four different demonstrations now there's only two in the video the first one is the little

1154
01:56:07,520 --> 01:56:12,880
example at the beginning of the video is essentially based off these prompts here and the full session

1155
01:56:12,880 --> 01:56:17,040
that we're about to demonstrate is the creation of the bookstore and we can see all the prompts

1156
01:56:17,040 --> 01:56:22,480
that we're about to run now we have our chat application created using the be mad method

1157
01:56:22,480 --> 01:56:29,520
it's got the clawed sdk as a backend some of the capabilities is that at the moment we're seeing

1158
01:56:29,520 --> 01:56:34,720
no pages but as we add pages they'll appear automatically there's also an activity log

1159
01:56:34,720 --> 01:56:40,400
showing every file coming through so if we just start off with our first creation we're going to

1160
01:56:40,400 --> 01:56:46,720
create five bookstore products we've set the prices one of them is out of stock now it's created a

1161
01:56:46,720 --> 01:56:53,280
file and automatically created products dot jason we can see five products created here next we'll

1162
01:56:53,280 --> 01:56:59,920
create a products html file now as that comes through it should automatically update this to

1163
01:56:59,920 --> 01:57:05,120
show one product at which point we'll be able to click on it and see a menu so we'll go and add a

1164
01:57:05,120 --> 01:57:10,800
few more products and if we pop up the website hopefully we're going to see it dynamically load

1165
01:57:10,800 --> 01:57:16,480
because of the socket connection which means that any updates on the server will automatically

1166
01:57:16,480 --> 01:57:22,080
come through to the client we're seeing that right there if we don't like the style we can ask for it

1167
01:57:22,080 --> 01:57:28,480
to create a product css file this is going to go with a professional blue and gold color scheme

1168
01:57:28,480 --> 01:57:35,280
now this probably won't update the html because we're only asking for it to create the css at

1169
01:57:35,280 --> 01:57:42,400
the moment and nothing has updated so we'll just say update the products html so it uses the css

1170
01:57:42,400 --> 01:57:46,720
while we're doing that we'll have a look at what it's created so we got a bunch of css created

1171
01:57:46,720 --> 01:57:54,480
right here and it's just started writing the file and a refresh is showing the blue and gold coming

1172
01:57:54,480 --> 01:57:59,600
through on the website now there's a little home page if we click on that we're going to get a

1173
01:57:59,600 --> 01:58:05,600
file not found so what we'll do is we'll come back to our chat client and put in create a html

1174
01:58:06,240 --> 01:58:12,240
file this is the index we also want to feature a few products on the front page so let's bring up

1175
01:58:12,880 --> 01:58:18,720
page and we'll click on the home see what we get and we've got a shop now and a chat with us

1176
01:58:18,720 --> 01:58:24,000
and it looks like we've got some featured products on the beginning let's go back to shop now and

1177
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:29,280
we're taken back to the products at this point it might be useful to create some blog posts so

1178
01:58:29,280 --> 01:58:34,800
we'll start with a little bit of data and we can see that it's creating it with a title author date

1179
01:58:34,800 --> 01:58:40,800
content and tags so it's very much related to the bookstore if we click on the blog post we can see

1180
01:58:40,800 --> 01:58:46,400
the information coming through here and here so we'll create a html page we're making sure

1181
01:58:46,400 --> 01:58:52,960
we're using the sockets if we bring up the page started writing the page now i think it's created

1182
01:58:52,960 --> 01:58:59,760
the blog page but when we look there's no link on the products there's no link on the home page

1183
01:58:59,760 --> 01:59:06,640
so what we'll do is we'll just jump down and put in a can you add a link on the home and the products

1184
01:59:06,720 --> 01:59:13,120
page if we click through we can read our blog articles here this looks good we'll click on

1185
01:59:13,120 --> 01:59:19,440
home we'll come back to the products and we've got the blog here as well so the three articles

1186
01:59:19,440 --> 01:59:25,040
we've got golden age of reading building your personal library and we've got philosophy in

1187
01:59:25,040 --> 01:59:33,520
pages let's go and add another blog post to the blog post jason it's in the middle of writing

1188
01:59:33,520 --> 01:59:39,600
and we have creating your home library so at that point it might be good to think about it's

1189
01:59:39,600 --> 01:59:45,040
coming up to christmas can we have a design that makes sense so we'll apply a christmas

1190
01:59:45,040 --> 01:59:52,720
styling to the product css with snowfall animation and festive red green colors it's started to come

1191
01:59:52,720 --> 01:59:58,880
through there's styling bugs and we can't currently click on the blog post if we go over to the blog

1192
01:59:58,880 --> 02:00:03,840
we can see the tinsel coming through here one thing you might notice though is that there were

1193
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:09,600
a number of attempts to get this working so we started with apply christmas styling to the

1194
02:00:09,600 --> 02:00:15,920
product css and had to follow it up with five different prompts to get it working across all

1195
02:00:15,920 --> 02:00:21,600
the different pages it had a recommendation to go with scalable vector graphics so that was the

1196
02:00:21,600 --> 02:00:27,200
recommendation we went through now since it's christmas i think we should take the sold out

1197
02:00:27,200 --> 02:00:34,000
item and do an article about promoting some of it so we'll write a blog post announcing that

1198
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:41,440
there's a special that the product has gone from 32 to 22 but there's only 10 left now the article

1199
02:00:41,440 --> 02:00:47,040
has been written but we better go and update the products so that it's in stock and we have a price

1200
02:00:47,040 --> 02:00:53,280
for it we'll click on products and this is the product that we're looking to see change and

1201
02:00:53,280 --> 02:00:57,840
there it is it's changed through it might be useful to change the color as well

1202
02:00:57,840 --> 02:01:03,600
just asking for it to be highlighted at the moment and there's our holiday special slightly

1203
02:01:03,600 --> 02:01:09,200
misaligned but we'll leave that for now and let's make sure the home page has a product for the

1204
02:01:09,200 --> 02:01:14,800
holiday special exclusive and we should be able to view it in the catalog so that brings us to

1205
02:01:14,800 --> 02:01:20,400
the end and what we've been able to do is build this complete application just with natural language

1206
02:01:20,400 --> 02:01:26,640
prompts and we did that using context engineering that's with the be mad method and the backend

1207
02:01:26,640 --> 02:01:33,840
system that we've built is using the clawed agent sdk so this is giving us all the power of clawed

1208
02:01:33,840 --> 02:01:40,080
code within our own web applications so the demonstrations we did was that we were able to

1209
02:01:40,080 --> 02:01:48,000
create html pages json documents css files make sure all the links go from page to page now all

1210
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:52,880
the code is available you can check it out in the repository and if you want to join the community

1211
02:01:52,880 --> 02:01:58,400
we have more of a discussion and teachings each day on prompt engineering now if you're loving

1212
02:01:58,400 --> 02:02:04,560
the power of be mad in the next video we're going to use be mad again but this time we're going to

1213
02:02:04,560 --> 02:02:10,560
recreate an orchestration framework just like be mad we're going to call it poem which is the prompt

1214
02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:17,760
orchestration and engineering method and the whole idea of it is so that we can create and test prompts

1215
02:02:17,760 --> 02:02:22,560
in a technique very similar to be mad i'm happy dave i'll see you in the next video
