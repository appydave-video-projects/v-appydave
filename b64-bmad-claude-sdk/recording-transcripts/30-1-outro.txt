So that brings us to the end and what we've been able to do is build this
complete application just with natural language prompts and we did that using
context engineering that's with the BMAD method and the backend system that
we've built is using the Claude agent SDK so this is giving us all the power
of Claude code within our own web applications so the demonstrations we
did was that we were able to create HTML pages, JSON documents, CSS files, make sure
all the links go from page to page. Now all the code is available you can check
it out in the repo you can check it out in the repository and if you want to
join the community we have more of a discussion and teachings each day on
prompt engineering
