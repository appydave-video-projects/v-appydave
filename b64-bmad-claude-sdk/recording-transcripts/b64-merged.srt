1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,520
Now we're nearly at the end and about to demonstrate this system all working. So

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:10,500
the 3.4 planning document ended up getting a fair few changes. This became a little

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,240
bit of a conversation to deal with different issues. So the first thing we did was

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,330
we added in the light mode, dark mode, and that's working. We've got an activity

5
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:25,920
slide out panel that's actually working really well. Clicks happen everywhere. It's

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,420
all using socket io.

7
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:32,010
It had nice status checks, some when files are added, deleted, updated.

8
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:37,500
When I went to use the system, there were a number of issues just with the system

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,570
prompt. So I kept feeding the conversations back in and asking it to update the system.

10
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,610
Prompt. It now works really well.

11
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:49,110
And so now I've set it up for four different demonstrations. Now there's only two

12
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:49,680
in the video.

13
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,550
The first one is the little example at the beginning of the video is essentially

14
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,350
based off these prompts here.

15
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,870
And the full session that we're about to demonstrate

16
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:01,230
is the creation of the bookstore. And we can see all the prompts that we're about

17
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:01,770
to run.

18
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:07,560
Now we have our chat application created using the Bmad method. It's got the clawed

19
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:13,200
SDK as a backend. Some of the capabilities is that at the moment we're seeing no

20
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,620
pages, but as we add pages, they'll appear automatically.

21
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:21,060
There's also an activity log showing every file coming through. So if we just start

22
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:26,370
off with our first creation, we're going to create five bookstore products. We've

23
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:28,890
set the prices. One of them is out of stock,

24
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:34,500
Now it's created a file and automatically created products.json, we can see five

25
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,790
products created here.

26
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:42,030
Next, we'll create a products HTML file. Now as that comes through, it should automatically

27
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,740
update this to show one product, at which point we'll be able to click on it and

28
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:47,520
see a menu.

29
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,260
So we'll go and add a few more products and if we pop up the website, hopefully we're

30
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:57,270
going to see it dynamically low because of the socket connection, which means that

31
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:01,830
any updates on the server will automatically come through to the client. We're seeing

32
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:02,640
that right there.

33
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,310
If we don't like the style, we can ask for it to create a product CSS file. This

34
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:13,200
is going to go with a professional blue and gold color scheme. Now this probably

35
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:19,320
won't update the HTML because we're only asking for it to create the CSS at the moment

36
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:24,810
and nothing has updated. So we'll just say update the products. HTML sell. It uses

37
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,470
the CSS. While we're doing that, we'll have a look at what it's created. So we've

38
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:35,070
got a bunch of CSS created right here and it's just started writing the file. And

39
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:39,180
a refresh is showing the blue and gold coming through on the website.

40
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,590
Now there's a little homepage. If we click on that, we are going to get a file not

41
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,060
found.

42
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:50,120
So what we'll do is we'll come back to our chat client and put in create a HTML file.

43
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,560
This is the index. We also wanna feature a few products on the front page.

44
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,720
So let's bring up our page and we'll click on the home, see what we get, and we've

45
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:04,550
got a shop now and a chat with us, and it looks like we've got some featured products

46
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:09,260
on the beginning. Let's go back to shop now, and we're taken back to the products.

47
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:13,340
At this point, it might be useful to create some blog posts. So we'll start with

48
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,390
a little bit of data

49
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:18,830
and we can see that it's creating it with a title, offer, date, content,

50
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:19,460
and tag.

51
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:24,050
So it's very much related to the bookstore. If we click on the blog posts, we can

52
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:26,840
see the information coming through here and here.

53
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:32,180
So we'll create a HTML page. We're making sure we're using the sockets. We bring

54
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,470
up the page

55
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,450
that started writing the page.

56
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:39,950
Now I think it's created the blog page, but when we look, there's no link on

57
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:45,350
the products. There's no link on the homepage. So what we'll do is we'll just jot

58
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,640
down and put in a,

59
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,840
Can you add a link on the home and at the products page? If we click through,

60
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:57,140
we can read our blog articles here. This looks good. We will click on home, we'll

61
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:01,620
come back to the products, and we've got the blog here as well.

62
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:06,650
So the three articles, we've got Golden Age of Reading, building your Personal Library,

63
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:13,640
and we've got philosophy in pages. Let's go and add another blog post to the blog.json.

64
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,940
It's in the middle of writing.

65
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,560
And we have creating your home library.

66
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:24,380
So at that point, it might be good to think about, it's coming up to Christmas. Can

67
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:29,750
we have a design that makes sense? So we'll apply a Christmas styling to the product

68
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,730
CSS with snow for animation,

69
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,910
and festive red green colors.

70
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:36,560
it's started to come through.

71
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,910
There's styling bugs, and we can't currently click on the blog post.

72
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:45,350
if we go over to the blog, we can see the tinsel coming through here. One thing you

73
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:49,850
might notice though, is that there were a number of attempts to get this working.

74
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:54,200
So we started with apply Christmas styling to the product CSS

75
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:59,450
and had to follow it up with five different prompts to get it working across all

76
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:00,650
the different pages.

77
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:05,870
It had a recommendation to go with scalable veto graphics. So that was the recommendation

78
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:06,770
we went through.

79
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:06,890
I.

80
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:12,620
Now since it's Christmas, I think we should take the sold out item and do an article

81
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:18,020
about promoting some of it. So we'll write a blog post announcing that there's a

82
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:24,200
special that the product has gone from $32 to $22, but there's only 10 left.

83
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,370
Now the article has been written, but we better go and update the products so that

84
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:32,750
it's in stock and we have a price for it. We'll click on products,

85
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:36,170
and this is the product that we're looking to see change.

86
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:40,670
And there it is. It's changed through. It might be useful to change the color as

87
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:41,300
well. We're

88
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,600
just asking for it to be highlighted at the moment.

89
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,100
And there's our holiday special, slightly misaligned, but we'll leave that for now.

90
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:49,640
And

91
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,370
Let's make sure the homepage has a product for the

92
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,810
holiday special exclusive, and we should be able to view it in the catalog.

93
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:01,620
So that brings us to the end. And what we've been able to do is build this complete

94
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:06,790
application just with natural language prompts. And we did that using context engineering.

95
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:12,740
That's with the BMAD method. And the back end system that we've built is using the

96
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:19,070
Claude Agent SDK. So this is giving us all the power of claude code within our own

97
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:24,580
web applications. So the demonstrations we did was that we were able to create HTML

98
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:31,070
pages, JSON documents, CSS files, make sure all the links go from page to page.

99
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,620
Now all the code is available.

100
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:36,580
you can check it out in the repository. And if you want to join the community, we

101
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:41,100
have more of a discussion and teachings each day on prompt engineering.

102
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,620
Now, if you're loving the power of BMAD in the next video, we're going to use BMAD

103
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:50,980
Again. But this time we're going to recreate an orchestration framework, just like

104
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:55,900
BMAD. We're going to call it POEM, which is the prompt orchestration and engineering

105
00:06:55,940 --> 00:07:02,140
method. And the whole idea of it is so that we can create and test prompts in a technique

106
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:06,260
very similar toBMAD. I'm AppyDave, I'll see you in the next video.
