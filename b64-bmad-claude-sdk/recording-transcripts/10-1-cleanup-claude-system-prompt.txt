Now I just want to point out some basic maintenance that I like to do with
working with Claude. So I've just put in this little prompt here and kick it off
and the reason is that we've created a brief, we've created a PRD but my initial
system prompt or the Claude prompt is pointing to the planning phase of the
system. But now that BMAD method has done these great documents I want to
ensure that my Claude file knows about them and so it's just making some minor
modifications. I don't want it to forget that we have a planning area and so
when and so it's seen this planning documents reference only and it's added
in the project brief and the PRD and so it's taken some old ideas like the
planning documents and the BMAD execution guide which now this one's not
relevant anymore and this one's just lower priority so it said we've got the
brief, we've got the PRD and then we've got the planning guide. Now a lot of
changes being made but if we go down the bottom and have a look at the summary we
can see that our system prompt has a very clear understanding of everything
we've done right now. One of the other things I notice, one of the other things
I noticed is that it knows that the next step is going to be the architecture so
if we come down and we will clear out again and start with a new Claude
context we'll go straight into the architecture agent, let it load and we
can move into creating things so we don't need the backend architecture and
front-end individually we just need the full stack architecture. It knows that
that's the next thing to do so we'll just paste that in and kick it off.
