Now if we go back to the top of the epic we'll see that every story follows a
common formula that's designed for agile development so firstly we've got a
story number so in this case it's 1.1 then we've got a simple title for what
the story is going to be about this is initializing the workspace in the mono
repo then we have the Conextra template this is also called a user story and the
original company that came up with this idea worked on the idea that as a being
who is this going to affect what do they want to achieve if the feature was put
in place and if they had achieved it what would it mean to them so the idea
of a user story is this three-part formula that says as a particular person
using the capability what do they want to achieve that's the I want and if they
did achieve it what would they get so that so in this case we've got as a
developer I want to have a properly configured NPN workspace so that I can
develop a server and client application and then there's an acceptance criteria
so this story is considered complete when all of these items are checked off
and this concept is going to repeat all the way through every and this concept
is going to repeat through every story in the epic
