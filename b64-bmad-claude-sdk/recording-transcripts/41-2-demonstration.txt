So we go and add a few more products and if we pop up the website hopefully
we're going to see it dynamically load because of the socket connection which
means that any updates on the server will automatically come through to the
client we're seeing that right there. If we don't like the style we can ask for
it to create a product CSS file. This is going to go with a professional blue and
gold color scheme. Now this probably won't update the HTML because we're
only asking for it to create the CSS at the moment and nothing has updated so
we'll just say update the products HTML so it uses the CSS. While we're doing
that we'll have a look at what it's created so we've got a bunch of CSS
created right here and it's just started writing the file and a refresh is
showing the blue and gold coming through on the website. Now there's a little
homepage if we click on that we're going to get a file not found. So what
we'll do is we'll come back to our chat client and put in create a HTML file.
This is the index we also want to feature a few products on the front page.
