So, the full conversation for this workflow was that we started with the AppyDave workflow
and figured out that it had done 2.5 and that it could move on to 2.6.
And so, it was able to start up the Scrum Master and create the story for us.
Now, because we'd made a lot of extensions within the 2.4 and the 2.5 story, I decided
to let it know that it was modeling these two stories, except rather than for data,
it was going to be for HTML.
And so, while there were major differences like the type of file and the location that
they were going to be, the actual tooling was pretty much the same.
And so, I suggested that it have a look at the 2.4 and the 2.5 story before recreating,
before updating this story with new capability.
From that, it was able to notice all the critical gaps that were in place and come up with four
separate tools to implement.
Before that, it only had one tool, which was writing the HTML.
Now, to show that this was an extensive change, we can see as we scroll through that there's
a lot of green and reds, a lot of stuff being taken out, a lot of new stuff being added,
but all very much in alignment with what was in 2.4 and 2.5 stories.
And so, as a summary, we can see that the data directory is the 2.4 and the 2.5 stories
and that, and the public directory is the 2.6 story.
So then we changed over to the development agent.
Everything pretty much went off without a hitch, though there were two different problems
that I did need to address, and you can see them here.
The first one was that it wasn't actually serving from the public directory.
I was able to test all the HTML, but not from the application, so that was a bit of a problem.
The other problem was that, the other problem was that when I was trying to display data
that we created in the previous story, it also wasn't showing through.
So I made a few modifications.
So I did a little bit of prompt engineering just to get the code working.
It was really easy to do because Cloud Code gave me option A, B, and C, and I just said
let's go with A and C, and it just wrote all the code that we needed, including some quality
of life changes, such as being able to call products on their own or products with .html,
which would be how the file was written.
