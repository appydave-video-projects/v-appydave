So let's test out our new chatbot and what we'll do is we'll search for
products first so can you tell me what products are available and we'll let
this prompt come through we'll press enter and so we can see this little
bubble coming up here that's what the user has said this is what the agent
SDK is responding with at the moment and there are our products we've got some
groceries we've got some beauty products nail art sort of stuff so let's create a
little website can you create a little HTML website called beauty and joy can
this be a nail art sort of store can we get both a HTML page and a CSS file and
we'll let that kick off and in a moment it'll come up with a plan of action and
here it's starting to happen and what we can also do is just head over to VS code
where we can see what we currently have we have a couple of websites here cat dog
index and AI TLDR and if we come back and we look at these little pages here
this is where we can see this and look at that it just created beauty and joy
so maybe that's already started let's go back and see whether it's created here
yes we can see it we've got a CSS file and a HTML file and that's why that came
about so let's go and click on that and see what we get okay we've got a
interesting looking nail art shop I think we can do better styling than that
so what I'll do is I'll bring it back here and say can you update the CSS
styling for the beauty and joy website and can you use this basic guidelines so
what we'll do is we'll just go down and paste some extra work and hopefully this
all show up cleanly here we go we've got soft modern feminine we got some primary
colors coming through and it should be updating the CSS very soon and it looks
like it's finished it's actually created a different HTML so if we go up we now
have two we have beauty and joy and we have beauty let's look at the old one
here's the old one and the new one is looking a fair bit more elegant now
ideally I would have liked that to actually update the original website but
for a first pass at a chatbot that can create data read data and also use it
for websites this is working really well
