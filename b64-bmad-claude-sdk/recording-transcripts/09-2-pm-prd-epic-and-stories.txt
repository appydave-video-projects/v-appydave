So at this point we've got many stories already set up for different epics. So
let's just look at the epics first. The first one is Monorepo set up with
client and server. So the basic application structure for the front end
talking to the back end. Next we have epic number two which is essentially
setting up the Claude agent SDK so that it can communicate from server through
to the client. And when you look at the goal there's also extra and when you
look at the goal there's also tools included such as talking to JSON and
HTML files. And the final epic, epic number three, is all about building a
react front end and using tools and using libraries like SHAVCN and Tailwind
CSS.
