1
00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:04,710
So that brings us to the end. And what we've been able to do is build this complete 

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:09,880
application just with natural language prompts. And we did that using context engineering. 

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,830
That's with the BMAD method. And the back end system that we've built is using the 

4
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:22,160
Claude Agent SDK. So this is giving us all the power of claude code within our own 

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,670
web applications. So the demonstrations we did was that we were able to create HTML 

6
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:34,160
pages, JSON documents, CSS files, make sure all the links go from page to page.

7
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,710
Now all the code is available. 

8
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:39,670
you can check it out in the repository. And if you want to join the community, we 

9
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:44,190
have more of a discussion and teachings each day on prompt engineering.

10
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:48,710
Now, if you're loving the power of BMAD in the next video, we're going to use BMAD 

11
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:54,70
Again. But this time we're going to recreate an orchestration framework, just like 

12
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:58,990
BMAD. We're going to call it POEM, which is the prompt orchestration and engineering 

13
00:00:59,30 --> 00:01:05,230
method. And the whole idea of it is so that we can create and test prompts in a technique 

14
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:09,350
very similar toBMAD. I'm AppyDave, I'll see you in the next video.
