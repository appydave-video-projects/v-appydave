So, we'll send that through to the agent and we can see the agent processing down the bottom
and here it comes through right now, we've got the HTML, we've now got our cat dog down
the bottom, let's click on that, see what we get and that is a brown, yellow and green
pet store.
So, that was pretty easy.
I think what we might do is see if we can make a change to the CSS, but firstly let's
have a list of files, we'll just say that for now, see what it comes up with.
It's processing, it's going to get them from both the public and the data which is interesting
and we can see all our product data down here, we can see our cat dog and our HTML file.
