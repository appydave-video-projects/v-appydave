And what we end up seeing is this relatively complex user interface where
if something matched properly that it was an easy find it's a hundred percent
confidence we'll see it with a tick. Other times we might get a hundred
percent confidence like we do with this one but the thing is it's from a video
that was number 40 in the chapter system and the reason for it in this
particular case is it was one of the demos that I did after generating the
complete video and so the order of this so the order of the raw recording is not
actually in sync with the finished product and so the order of the raw
recording is not in sync with the finished product and so the order of the
raw recording is not in sync with the finished video but it's still found it
okay. Then we have another one here called the recap and it's coming from
apparently video 19 so the fact that these are showing up with a little so
the fact that these are showing up with a little lightning bolt tells us that
there's probably out of sync because they've been found they've said it goes
into that position but this isn't actually the order that I recorded it so
either the problem is this did not find it correctly or I actually or I named
the files incorrectly. Now what this system is essentially allowed me to do
so far
