Now next up we're going to work on EPIC 2 which is the Claude agent SDK and what
that's going to allow us to do is put the equivalent of Claude code into our
server. So all the sorts of stuff you've seen me doing with Beamad which is
creating code, writing documents, doing research. Hopefully we can do that from
our own application so that we can build HTML pages and we can generate product
and blog post content.
