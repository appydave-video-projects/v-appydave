So we'll head back to Claude Code and we've got our Scrum Master set up and
we're going to draft story 2.1 and so we have our story created it's as a
developer I want a Claude Agent SDK installed and authenticated so that I
can implement so that I can implement agent capabilities so that I can
integrate the agent driven conversational capabilities into the
application now we'll do one extra step this time and we're going to go over to
the product owner agent and with this we're going to run this validate story
draft 2.1 and what that'll do is run a validation on the story that we've
already done and what it's really attempting to do here and this is an
optional task is just ensure that there were no hallucinations or mistakes made
in generating the story now I don't normally do the validation system
because it slows down my general workflow but sometimes what you notice
is that code goes off the rails and if you'd have done the validation you
would have saved yourself a lot of headaches so let's have a look at what
the validation system is trying to do so firstly it's an anti hallucination
protection is going on so it just doesn't it what it does is a QA against
just inventing stuff then what it does is make sure that all the documentation
it needs is internally stored within that story and then finally a whole lot
of checks and balances on the template and the sequence of the story so use
this sort of so use the product owner agents validate story with discretion
like when you think something's complex maybe you want to use it and you can
save yourself a lot of future headache if you and you can save a lot of future
headache because this will save a lot of future headache if things go off the
rails during the development cycle now so far we've gone through a full epic
without any issues so I didn't really need to do it but I thought I'd just
throw it in so you can see what it does so after that we go into developing the
2.1 task and everything was going really well created all the code that we needed
when the definition of done checklist and this is when a bunch of warnings
popped up so you can see here that there's an external dependency that we
need which is to authenticate into Claude so we'll just open up a new
terminal window and we'll paste that in and see what happens and it's asking if
we want to trust this folder and files will say yes to that so it's mentioned
that it can help me authenticate for this particular application it's going
to open the browser for authentication and connect to your pro or team and then
connect to your Claude and then allow you to connect to your Claude
subscription so I'm just going to press one see what it does it's run a Claude
authentication status we'll say yes on that so running to a little bit of an
issue there now what it's doing is checking the config Claude CLI folder
now it's saying that we're not authenticated it wants to run a workflow
we'll just say yes to this workflow so that didn't work from within Claude code
we'll run it externally in our own terminal so we'll run a Claude off login
