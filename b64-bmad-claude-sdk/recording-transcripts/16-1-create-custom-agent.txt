Now at this point we could be moving on to 1.3 but I suspect there might be
something in this code that we could test that we can see if it's working but
the problem is that we don't have a list of anything like that that we can check.
So I've gone and set myself up a new window this is a conversation I have
with a second brain and the second brain knows things like big and the second
brain has knowledge about things like BMAD version 4 and version 6 and I've
had it just construct for me instructions for creating a story
acceptance testing agent. Now I'll just point out behind the scenes what's
really going on is that if we do a tree you can see all the different documents
that I've got available on Claude so we've got the SDK here we've got Claude
code we've got skills and you can also see stuff on BMAD method we've got
mostly v4 but we've also got information on v6 as well and it's and it's through
having access to that information plus the project we're working on that we've
been able to build these instructions. So what I'm going to do is just take all
the information down to the bottom and we'll just go into our current
conversation and say can you create a new agent for me within the BMAD system
I'm going to paste the information in. So that's coming through and we'll paste
all that information and let it go. Now if this was version 6 of BMAD you would
have access to a system called BMB which is the BMAD module builder and if we go
back to our second brain you can see where I've gone that information there
is this BMB folder that allows you to create agents for different workflow
modules but because we're in v4 we don't have access to that module and so I've
just let it come through
Let's see...
Let's see...
Let's see...
Let's see...
Let's see...
So what I'm going to do is select the command we've got I've copied it into the
clipboard and it says that if we run it we should see some blue timestamp ISO
8601 format so what we'll do is we'll jump over to a terminal we'll paste it
in and see what happens when we run it and yep certainly does we've got some
line console items here so we can at least see visually that the application
is doing what it should do based on what the story is saying so the good
thing is we can see what the application is meant to do based on what the story
says it should do now this is a little bit different to a user acceptance test
because this will change from story to story something that would have been a
UAT in say 1.1 might now be defunct and not useful in 1.3 so it's not quite the
same as a UAT which is generally for the life of the application this is only for
the life of the story so now we'll come down to AC4 this is about checking the
health of the server apparently if we hit the API health endpoint we should
get a status okay so I'm just coming up to a terminal and we'll run it and yes
it's saying status okay so that's just a quick so that's just a quick
demonstration on how you can create your own agents at any time it's easy to just
say model it after something give it a little bit of instructions on what to do
one of the things I find with that particular agent that I did is that some
of those commands like was the terminal blue is not something I need to visually
check but I could get the AI to do it so I tend to split it up into two groups
those that I have to go and check out myself like entering in a form did I see
an error message versus the ones that could just be tested by the term by
versus the ones that could just be tested by Claude code itself now you
might be thinking well hang on doesn't this fit in with end-to-end testing or
playwright and stuff like that and yes it does but I find they're quite hard to
set up they they're quite fragile as well whereas this is just the story is
finished go and test it out but hang on you might be saying what about playwright
or end-to-end tests could you set them up and the answer is yes you can you
probably should but I find that they're quite hard to get going they're very
fragile so they're always breaking and you spend more time wasted around in
debugging them where then all you really want in this particular case is do the
forms work the way the story said they were going to be implemented and I need
to test it visually anyway I can't purely rely on e2e testing and this is
where the SAT agent is really good so at that point I've just come back to Claude
code and what we're going to do is just do a commit and push this up now I did
forget one thing I also should update my Claude code one of the statements that
we set up here is that BMAD core is getting ignored and it may have done
something in here to get around that we'll go and check what's going on but
this is why when you move to version 6 they've got mechanisms in place to
extend the workflows that should be a little bit better than the way I've just
done it right here this was a little bit of a hack
