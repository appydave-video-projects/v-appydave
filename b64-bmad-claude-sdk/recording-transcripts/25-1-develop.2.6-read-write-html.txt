Now, with Story 2.6, our conversational bot is now starting to get really powerful.
So what we'll do is we'll start off with a simple question and that's what HTML files
exist in the public directory.
Now this is one of the Story acceptance tests, it's the first one, and there's going to be
a whole lot of prompts that we can run through and see what it can do.
And you can see here it's saying that there are currently no HTML files in the public
directory.
And if we head down to VS Code we can confirm that.
So we've got our data directory from the last session available, but in the server when
we click on public there's nothing there right now.
