Now this is an area where you probably want to work through in interactive mode
but because it's a video we're just going to go with number two we're going
to go with YOLO mode. She already has a lot of context she understands the
project brief that I've decided upfront that this is about three epics. I know
the structure of the application I'd like to see happen. Some technology stat
decisions have been made, architecture and implementation guides, I've even got
the demo workflow talked about in the planning guide. So what this is really
doing is preparing that information in a structure that BMAD can work with.
