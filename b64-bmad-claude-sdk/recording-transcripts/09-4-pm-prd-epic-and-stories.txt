So what I'll do now is I'll read through every story headline and then we'll see
pretty quickly that there may be some flaws in the way that it's come up with.
So the first thing it wants to do in the Epic is initialize the NPM workspaces
and Monorepo. That sounds really good. Then it's going to create an express
TypeScript server. After that it's going to get a very basic HTML client up and
running. And finally we're just going to have a little bit of an end-to-end test
and mainly that'll be worked out by starting both servers and checking the
browser logs, checking the console logs. So so far Epic number one looks pretty
good. We'll see if it needs any changes when we look at the next Epic.
