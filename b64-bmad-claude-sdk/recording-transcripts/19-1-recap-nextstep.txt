So at this point we have finished our first feature, our first epic in the
system. We have this client and server application. It uses socket IO and has
bio directional communication meaning that we can type something in the text
box and it immediately hits the server or if the server was to want to
communicate with the client it could do that as well. Now all the code and now
all the code and prompt sequences are available up on the
github repo if you want to access that. There's a link to my community down
below.
