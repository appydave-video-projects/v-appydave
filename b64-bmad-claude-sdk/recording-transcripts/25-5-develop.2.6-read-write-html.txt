So what I think I want to do now is create a new HTML file. We'll go with a
CSS file as well and we'll try and use the JSON documents we've got. I think
we've got a test product so let's see what we can do. So the prompt will go
can you create a HTML file called a ITLDR.html and can we create a CSS file
to go with that. Can the colors of that file, can the colors of that CSS be
light blue, dark blue and white and can we make sure that we're displaying a
whole lot of products. Can the products come from our test products JSON
document. So I'll just let that prompt come through there it is and we press
enter. So there's a couple of typos in there but it looks like we're going to
create a HTML file matching CSS file. We've got JSON files to work with
hopefully. Perfect now let me check what pages exist and while that's happening
what AITLDR is is one of my other channels. This is a faceless YouTube
channel where most of the focus is on YouTube storytelling. So we've got
something coming through they're not necessarily the colors we normally use
but let's go and click on this and see what we get. AITLDR product catalog and
this is really interesting from a few points of view. So the actual widgets
that are in the product listing, Happy Dave on School, Suga, this has all come
through but we've even got the HTML links so we can get to the home page. Can
we get to the cat and dog? We can get to the cat and dog. What about products?
That's taking us to where we are and if we go back to the chat interface look at
that. So at this point we've almost achieved everything I wanted with this
project. It was the ability to create any sort of data we want. Let's go and test
the idea of updating data. Can you go and add three different products about
nail polish? Let that come through and send that to the agent and what I'm
hoping it'll do is it'll come up with three interesting products. It should be
able to add it to the only file we've got which is the test dot products.
Probably should go and rename that. Well let's just go back to this. It can see
the file it's now apparently added things. Oh look at that it's showing them
as well. So we'll go and click on the AITLDR page and see what that's showing.
Okay we've got five products. Now our page hasn't updated but if I go down to
Visual Studio we can see that three actual products have been added. So my
assumption is it's not reading from the JavaScript and it's not. It's actually
been hard-coded so maybe we can modify that. So we're going to work with the
idea of can we update the HTML of AITLDR so that the products are actually just
reading from that URL. So we'll send that through. While that's doing its thing we
can have a look at the URL. This is the data that's available to us. It says
that the page is working. Let's go and click on it and look at that we've got
eight products. We've got three new products added. So yeah we're using our
chat interface to both create data, update data, delete it. Well we don't know
whether it can delete and to actually modify the HTML. So let's see if we can
do one more compound idea. So we'll go with can you delete the widget based
products from the test products JSON and can you change the CSS for the AITLDR
website so that it is using pinks and light sort of colors. Make sure you're
updating the CSS file. So we'll let that prompt come through.
