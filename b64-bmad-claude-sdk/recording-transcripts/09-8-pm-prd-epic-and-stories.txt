So with the very complete epic list in place we'll come back to our
conversation and just move on to the next step which is the checklist. So what
the checklist has done is just read the PRD. Now this is from a product owner or
product managers point of view so this is all the business cases have been
covered. We haven't yet gone to the tech stack or the software architects point
of view that's the next area but when we look at it it says it's 92%
complete there's some problems with it but it's mentioned that the user
research area isn't really that relevant for a demonstration like this so I won't
worry about it and so everything else has passed except for this area in the
MVP. So any blockers to moving forward well there's none identified are there
any high-level issues that we should be aware of. I think this is one we might
address but we'll do it using it asking a recommendation rather than actually
taking the time to define it because the AI will probably do a better job
than me at coming up with an answer anyway. These medium level issues don't
really matter to me like the target user doesn't matter and the success metrics
don't matter in this particular project. Now this low level one I will get it to
come up with a solution here I don't want to use an external framework I
don't need a logging system but I do want something consistent about the way
we do logging. Now my background has been software engineering software
architecture and even for a time a scrum master so these numbers that you're
seeing here the 23 days to get this application written are legitimate
numbers this is about how long it would take to do a project like this if you
were doing it in an enterprise system but at the end of the video I'll tell
you how long it's taken to do the documentation and to do the coding so
we'll see what numbers really come back. So I've just dictated a little statement
about the outer scope area like what does it suggest we put in there and I've
also said that for the logging I don't want to use a logging framework but I
wouldn't mind some simplistic patterns predefined before we get started and
this is perfect this is just what I didn't want to actually type in myself
so we're not going to use database and persistent authentication
authorization isn't needed it's not for production testing infrastructure is
not important in this process advanced features like quality gate hooks all
this sort of stuff was all out of scope for me it doesn't need to be a polished
UI though I hope it'll be pretty good with ShadCN and Tailwind CSS and
developer experience well that's something I wouldn't mind so we might
actually change that one area and the logging and monitoring is also really
good it's come up with just a simple JavaScript logo platform it's not trying
to use libraries or anything like that so we can go with all of that so I'm
just asking it to update the PRD with all the changes the only little change
I mentioned is that the hot module reloading which is a developer
experience I don't want that to not be in the system because that really helps
us develop quicker if when you change some code you automatically see it in
the browser this is a great capability to keep so changes like modifying a bit
of code and seeing it updated directly in the client is a really nice
capability to have in the application from the from the beginning so we can
see that our documents been updated our change log we've got a out of scope
section we've got logging patterns and we got advanced developer experience
details added so we're all complete with our PRD at this point it's suggesting
that we hand off to the architect we could do it in this conversation but
what we'll do is we'll just exit out of Claude and clear up and start a new
Claude session because we want to have a clean context to get up and running with
the architecture
