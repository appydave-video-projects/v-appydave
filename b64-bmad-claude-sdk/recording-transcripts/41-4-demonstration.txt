So the three articles we've got, Golden Age of Reading, Building Your Personal
Library and we've got Philosophy in Pages. Let's go and add another blog post to
the blog post Jason. With that happening it should just automatically add it to
the HTML. It's in the middle of writing and what do we got, Creating Your Home
Library and we have Creating Your Home Library. So at that point it might be
good to think about it's coming up to Christmas. Can we have a design that
makes sense? So we'll apply a Christmas styling to the product CSS with snow,
fall, animation, red, green colors and festive red green colors. So that's
about to come through and it's started to come through. There's a couple of
bugs. There's styling bugs and we can't currently click on the blog post. So
here's our Christmas theme. We've got some tinsel coming through. If we go
through to the products we can see similar stuff happening here. There's a
little bit of a delay. If we go over to the blog, if we go over to the, if we go
over to the blog we can see the tinsel coming through here. One thing you might
notice though is that there were a number of attempts to get this working.
So we started with apply Christmas styling to the product CSS and had to
follow it up with five different prompts to get it working across all the
different pages. It had a recommendation to go with scalable vector graphics so
that was the recommendation we went through.
