So for story 1.4 I've just run everything at once I haven't done any
testing yet we started off with Bob the Scrum Master he created the story. I went
a little bit premature into Taylor for the story acceptance test because that
can be derived from the story but it should also be done after the
development so I needed to do a bit of an update later. I also ran James to
develop all the code and then did Quinn to do the quality assurance. So the new
documentation files are that we have a story we have an SAT and we have a Q&A
document and from a code point of view we've got new files plus a little bit of
an update to the readme.

so we can see the endpoints that we want to test but if we go and look at the
SAT plan we've got a little bit of console logging that we should see in
chat and we should see some server responses if we type anything into the
chat window apparently it can also handle a disconnection so let's go test
them out so here's our web application we'll hit refresh and it's saying that
we're currently connected let's just say let's just say Appy Dave here press
enter and we're getting a response received I've just asked it to kill the
server over in Claude code because I think it's running in the background
over here I didn't actually start it and look at that it's starting to say that
it's disconnected what I'll do is restart it from the terminal myself and
if we come back to our web application hopefully it just automatically
reconnects
