We've just completed story 3.3 and we're really close to the end of
building the application and what you can see now is that it started to come
together quite nicely. We'll demonstrate where it's at in a moment but I'll point
out that this is the 14th story that we've done and every story we've done
up until this one just came across without a hitch. It was able to be
created, it was validated, it was written by the software developer. We were able
to do the story acceptance testing and we were able to do the QA afterwards and
everything was really quite quick. This is the one story where everything
changed so I'll do a little bit of a post-mortem analysis of it as well
after I've demonstrated where we're at.

So let's test out our new chatbot and what we'll do is we'll search for
products first so can you tell me what products are available and we'll let
this prompt come through we'll press enter and so we can see this little
bubble coming up here that's what the user has said this is what the agent
SDK is responding with at the moment and there are our products we've got some
groceries we've got some beauty products nail art sort of stuff so let's create a
little website can you create a little HTML website called beauty and joy can
this be a nail art sort of store can we get both a HTML page and a CSS file and
we'll let that kick off and in a moment it'll come up with a plan of action and
here it's starting to happen and what we can also do is just head over to VS code
where we can see what we currently have we have a couple of websites here cat dog
index and AI TLDR and if we come back and we look at these little pages here
this is where we can see this and look at that it just created beauty and joy
so maybe that's already started let's go back and see whether it's created here
yes we can see it we've got a CSS file and a HTML file and that's why that came
about so let's go and click on that and see what we get okay we've got a
interesting looking nail art shop I think we can do better styling than that
so what I'll do is I'll bring it back here and say can you update the CSS
styling for the beauty and joy website and can you use this basic guidelines so
what we'll do is we'll just go down and paste some extra work and hopefully this
all show up cleanly here we go we've got soft modern feminine we got some primary
colors coming through and it should be updating the CSS very soon and it looks
like it's finished it's actually created a different HTML so if we go up we now
have two we have beauty and joy and we have beauty let's look at the old one
here's the old one and the new one is looking a fair bit more elegant now
ideally I would have liked that to actually update the original website but
for a first pass at a chatbot that can create data read data and also use it
for websites this is working really well

Now, I said that this story wasn't actually as successful in the coding as any other story
that we've done, but let's have a look at what it was originally.
It's built a chat interface with Versal AI as a developer, a chat interface using the
AI element patterns so that users can send messages and have streaming agent responses.
Now, that's working, and so I'm pretty happy with that, but let's look at what the post
post.
But let's have a look at the post more, Tom, and this is where a number of issues happen.
Now, part of the issues happen because I think when I was doing it, I was really tired, so
I wasn't paying attention to different things going on, but the main issue, which I seem
to run into every time I do Tailwind and totally forgot about it in this particular case, is
it got configured with V3 syntax, but it was a version for Tailwind.
So in the last story, you would have seen the styling, and I said it was pretty normal.
That should be what it's like, and you might have noticed in the last story that there
was styling that looked pretty average, and I said, well, that's actually how it's meant
to be.
Well, that's not the case, and the reason is that the Tailwind styling was misconfigured
and it took a little while to find it out.
Another issue that was happening under the hood for me is that one of the servers, there
are two in this, was meant to be running on 5173, but Claude was actually running a separate
one on 5174, and so I was trying to see updates, and nothing was coming through, and I kept
saying to Claude, this is not working, and he kept saying, I fixed it, but I wasn't seeing
anything visually.
Now again, a lot of that was me tired at the time, but this is one of the realities of
having AI agents that can run the servers for you, is that if they've got a conflict
with your current server, then it's just going to spawn a new one on a different port.
Then it had a bunch of issues with the bubbles, and the drop-down menu that we saw showing
up underneath the bubbles.
Now the reason I actually wrote this document wasn't just so that I could show you the sort
of challenges that you can run into, but because once you write a document like this, you can
make it a part of your documentation system, so if any other issues happen in the future
and you notice it, you can say, can you go and read other documentation or lessons learnt
that were done in the past, and this can be a perfect way of training the AI model to
write code the right way if you see a certain problem showing up again and again.
