So that brings us to the end of EPIC 2 and what we can now do is we can add
products or any sort of data that we like we can update it we can also play
around with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and we could call this a complete application
but if we look at what EPIC number 3 is going to be about we'll be able to give
the chat interface a much needed upgrade and we'll do it by going to react we'll
use and we'll do that by going to react where we'll use Vite, ShadCN, Tailwind, CSS
and we'll use the Versel AI elements to give a really clean chat interface. Now
it's a fairly simple EPIC we're going to initialize the react application then
we're going to install the ShadCN and configure Tailwind CSS then we'll build
the chat interface again using Versel AI elements and lastly we'll implement a
simple dark mode, light mode, total.
