Now, what we're building today is this self-editing application.
We're going to use the Claude Agent SDK and the BMAD method.

Now if this all works, what we'll be demonstrating is the idea of creating a bunch of products,
building out a product listing, maybe even a details page for it, adding a home page,
making some of those products featured and then adding more products along the way.

Now, the magic of a self-editing application is firstly this human experience, so we'll
be able to talk to the computer, have it generate features, have it generate data, and we'll
be doing that using vibe coding sort of techniques.
But the way we implement it, the technical reality is that we're going to use context
engineering and the framework we're going to use is the BMAD method to build this application
in front of us.
But the technical reality of this is that we're going to use context engineering via
the BMAD method to build the application, it'll build all the data.
But the technical reality of this is that we're going to use context engineering using
the BMAD method and tools like the Agent SDK to make this application a reality.

Now let's just talk a little bit about the planning ahead of time. So I've
already got a planning folder in place for what we're going to do. I've got some
preliminary tech stack stuff but I want to run all of this through the BMAD
method. Now which version of the BMAD method should we use? Should we use
version 4 which is the current or should we use the version 6 alpha 9? Now I tried
a video yesterday on alpha 8 and I don't particularly believe it's ready for use
just yet for this sort of project. So we're going to work with version 4 and
that means what we're going to do is use this command here, mpx BMAD method
install. If you do want to use the version 6 it's all available. Now the few
problems I ran into I had a conversation with Brian from the BMAD method and he
is aware of it and he's talking through the changes that are coming in place
related to those issues but for today we'll keep it simple and work with
version 4.

Now in the repo that we're building all this which is 07BMAD Claude SDK you can
go to the bottom and find the links so here's the link to the version 4 BMAD
and if you scroll down a little bit we'll go and select our starting command
with that selected we can go over to our terminal and I've already got some pages
here the files that you were just seeing the readme that you were just seeing is
in here at that location and I've got a planning phase in my documents
directory already so we'll clear that out and so we've cleared the screen and
putting in the MPX BMAD method install and that's going to walk us through a
wizard
