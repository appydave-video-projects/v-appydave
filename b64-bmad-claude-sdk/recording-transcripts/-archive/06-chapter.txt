Now, I'll just take a moment out to suggest that if you want a little bit more hand-holding
or just seeing day-to-day operations on using the BMAD method, context engineering to produce
applications or other sorts of business systems, then you might want to check the link in the
description where you can go to my school community where I'll be talking about this
on a day-by-day basis.
But next, let's go and look at creating this PRD.
Now, to do that, we're going to have to have a new agent, and the agent we want is the
project manager.
So, we load the project manager in with the slash pm command, and John comes into existence
with a whole lot of capabilities.
Now, the one we want is the star create PRD, so we just paste that in, and let's see what
comes up.
And you notice that the way BMAD works is it works with context documents, so we've
got the create doc.md.
There was also a template going on, which we can see here, and a bit of configuration
YAML.
Now, in version 6, a lot of this stuff still happens similarly, but they've made it a lot
more flexible.
