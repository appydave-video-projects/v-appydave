Moving on to story 2.7 which is a new story that came about because we encountered a bug
where if you typed in a couple of messages it didn't understand the previous messages.
So we've put it in place and what I thought we'd do is test it by maybe changing the title of this particular website
and at the same time also change the price of just cats and we'll do that in two separate messages.
So we'll start off, so here's our first prompt, can you change the title of the cat dog website
so that rather than saying cat and dog pet store it just says pet store.
So we'll kick that off and then we'll start the next prompt and it should be,
can you look at all the cats in the products table or can you look at,
can you have a look at the cats in the cat pet,
can you go to the cat dog website and change every product that is related to a cat so that it is $100 more
and we'll just press enter on that one.
Now if we look at the current website it says cat and dog pet store,
now I've done a refresh on it and we can see that the pet store has been updated.
What we want to do is see after a refresh if this $24.99 becomes,
we want to see if the $24.99 becomes $124.99
and we can see in the conversation that it's made a couple of changes right here.
So we'll come over and it's these two that need to change and they have changed.
So there's the new value and we've got the old value as $24.99 in cat and dog pet store.
So from a conversational point of view it was pretty much the standard workflow.
We started off with the AppyDave workflow, we created the 2.7 story, we validated it.
The minor change here was that I asked it to go and read the documentation around the SDK
and we have a second brain of information around that particular tool.
And we have a second brain of information around the Claude SDK.
The basic findings from that were all listed and updated the story.
We then just did our standard development phase.
We did an SAT, there was nothing in there other than to run the two commands that I did.
And so we just finish off with a review from the QA agent
and we'll do the last commit for this particular story.
And we'll do the last commit for this epi.
