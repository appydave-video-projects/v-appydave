Now we are on story 3.2 and there's not a lot to be seen just yet. We've got an
installation of ShadCN and UI and if we pop it up what we'll see is this user
interface with the basic typing area in place. We've got to click me and we've got
some buttons and the styling is very ordinary at the moment and according to
the component verification that's exactly what we want to see at the
moment.
