We've just completed story 3.3 and we're really close to the end of
building the application and what you can see now is that it started to come
together quite nicely. We'll demonstrate where it's at in a moment but I'll point
out that this is the 14th story that we've done and every story we've done
up until this one just came across without a hitch. It was able to be
created, it was validated, it was written by the software developer. We were able
to do the story acceptance testing and we were able to do the QA afterwards and
everything was really quite quick. This is the one story where everything
changed so I'll do a little bit of a post-mortem analysis of it as well
after I've demonstrated where we're at.
