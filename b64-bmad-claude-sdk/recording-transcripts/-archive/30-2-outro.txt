Now if you're loving the power of BeMAD, in the next video we're going to use
BeMAD again, but this time we're going to recreate an orchestration framework
just like BeMAD. We're going to call it POM, which is the Prompt Orchestration
and Engineering Method, and the whole idea of it is so that we can create and
test prompts in a technique very similar to BeMAD. I'm Happy Dave, I'll see you in
the next video.
