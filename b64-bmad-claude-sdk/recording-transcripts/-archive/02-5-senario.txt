Now in the repo that we're building all this which is 07BMAD Claude SDK you can
go to the bottom and find the links so here's the link to the version 4 BMAD
and if you scroll down a little bit we'll go and select our starting command
with that selected we can go over to our terminal and I've already got some pages
here the files that you were just seeing the readme that you were just seeing is
in here at that location and I've got a planning phase in my documents
directory already so we'll clear that out and so we've cleared the screen and
putting in the MPX BMAD method install and that's going to walk us through a
wizard
