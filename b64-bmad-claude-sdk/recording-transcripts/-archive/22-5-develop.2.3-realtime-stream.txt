Now let's get back to the workflow because I created a custom workflow to
build all this out so that it could just run without too much input from me and
it's called the AppyDave workflow what it does is it starts off by asking a
question what story do you want to have so we did 2.3 at that point it started
creating the story and it did that by starting up the Scrum Master and running
the draft story command and as per normal we got a detailed story written
it's in draft format at the moment and it's as a developer I want to stream
responses so that the end users can see information progressively now we've seen
that working so we know it's all going on it wrote the initial plan of what the
code should look like in the story and then and then it give and then it gave
me this status update so we can see that it's in draft or the acceptance
criteria is there and it's got a couple of questions do I want to continue do I
want to skip or exit so I just so we got this final status of what's going on
what is the status of the doc so we got this final update of so we got a final
summary of the creation of the story we can see that it's in draft mode at the
moment and it's asked me do I want to continue on to validation or skip now I
said that the validation is optional but I decided to just press continue and we
can see it's now going into and we can see that it's now going to the product
owner and validating the information in the story against other documents

I don't think when you've finished off working through the
Happy Dave workflow that you did the QA bot.

No, no, that is right.
A review story does not create a markdown document.
The workflow is meant to load in the QA bot and then run the review story command.
What about our workflow is not doing that?
Okay.
Okay.

Are you keeping our workflow document up to date or giving it extra information to remind
it not to screw up?
