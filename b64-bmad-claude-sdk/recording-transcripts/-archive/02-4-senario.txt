Now let's just talk a little bit about the planning ahead of time. So I've
already got a planning folder in place for what we're going to do. I've got some
preliminary tech stack stuff but I want to run all of this through the BMAD
method. Now which version of the BMAD method should we use? Should we use
version 4 which is the current or should we use the version 6 alpha 9? Now I tried
a video yesterday on alpha 8 and I don't particularly believe it's ready for use
just yet for this sort of project. So we're going to work with version 4 and
that means what we're going to do is use this command here, mpx BMAD method
install. If you do want to use the version 6 it's all available. Now the few
problems I ran into I had a conversation with Brian from the BMAD method and he
is aware of it and he's talking through the changes that are coming in place
related to those issues but for today we'll keep it simple and work with
version 4.
