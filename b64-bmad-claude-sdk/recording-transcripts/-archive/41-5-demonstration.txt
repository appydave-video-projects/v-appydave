Now since it's Christmas I think we should take the sold out item and do an
article about promoting some of it. So we'll write a blog post announcing that
there's a special that the product has gone from $32 to $22 but there's only
10 left. Now the article has been written but we better go and update the
products so that it's in stock and we have a price for it. We'll click on
products and this is the product that we're looking to see change and there it
is it's changed through it might be useful to change the color as well.
We're just asking for it to be highlighted at the moment and there's
our holiday special slightly misaligned but we'll leave that for now and let's
also make sure that the home page has an update for the products. Let's make sure
the home page has a product for the holiday special. I'm not sure where it's
going to put it and it's starting to write the file right now and we had to
refresh because this is not a product being delivered via socket.io and here's
our holiday specials. Let's see what happens if we view it in the catalogue
and here's our holiday special exclusive and we should be able to
view it in the catalogue. Let's test an after Christmas cleanup so what we'll do
is we'll remove all the styling from the CSS also remove any animations if they're
found. We'll set the stock to 2 so we sold a few products and we'll put the
price back to $32 so the styling has come through it's still writing out
information.
Please remove this special from the home page.
Please remove this special from the home page.
Snow and confetti is still showing up on all the pages I did ask you to remove
that.
