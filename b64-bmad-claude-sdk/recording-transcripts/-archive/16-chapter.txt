Now at this point we could be moving on to 1.3 but I suspect there might be
something in this code that we could test that we can see if it's working but
the problem is that we don't have a list of anything like that that we can check.
So I've gone and set myself up a new window this is a conversation I have
with a second brain and the second brain knows things like big and the second
brain has knowledge about things like BMAD version 4 and version 6 and I've
had it just construct for me instructions for creating a story
acceptance testing agent. Now I'll just point out behind the scenes what's
really going on is that if we do a tree you can see all the different documents
that I've got available on Claude so we've got the SDK here we've got Claude
code we've got skills and you can also see stuff on BMAD method we've got
mostly v4 but we've also got information on v6 as well and it's and it's through
having access to that information plus the project we're working on that we've
been able to build these instructions. So what I'm going to do is just take all
the information down to the bottom and we'll just go into our current
conversation and say can you create a new agent for me within the BMAD system
I'm going to paste the information in. So that's coming through and we'll paste
all that information and let it go. Now if this was version 6 of BMAD you would
have access to a system called BMB which is the BMAD module builder and if we go
back to our second brain you can see where I've gone that information there
is this BMB folder that allows you to create agents for different workflow
modules but because we're in v4 we don't have access to that module and so I've
just let it come through
Let's see...
Let's see...
Let's see...
Let's see...
Let's see...
So what I'm going to do is select the command we've got I've copied it into the
clipboard and it says that if we run it we should see some blue timestamp ISO
8601 format so what we'll do is we'll jump over to a terminal we'll paste it
in and see what happens when we run it and yep certainly does we've got some
line console items here so we can at least see visually that the application
is doing what it should do based on what the story is saying so the good
thing is we can see what the application is meant to do based on what the story
says it should do now this is a little bit different to a user acceptance test
because this will change from story to story something that would have been a
UAT in say 1.1 might now be defunct and not useful in 1.3 so it's not quite the
same as a UAT which is generally for the life of the application this is only for
the life of the story so now we'll come down to AC4 this is about checking the
health of the server apparently if we hit the API health endpoint we should
get a status okay so I'm just coming up to a terminal and we'll run it and yes
it's saying status okay so that's just a quick so that's just a quick
demonstration on how you can create your own agents at any time it's easy to just
say model it after something give it a little bit of instructions on what to do
one of the things I find with that particular agent that I did is that some
of those commands like was the terminal blue is not something I need to visually
check but I could get the AI to do it so I tend to split it up into two groups
those that I have to go and check out myself like entering in a form did I see
an error message versus the ones that could just be tested by the term by
versus the ones that could just be tested by Claude code itself now you
might be thinking well hang on doesn't this fit in with end-to-end testing or
playwright and stuff like that and yes it does but I find they're quite hard to
set up they they're quite fragile as well whereas this is just the story is
finished go and test it out but hang on you might be saying what about playwright
or end-to-end tests could you set them up and the answer is yes you can you
probably should but I find that they're quite hard to get going they're very
fragile so they're always breaking and you spend more time wasted around in
debugging them where then all you really want in this particular case is do the
forms work the way the story said they were going to be implemented and I need
to test it visually anyway I can't purely rely on e2e testing and this is
where the SAT agent is really good so at that point I've just come back to Claude
code and what we're going to do is just do a commit and push this up now I did
forget one thing I also should update my Claude code one of the statements that
we set up here is that BMAD core is getting ignored and it may have done
something in here to get around that we'll go and check what's going on but
this is why when you move to version 6 they've got mechanisms in place to
extend the workflows that should be a little bit better than the way I've just
done it right here this was a little bit of a hack

So what I've done is started a new cloud code we've gone over to the scrum master
we started drafting story 1.3 so it's finished creating the story it's put it
into the 1.2 story right here we've got a bunch of we've got a bait we've got a
bunch of basic information here but let's head over to visual studio I've
already set it to ready I think after it gets through the tasks the main thing
that we're going to want to look at is the fact that there's now a HTML page so
we should be able to see something apparently there's going to be a little
bit of JavaScript going on so let's go back and start developing so I'm just
letting it load up the developer and once that's done we can just develop
story 1.3 so now the development is finished it looks like we're going to
have an index file that we can go and look at we'll do the SAT soon but let's
just go over to the QA bot for a moment and we'll run our review on 1.3 while
that's running we'll just do a quick check of the document it says all the
tasks done there should be a public directory we've got the HTML index we've
got script tags coming through in a moment we should see an update to the
QA results we're also going to see a new gate file added here so the QA results
are in we've got a new gate file we can see the story we will check an SAT soon
there's updates to the packages the client application now has a the client
application now has an index HTML page going on we've got a new server file and
if we close it down we've also got a public folder which I think is where
it's going to serve up static files so let's go and test our story acceptance
bot so if we type in so let's go and test our story acceptance spot we should
be able to type in SAT and we've got SAT so currently Taylor is loading into
memory we've got a create SAT command available we've also got an update SAT
command now we'll kick off the create and this command this one here that we
haven't used yet is just in case I don't like the instructions that the current
bot has we've got the ability to update the bot so this is reading out SAT is
reading the story that's going to be the source of truth it's also looking at
some of the code that's been created like the client index HTML and at the
end of this we should have a new file just sitting next to 1.3 story so it's
just created it let's pop it open so the story itself was about creating a basic
HTML page and the human test that we can do requires us to run the server which
I've just done and then it wants to go to the chat window and we should see a
BMAD plus Claude SDK test client we should see a blue header called client
server communication test let's just bring it up how that looks like it and
it's also got a text input box saying enter a message optional yep that's in
case that's in place and blue button labeled test the health expert and a
blue button labeled test health endpoint it's also saying gray response area with
test response will go here I wonder if it works now we'll come back to having a
look at our form we've got some things around styling I'm not that concerned
about that what's this form submission without a page reload should just say
server status response should just say server response status is okay and
apparently there's no page reload so we'll bring up our website and we'll
click on test endpoint and there wasn't a refresh but we did see the server
response update apparently there's a bonus visual test we can stop the
server which I've just done and if we click on test health endpoint we get
found to fetch make sure the server is running so that's really cool I wasn't
planning to create the SAT agent as part of this video but this is the idea of it
is that you don't have to think about what the code did it tells you what has
happened and tells you how to reproduce it which is which just saves you a heap
of time when you're using the be mad method to develop an application we'll
come back to our terminal where I was running that server and we'll just clean
up after ourselves so we'll do a bit of a commit right now and we've got a great
commit message everything's listed we can just push this code right here and
now we just exit out and go on to the next
