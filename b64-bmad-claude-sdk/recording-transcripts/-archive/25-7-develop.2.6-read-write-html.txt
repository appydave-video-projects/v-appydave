So we're testing 2.7 which is conversation memory this is a new ticket
because we found a bug earlier in the epic and what we're going to do is
firstly just find out the prices of cats so the prompt will be can you have a
look in the cat dog HTML and just give me the prices of any cat related product
and we'll press enter on that now if we look inside we can see negative a hundred
dollars so if we look inside we can see negative a hundred dollars for the two
cat products so we'll just come back here and that's what it says and we'll
go with can you change the prices to $49.95 and $69.95 respectively and we'll
press enter on that so hopefully we're going to see this one become $49.95 and
this one become $69.95 so this is looking great it seems like it's done
the right products let's go over to the product listing we'll do a refresh and
we we have it $49.69.95
