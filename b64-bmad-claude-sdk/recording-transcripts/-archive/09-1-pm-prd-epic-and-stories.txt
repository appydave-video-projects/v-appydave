So I just press one to move forward and we've got our epic list and it looks
like there's going to be three epics which is what I'd suggested it to do
anyway. So we've got the mono repo set up with basic client and server, npm
workspaces, we've got an express server, minimal HTML client, so that looks good.
After that we're really working on the backend which is the agent SDK
integration. It's going to have the three tools that it talked about and then
we're going to polish up the communication. We should already be
working hopefully and then we're going to polish up the communication with the
front-end chat interface here. This is going to use ShadCN and Versel AI agents.
Versel AI elements. So then we've got our sequencing logic. I think the good bit
is the story count. It's listing three to four stories per epic. There isn't a lot
of work in each section. And then it's listed its rationale and decisions. I
read through that. This all seems to make sense for me. So we're moving forward.
I've pressed one and moving on to the next section which is going to be the
epic details and we'll present each epic with all the stories. Now just so you
know it hasn't updated the PRD yet. We're still sitting on the non-functional
requirements and it shouldn't do that until it's got the detail about each
story.
