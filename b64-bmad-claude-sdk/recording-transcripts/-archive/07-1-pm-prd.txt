Now you may notice when you start with a clean Claude code is that the context is empty and
so certain things it doesn't know about.
So this idea of do you have a project brief, which we just worked on, is something it doesn't
currently know about.
So I'm just going to put in one, that's what we want to do, and I'll put in the at sign
and start typing brief.
And we'll just press enter so it'll use that as loaded context.
