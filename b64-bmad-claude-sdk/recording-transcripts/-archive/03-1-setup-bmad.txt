So let's work through step-by-step and the first thing is the folder. Now it's
opened it up to an MPS directory so what I'm going to do is put in the
directory where we're building this application today. After that it's
talking about different frameworks of BMAD that we can install. This all
changes a fair bit in version 6. We've got better games set up in that
particular version. For now we'll just go with the Agile Core. In version 4 when
it comes to the PRD product requirements document and the architecture
document you can shard the files meaning that they can be split up into
individual files after generation. This changes a little bit in version 6 but
for today we'll say yes and then you can decide on what agent coding system you're
going to use. I'm using Claude code so we'll just select that and in this
example we're not going to use Gemini or Codex so I'm going to say no to those
models.
