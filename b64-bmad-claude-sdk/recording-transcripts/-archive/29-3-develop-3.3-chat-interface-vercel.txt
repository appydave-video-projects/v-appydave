Now, I said that this story wasn't actually as successful in the coding as any other story
that we've done, but let's have a look at what it was originally.
It's built a chat interface with Versal AI as a developer, a chat interface using the
AI element patterns so that users can send messages and have streaming agent responses.
Now, that's working, and so I'm pretty happy with that, but let's look at what the post
post.
But let's have a look at the post more, Tom, and this is where a number of issues happen.
Now, part of the issues happen because I think when I was doing it, I was really tired, so
I wasn't paying attention to different things going on, but the main issue, which I seem
to run into every time I do Tailwind and totally forgot about it in this particular case, is
it got configured with V3 syntax, but it was a version for Tailwind.
So in the last story, you would have seen the styling, and I said it was pretty normal.
That should be what it's like, and you might have noticed in the last story that there
was styling that looked pretty average, and I said, well, that's actually how it's meant
to be.
Well, that's not the case, and the reason is that the Tailwind styling was misconfigured
and it took a little while to find it out.
Another issue that was happening under the hood for me is that one of the servers, there
are two in this, was meant to be running on 5173, but Claude was actually running a separate
one on 5174, and so I was trying to see updates, and nothing was coming through, and I kept
saying to Claude, this is not working, and he kept saying, I fixed it, but I wasn't seeing
anything visually.
Now again, a lot of that was me tired at the time, but this is one of the realities of
having AI agents that can run the servers for you, is that if they've got a conflict
with your current server, then it's just going to spawn a new one on a different port.
Then it had a bunch of issues with the bubbles, and the drop-down menu that we saw showing
up underneath the bubbles.
Now the reason I actually wrote this document wasn't just so that I could show you the sort
of challenges that you can run into, but because once you write a document like this, you can
make it a part of your documentation system, so if any other issues happen in the future
and you notice it, you can say, can you go and read other documentation or lessons learnt
that were done in the past, and this can be a perfect way of training the AI model to
write code the right way if you see a certain problem showing up again and again.
