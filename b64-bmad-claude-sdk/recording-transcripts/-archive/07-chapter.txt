Now you may notice when you start with a clean Claude code is that the context is empty and
so certain things it doesn't know about.
So this idea of do you have a project brief, which we just worked on, is something it doesn't
currently know about.
So I'm just going to put in one, that's what we want to do, and I'll put in the at sign
and start typing brief.
And we'll just press enter so it'll use that as loaded context.

so it's read in the brief I've read it everything seems okay to me so I'm just
going to press 1 and continue on that notice as it goes it creates a change
log so we've got version 1 which is the initial PRD created from the project
brief and now we get into the hearts of what a product requirements document is
we're coming up with the functional requirements as we go so FR1 would be
the first functional requirement so it's listing all the basic capabilities
that this application is going to do and then after that it does the non
functional requirements which is all abstractions or ideas that the system's
going to work on such as the line limit on the server the fact that we're going
to use Claude auth to log into the system now like with the interactive mode
with product brief we could just move on to the next section but it's got a
couple of areas needing validation is 200 lines realistic and should we have
pre-built examples so I'm just going to make a simple adjustment here it says
the 200 is a suggestion what I'm trying to do is have the actual event loop of
the agent be fairly small and contained there's not a lot that you need to do
there but this is a guideline it's not a limit at all what I wanted to ensure
that it does is not create complex structures as it builds out this system
because there's nothing complex about the Claude code event loop the other
thing I wanted to do is not general the other thing I wanted to talk about is
this area or should we have a pre-built example application no we shouldn't this
is all vibe coding that we're going to ask people to do but we may actually
create some examples later on so we'll just press the enter on that and so the
functional requirements have been updated we've removed a concept and
we've done slight updates and so this is a lot more important than in the brief
to get this right so we'll move on to the next step but the idea is that this
is what's actually going to get built

Now the user interface design guides have come through. I've read through all
of this and most of it was good except there was one area and probably the
core area which is the screens and this is not working the way I'm thinking. So
the first thing it says is chat interface primary screen full height chat
with message history input field streaming indicator and example
starters. Love that. That is the only thing that I saw this initial
application having. It's then got concept of a status panel shows active story
recent file operations quality gate status. Now that's more complexity than I
need. It's also talking about the generated application preview in public
again more complexity than I actually need. My thoughts were that as soon as
you started typing stuff in here you could generate data in the back end you
could generate HTML in the back end and now that doesn't necessarily mean the
menus would work but the actual pages should work and this also pointed out
another area the quality gate status. So I have this plan in this I had a plan
for this particular application that be mad stories would get generated that's
what the quality gates were but then I've taken it out made it a future thing. So
if we go to the very bottom I said this section here doesn't make sense anymore
and I've listed it. I said the next two and then I've said the next two steps
which are these ones down here which I've copied from above are two complex
and I've given it a little bit more clarity on what to do so we'll just run
with that. Again it's so important in this area that you actually get it
stating exactly what you think you want to see. So it's come through red is what
it's changing green is what it's changing it to. Now you can see it's
continuing with simplified user interface but we can also go over to
Visual Studio and have a look at the document like before here in a simple
markdown viewer so be mad Claude self-editing application we've got our
functional requirements kicking into place here and we can see some of the
modifications like the slash chat and the slash products as examples. So we go
back to our conversation and this makes a whole lot more sense we've got the
application presents as a minimal chat interface we can see it's on slash chat
we know that it can generate concepts like products and blogs we know it can
generate concepts like products and blogs even though there may not be a
navigation menu in place. The one little bit of styling we'll have is that it can
do dark mode and light mode and so we can move on to the next step there is
one big issue in here and this is the issue of anyone using vibe coding is
that this application when we build it will allow us to change our backend
server. Now that's both a security issue you wouldn't do this on a public website
this is an internal tool but it means how do we manage those changes and I'm
assuming in my setup that I'm going to use git commit so I should be able to
roll back but that's not necessarily the most technically easy thing for people
to use but for this example that's how I'm planning to do it. Now here what it's
done is now here what it's done is come up with the technical assumptions
they're all based off the project brief which is great I've read through all of
them and they're all very accurate this is exactly the way I see it happening
but I thought I'd point out one area so where did this all come from it came
from something called the storyline app and so I think it's important to look at
this application for a second for a second because and I think it's
important to look at this application for a second because the catalyst for
this project was how do we create a self-creating documentation system now
I think it's important that we look at the storyline application because the
catalyst for building this project was could we generate stories dynamically on
the fly so if we head over to a web view and we're looking at what is a
client and server sort of system so currently we are connected to the server
and it's using the same technology we're about to build and if we go and have a
look at our project files we've got something called the boy and the Baker
now the boy and the Baker is a five-minute video that we've created and
when you look at it you can see that it's a story and the story starts off
with an elderly Baker walks into his shop to see a boy being beaten and
bullied by some younger children so we can see pictures of this Baker along the
way now if we go and toggle the image display we can see that we've got an
establishing shot we've also got other versions of the shot available so as we
move through this story and it goes for five minutes all of these images are
character consistent their theme and style consistent and using tools like
HALU which we make available which we use to animate using a combination of
the image prompts for Dali 3 Sora and the animation prompts for and the so we
build our movie by using the image prompts with tools like Dali 3 and Sora
and we use the animation prompts along the way for doing the animations in
HALU or for doing the animations in HALU or VO3 so what I want to do is but the
interesting thing that but the interesting thing is that everything
that you're seeing is based off this one narrative so we've got a little
narrative it creates setting the ambience the characters the description
we've got the image prompt and we've got the animation prompt and I've been
going through and refactoring this so that this is a lot more deeper but
really I just want to type this into a text box and have all of this extra
information generated for me automatically and so when we get back to
this particular application that we're building that's exactly what this is
meant to do save something and data gets generated and that's what this
application is meant to do we should just be able to save something into a
text box and have complex data structures form around that information
