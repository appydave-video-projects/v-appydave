So one of the things that we have to do before we actually start the first story
for epic number three is we just need to do a little bit of a retrospective so
I've got a basic question just asking it to think about what it would need to do
a retrospective and it's come up with a long list of tasks that it should
perform to build up that particular document. I've specifically told it to
think deeply and I've also given it as much time as it needs to do a detailed
job and so it goes through and it writes this long document and we don't have to
read the document but I think one of the key points here is that it also has
recommendations for epic 3 so whenever we're doing a story in epic 3 it'll
have information here that it can pull on it will have information here that it
can pull on to help do a better story it will have information from here that
it can pull on when generating the stories for epic 3
