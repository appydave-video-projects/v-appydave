We've just finished story 2.5 which is the ability to write information to the different
data files.
I've done a few use cases but let's go through the individual changes that have happened.
So from the AppyDave workflow point of view there's a little bit of an improvement because
on load it has a look through to see what the last story was that was done and suggest
the next story to go and write.
So I've just put in 2.5 here.
So it's created the story really quickly but the challenge I had with the last story 2.4
was that we added a couple of new tools that was the ListJson and the PreviewJson.
And so what I did at the time of validation which is the next thing, I then asked it,
I then gave it some extra context by talking about the List and PreviewJson from the previous
story and also giving it a little bit of a use case.
So I was able to talk through the capabilities it could already see with adding JSON.
But then it went on to document a bunch of critical gaps which is exactly what we want.
We want it to pick up old ideas, bring them into the new story and make it available for
the development.
So it gave me a bunch of options.
I went with number one that's just fix or update the story.
So we're seeing new information being added to the story and that allowed us to go into
developing with the new capabilities thought of along the way.
And then when it wrote the SAT plan, one of the things it did automatically this time
this because I'm gradually improving agents and workflows as we go is that it did the
automated tests of the terminal commands.
But I did ask it to run it one more time and just give me a summary of what's going on
so we can see the eight tests that are from the terminal are all working.
And then it started listing eight different tests that I as the human could go and test
and the steps to work on them.
Now the first one actually failed.
And the failure was simply that it wrote the JSON document out in quote marks so as a string.
So I let it know that there was an issue there, quickly found and rectified that particular
problem.
Then I ran into a new problem which didn't end up being a bug but just a gap in the requirements
and you can see the basic idea here is that I had a conversation that said add sugar for
50 cents.
Now I said that statement after a prior statement of looking in the products table.
So I assumed contextually it would just work.
And the issue is that it had no conversational memory each time it went back to the SDK, each
time it went back to the agent SDK.
So it suggested we could either fix it or create a new story.
So what I've done is added a new story to this epic called 2.7 just based directly off
the information right here.
So I just asked it to update the epic with a 2.7 story which is not the same as a regular
story that we create.
It's a bit summarized when it's inside the epic.
So the ability to have conversational memory in the system will be...
So the ability to have conversational memory is something we'll do in two stories time.

So let's test the idea of adding and updating files in the data folder. We've
got a test products we can see the information that's here we've got one
broken file as well and we'll come over and say can you add a product we want
sugar and we want it to be 50 cents. After that we'll just go down to our use
cases and we've got this create an electronics JSON document under the
catalog folder so it'll be a nested file and it's saying it will do it with a
laptop and a phone. Now we'll head down to our JSON document we can see that
this is expanded to have sugar at 50 cents looks like we've got our new file
let's just drag that in we've got an electronics catalog and we've got
multiple items coming in here and they're quite detailed. Now let's try out
a couple of discovery commands so we'll go what JSON exists in the data
directory let's see what comes through we can see the broken and the test
products we don't have the catalog so it hasn't looked deeply but what we'll do
is we'll add a category field to the test products table so click that center
agent it's telling us it'll add a category now it's done it and if we
head over to VS code we can now see that on products we've got these categories
so we got groceries over here and there was a couple of other interesting use
cases that all worked which I didn't even think of it just created these and
the ability to create a file outside of the data directory was blocked creating
a file with circular references we'll do that because that was interesting so a
new file called test has just been created and it just talks about here's
node one next is no two and while it's tried to do it it's come up with a nice
message saying that this is something that can't be done with the JSON format
and the last useful example is to just add five items and array to a new table
so here we have five sites added so what we're seeing now is this really
powerful mechanism where we can read we can write we can update we can work with
sub directory we can work with subdirectories of files back on our
server now these are data files next we'll be looking at how we can do HTML
files but the whole idea of this is more for an internal tool I wouldn't it's not
the sort of tool that we would use up on a public website where it can write to
your server but if you're trying to build a little application for yourself
and you want the ability to dynamically update data just by talking into the
microphone then this is a perfect technique that we can be using
