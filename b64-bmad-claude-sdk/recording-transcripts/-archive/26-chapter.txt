So that brings us to the end of EPIC 2 and what we can now do is we can add
products or any sort of data that we like we can update it we can also play
around with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and we could call this a complete application
but if we look at what EPIC number 3 is going to be about we'll be able to give
the chat interface a much needed upgrade and we'll do it by going to react we'll
use and we'll do that by going to react where we'll use Vite, ShadCN, Tailwind, CSS
and we'll use the Versel AI elements to give a really clean chat interface. Now
it's a fairly simple EPIC we're going to initialize the react application then
we're going to install the ShadCN and configure Tailwind CSS then we'll build
the chat interface again using Versel AI elements and lastly we'll implement a
simple dark mode, light mode, total.

So one of the things that we have to do before we actually start the first story
for epic number three is we just need to do a little bit of a retrospective so
I've got a basic question just asking it to think about what it would need to do
a retrospective and it's come up with a long list of tasks that it should
perform to build up that particular document. I've specifically told it to
think deeply and I've also given it as much time as it needs to do a detailed
job and so it goes through and it writes this long document and we don't have to
read the document but I think one of the key points here is that it also has
recommendations for epic 3 so whenever we're doing a story in epic 3 it'll
have information here that it can pull on it will have information here that it
can pull on to help do a better story it will have information from here that
it can pull on when generating the stories for epic 3
