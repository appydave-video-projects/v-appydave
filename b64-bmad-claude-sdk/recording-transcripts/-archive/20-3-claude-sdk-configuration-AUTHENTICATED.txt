So at the moment the 2.1 story is finished. If we go and look at the main
story acceptance test that we need to look for it's just that we've got
colored timestamp with the agent SDK running successfully. If we go down to
our terminal we can see that entry just here. So from a terminal point of view
the server seems to be working. All of our acceptance tests have worked and the
big one is that the new test tool that I added is also returning and the little
test tool that was created is also returning valid data that the
authentication is working.
