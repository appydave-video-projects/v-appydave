So the create project brief is going to read from our project reference and what
it does is it uses commands like the create doc which is based on a template
already in the BMAD core and for this we're going to work in the interactive
mode so we'll just press 1. YOLO would be the fast way to do it and with my
project documentation it could just work out perfectly but I want to be pretty
sure with this. So notice that the output file is going to be docs brief and we
can see that it's working through many to-dos currently it's written the
executive summary for it and I've read it through it's all pretty perfect I
think the target market says it all it's developers learning AI agent
integration and self-modifying systems it's for technical educators that's
what I do where I want to generate systems that are a bit flexible and
dynamic pretty quickly that's also rapid prototyping that's what we're doing
today and then we've got the BMAD method practitioners now one thing is to know
that I'll be testing this with version 6 BMAD and maybe other systems as well in
the future if there is anything you want me to test it with just let me know and
if there is anything you want me to test it with let me know in the comments
below but for now we'll just proceed to the next section and the good thing is
it started writing the briefs and the good thing is it started writing the
brief and the good thing is it started writing the brief so we'll just bring up
Visual Studio and click on this file here and so as it goes we can keep track
of what's going on the left-hand side but let's take a look at this problem
but let's have a look at this problem statement that it's come up with so
reading through the problem statement everything's pretty good one of the
things I notice is the database this is where this application will be a little
different to a lot of applications it won't have a database instead it's just
going to have JSON documents JSOM they're going to be stored in the server
and for saving them it's just going to be committed to a repository now this is
not a normal application that you would run in the cloud I guess but for me it
helps me create high-performing but for me it allows me to rapidly create tools
that I use locally on my computer through a web interface so I think we
can just move on to the next section and what it will start doing is writing an
updated brief we should see it pop in below it's updating so we can see a
whole new green section and here it is listed in the markdown document now if
there was anything out of whack with it rather than using Claude to change it
you might just manually come in and alter the document here to have any
rectify to rectify any flaws that you notice it's important that you do
rectify it's important also that you do rectify flaws because these propagate
through if you fix it now you have less issues in the future so the next area
we're going to work on is the proposed solution section so it's written the
proposed solution if we go over and have a look we can see that it's going
to use an express JavaScript server embedded into it will be a Claude
agent SDK backend some of the tools that we'll have is the ability to read and
write JSON files and also to write HTML files the main front-end technology is
that we'll use react with socket IO so that we can stream information live and
we're going to use be mad method version 4 to integrate everything there's also a
little note there's also a little note here about using shad CN for the user
interface we might also use the first cell AI elements now now the backend is
meant to be simple just about 200 lines of code and one of the key requirements
is that I can just use it with my max account from Claude I don't need to go
and pay any API costs with this particular tool now while that's been
happening in the background it's been setting up the target users we'll get
it to start writing that brief for us once it's done the target users section
it should move on automatically to the goals and success metrics all I've had
to do each time is basically say the next number for it to save the file so
the target users have been updated it should go directly into the next area
but if we have a look at the target users we can see that it's a learning
system for developers but I would argue that this is for anyone that wants to
learn vibe engineering so context engineering but I would argue that it's
for anyone that wants to learn context engineering which is partly about
building applications but it's about building any system in a business or in
your personal workflows this is also an area that you could pull out at because
I think anyone should be able to learn this one of the things about what we're
doing is that we're not writing any code ourselves everything is just
understanding a little bit of architecture following a plan and using
natural language processes the entire way so now it's about to create the
goals and success metrics we've already written all the target user information
it reads the brief each time it does what it needs to do and then writes the
brief again and you might be wondering what does it need to do how does it know
to do that and this is just one of the internal mechanisms of the BMAD method
so now the KPIs or the key performance indicators have been updated we can go
look at it while we move on to the next section one of the things I would
suggest is in this case they're not that useful for me I don't really care about
these numbers here thousand developers clone or fork the repository not
important to me content amplification if people use it I'd be really happy about
that I guess if anything was important is that people are using a sound content
engineering system which is BMAD method and that I'm being seen as a thought
leader in this particular area but this is but quite frankly this section is a
bit of fluff today for us but the next area is really important and this is the
minimum viable product and so as a must-have it's working on the idea of it
having three epics now this is not normal by the way this is not the normal
area to put in epics usually we do that after we've done the architecture and the
PRD and it comes later but I put this specifically into my planning documents
because I'm thinking of this as a simple application with three different areas
that we need to do we need a foundation that's the server the client it just
needs to be set up after that the back end is the main area that we want to
work on and it's fairly simple I want it to be quite small and contained I've
already documented the concept I've already documented the concept of a core
event loop I've already documented the concept of a core event loop this is the
main thing that I want it to do whether it be in Python or JavaScript is kind of
irrelevant I've written it in what is domain specific language basically human
readable information so for epic 2 which is the Claude agent SDK
implementation I want it to be very simple and what I've done ahead of time
now for the Claude agent SDK implementation I've already done what's
called a core loop or the event loop documentation and essentially this is
just a human readable list it's not written in a specific coding language it
should work no matter what target language this system is built for now
we are going for JavaScript and hopefully that'll translate pretty
readily and then the third area is that we're going to have a beautiful user
interface so this is basically using the Vercel and ShadCN and Tailwind CSS
and just getting it to talk to the backend with streams and as that
information hits the SDK perform any data creation or web page designs as we
go and the next section of the MVP is what not to do so we don't need a
database we don't need multi-tenancy multi-user we don't need authentication
or authorization we don't need model context protocol good thing about using
BMAD is that I've used it for enterprise applications really effectively so it
can do all of these but we're keeping it out of the example so after that we're
going to build the post MVP or the post minimum viable product vision and we can
see that it's already come up with most of that it's got different tools that
we might want to add later on and additional areas like multi-agent
workflows production release now quite frankly I could maybe delete all of this
and be happy because I'm not planning to go further with this particular project
it's going to be the foundation for other tools that you'll see me creating
using the BMAD method so it's gone off and now thought about the technical
considerations they've all been set up it feels that we need to use react
version 19 and if we look at it in the markdown it's TypeScript and Vite, ShadCN,
UI, Tailwind, CSS and socket IO client this is all for the front end if we look
a bit further we've got the back end which is an express server we've got an
installation of the agent SDK planned we're going to communicate between the
two systems with socket IO and we're running it on node for our database it's
just going to be some JSON documents in the data directory future we could use
a database if we like and the hosting is it's just planned to run on localhost
so with that we can go and look at the next section it's currently working on
the constraints and assumptions so this was a big thing for me is it going to
cost me anything no I want it to hook into my max account and that should be
how it works developer time 40 to 60 hours for the MVP I don't think that's
accurate hopefully this is only going to be a three hour process at most it'll
just be made by me let's look at those key assumptions so Claude SDK BMAD
version 4 a bit of fluff in here but from a technology point of view
everything is pretty tried and tested the next area it's working on is the
risk and open questions we'll read that in a moment but notice that I just keep
moving on to the next section while this is working away so we can see here it's
about to update the document and there it is it'll be moving on to the
appendices system but let's go and look at the risk and open questions and this
is really useful I've never done the agent SDK so it is a dependency with
high risk for me when I'm doing this video the constraint I think that the
statement here could be true but I don't think it matters it's not a it's not
that I have to do it in 200 lines of code it's just that I don't want it to be
complex that's kind of why I'm doing the constraint I will talk about this
section briefly I took out a section called the BMAD quality gates what I
wanted to have happen is that rather than pure vibe coding where the user says
I would like a new home page I wanted it to actually create a BMAD story on the
back end now I think for this demonstration it's maybe a reach goal
maybe we'll do it but this would be a really powerful idea that users could
just sit on the front end and say I want a new capability and BMAD at the other
end hears that and says well let me create a story for you and then the
developer can go off and create it but for today I've taken it out so we're at
the final stages we're about to build the appendices and it says we've got
content information about the SDK BMAD version 4 we've got our technology
stack validation in place we've got a competitive analysis now interestingly
with that competitive analysis it we haven't written anything per se and
interestingly with that competitive analysis it hasn't really done one we've
got a little bit of information so let's compare what we're doing to what's out
there now if you don't ever want to get your hands dirty with code these are two
that you could use bubble and web flow work in a low code system it's all drag
and drop this is pretty good but I like having a little bit of control of the
stack we can use different AI coding assistance like copilot and cursor but
since I found Claude code I see no reason to go back to these IDE based
systems I do like using codecs I do like using Claude code a lot so that's where
we're staying then we've got agent framework so these are low-level AI
language there's a low-level AI library so we've got Lang chain auto GPT this is
more complex than we need to do for what this application is and I'm assuming
that this will be the very first example of doing Claude SDK with BMAD because
it's quite a new framework itself so as the rest of the BMAD workflow is
happening there's also links to various files that I've created plus external
resources so that's the docs brief finish you notice it's now saying to go
on to the next agent it's got everything written what we're going to
do is exit out because what I'd like to do is have a clean context the next time
we start but while we're looking at that let's just see what that last section
was so we've got the next step immediate action is we're going to create the
product requirements document we're going to do that by loading the project
manager agent and running the create PRD command let's also look at what
we've got in our system so everything that you see on the left in planning is
stuff I've done ahead of time so the only one document we have in the system
specifically created by BMAD is the brief so next step create
