So at this point we're right at the very end of the epic so number one is done
we've done stories one two three and four from the epic now at this point we
might want to do a retrospective this is something that you would do in agile
development I recently talked about that in a video so this video here how to
make your AI coding partner smarter was an AI retrospective that I did a few
months ago on BMAD this has now been implemented into BMAD so you'll see that
in the version 6 once that's available otherwise you can watch this video to
see how it works but for today we'll end that and then move on to epic but for
now we will just move straight on to epic number two
