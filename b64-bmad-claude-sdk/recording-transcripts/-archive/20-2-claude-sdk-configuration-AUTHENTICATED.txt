So I ran into a couple of problems doing authentication and apparently I was on
the wrong version of Claude so what I've done is an update and I'm going to take
you through the workflow as it stands I've just logged in to 2.0.42 and I'm
just going to do a logout so this ensures that we are now out of Claude
and down below I have this little command that I've run and down below I've
created a little test SDK script we'll just run that and it should fail so
we're seeing an SDK fail and we're seeing it SDK and we're seeing an SDK
test fail because we're not logged in so what we'll do is we'll come back up here
and we'll run the login function and we'll say yes and yes we're using the
browser subscription we're using our browser subscription so we can just come
up and click on the authorize button we'll come back to the terminal it says
we're signed in so let's clear this and try it again and it's just going to say
hello in exactly five words and hopefully it gets something back and so
now we can see that our SDK is actually working
