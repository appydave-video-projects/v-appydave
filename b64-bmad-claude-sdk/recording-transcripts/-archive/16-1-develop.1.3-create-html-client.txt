So what I've done is started a new cloud code we've gone over to the scrum master
we started drafting story 1.3 so it's finished creating the story it's put it
into the 1.2 story right here we've got a bunch of we've got a bait we've got a
bunch of basic information here but let's head over to visual studio I've
already set it to ready I think after it gets through the tasks the main thing
that we're going to want to look at is the fact that there's now a HTML page so
we should be able to see something apparently there's going to be a little
bit of JavaScript going on so let's go back and start developing so I'm just
letting it load up the developer and once that's done we can just develop
story 1.3 so now the development is finished it looks like we're going to
have an index file that we can go and look at we'll do the SAT soon but let's
just go over to the QA bot for a moment and we'll run our review on 1.3 while
that's running we'll just do a quick check of the document it says all the
tasks done there should be a public directory we've got the HTML index we've
got script tags coming through in a moment we should see an update to the
QA results we're also going to see a new gate file added here so the QA results
are in we've got a new gate file we can see the story we will check an SAT soon
there's updates to the packages the client application now has a the client
application now has an index HTML page going on we've got a new server file and
if we close it down we've also got a public folder which I think is where
it's going to serve up static files so let's go and test our story acceptance
bot so if we type in so let's go and test our story acceptance spot we should
be able to type in SAT and we've got SAT so currently Taylor is loading into
memory we've got a create SAT command available we've also got an update SAT
command now we'll kick off the create and this command this one here that we
haven't used yet is just in case I don't like the instructions that the current
bot has we've got the ability to update the bot so this is reading out SAT is
reading the story that's going to be the source of truth it's also looking at
some of the code that's been created like the client index HTML and at the
end of this we should have a new file just sitting next to 1.3 story so it's
just created it let's pop it open so the story itself was about creating a basic
HTML page and the human test that we can do requires us to run the server which
I've just done and then it wants to go to the chat window and we should see a
BMAD plus Claude SDK test client we should see a blue header called client
server communication test let's just bring it up how that looks like it and
it's also got a text input box saying enter a message optional yep that's in
case that's in place and blue button labeled test the health expert and a
blue button labeled test health endpoint it's also saying gray response area with
test response will go here I wonder if it works now we'll come back to having a
look at our form we've got some things around styling I'm not that concerned
about that what's this form submission without a page reload should just say
server status response should just say server response status is okay and
apparently there's no page reload so we'll bring up our website and we'll
click on test endpoint and there wasn't a refresh but we did see the server
response update apparently there's a bonus visual test we can stop the
server which I've just done and if we click on test health endpoint we get
found to fetch make sure the server is running so that's really cool I wasn't
planning to create the SAT agent as part of this video but this is the idea of it
is that you don't have to think about what the code did it tells you what has
happened and tells you how to reproduce it which is which just saves you a heap
of time when you're using the be mad method to develop an application we'll
come back to our terminal where I was running that server and we'll just clean
up after ourselves so we'll do a bit of a commit right now and we've got a great
commit message everything's listed we can just push this code right here and
now we just exit out and go on to the next
