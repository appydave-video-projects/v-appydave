So now we're moving on to EPIC 2, which is all about setting up the Anthropic Claude SDK.
And it talks about, let's get it installed. Seems like a good first step.
After that, it's trying to implement one of the tools, which is the read JSON.
Then it's going to do the write JSON and the write file.
And then after all of that, we're going to integrate socket streaming.
And we're going to do it both for the server, but we're also going to have the chat messages working with this.
And then after that, we're going to implement the full event loop.
Now it's this particular EPIC that I'm having a few challenges with.
And I'll go over what they are soon and how I can change them pretty quickly.
But let's look at the third EPIC.
