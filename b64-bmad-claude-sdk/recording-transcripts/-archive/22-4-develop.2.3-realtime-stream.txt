So the last test is what would happen if we bombarded it with ideas so I'm going
to put in number 10 and we'll press enter then we'll paste and we'll put 20
and we'll paste and we'll put 100 and then we'll paste and we'll do 10 again
and we can see that counting to 10 this is what it's come up with count to 20
it's done that for us count to 20 and notice things are starting to get a
little bit out of order so it's basically as the information comes in
is when it's written to the stream and what I notice about this that is that it
works very much similar to how Claude code would work which is different to
chat GPT where you actually have to wait for each response to come through now I
don't personally know whether the way with Claude code if I was to rapid-fire
prompts like this they kind of get aggregated and you get really
interesting you you can put in an idea and then follow it up with a change of
idea and it takes it into account don't think that's happening here but we've
got the rudimentary ideas of what you can already do with Claude code or
working
