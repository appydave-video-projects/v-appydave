Now you can see that the architecture is complete and it's suggesting that we're
ready to go into the first epic but what we're going to do is just prepare the
files a little bit so we'll exit out and we'll clear our system and go back into
Claude. Now I'm just going to go into the PM and we're just going to ensure that
we've still got alignment between the PRD and the architecture because PRD was
created before the architecture. So I've just told John the PM to check that the
architecture document and the PRD are in alignment. Main thing I want to ensure is
that the PRD is still in the right order based on the architecture. I also want to
see if any of the stories or the epics or anything needs to change based on
what we did with the architecture. If you're using version 6 of the
BMAD method this is called Solutioning. It's just something I tend to do
manually because I found it effective in the past.
