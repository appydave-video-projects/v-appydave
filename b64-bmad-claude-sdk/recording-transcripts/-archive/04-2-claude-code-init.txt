So with those two statements what we can see is that we're improving the
Claude MD to prioritize the BMAD workflow. So what is Claude MD? That's
essentially the system prompt. So it's available every time we do a prompt that
anything in this file will be used and we want it to be hyper focused on what
it does. So anything in red has been removed and that's a lot of the stuff
that I did in pre-planning before this video. We can see that my folder hierarchy
that does exist has been removed from the system prompt but the important
stuff that it's a self editing application is in place that the core of
the server should only be about 200 lines of code. It's got a very clean
understanding of what the BMAD workflow is. So we've got the workflow primary
path, we've got step one which is installation. Now we've already done
that. We've got step two which will be the analyst agent doing a workflow init
and it just keeps going doing this hyper focused system prompt and at the end
what we've got and at the end what we've got is a clear project status with the
pre-implementation mentioned. We've got workflow task priorities in place, we've
got the architecture overview, implementation concepts and just some
labeling reference only that we have planning document and so Claude is ready
to work with the installation which we've already done and I'm going to
just make the statement I've already completed the installation and that I
wanted to move on to whatever the first step is which I believe is the research
agent. Now it's come up and said what we'll probably need to do is the
workflow init so we'll run that. You might be wondering why it's already
pre-answered some questions here and that's because I've already got an
execution guide that I've done before the video but normally these are the
sorts of answers we'd want to fill in so let's just do the workflow init and see
what happens.
