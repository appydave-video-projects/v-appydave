Now we're on to story 2.4 which is all about reading the JSON document and you
can see that I've done a basic test here we can see the conversation finding
information on the computer it's got three sample products in place and if we
jump down to the conversation it started as usual with the new Appy Day of
Workflow we've got 2.4 being the story that we want to run. It created that
story and then I just typed in continue. This moved on to validating the file
that gave a 9.5 out of 10 and the little issues that were there were all dealt
with pretty cleanly during the development phase so we didn't need to do
anything. Once I then set the status to develop we were able to come in and
click on the developed story we've got a new path validator and the tool that
will read the JSON. It also set up some sample data automatically so we had
some test products in place we also had some broken data that we could test
which we also have broken data which we haven't done a test case on just yet.
Next it built the story acceptance test based off the story and the code that
we've developed. It also ran for me all the automated tests that it could do
anything that was to do with the terminal or something that could be run
from a command. Now during the SAT generation it also generated a couple of
files that were very unexpected there was this human test there was also a
quick test and also because I've done QA there was another file called dash QA
so one of the things I had to do was go through and ensure that so what I had to
do was let it know that the SAT agent that we had created earlier in this
project probably has some flaws and if it could go through and rectify them at
the same time as cleaning up these files and putting them in the correct location.
And this is a sort of bespoke issue that you can get from time to time as soon as
you see an anomaly as soon as you see something out of the ordinary with the
BMAD method it's important that you probably fix it in the moment and let
the system know either through learning documents or you clawed MD or in this
case an agents file that it's not quite right can it go and update itself and so
we can see right here that the create SAT agent or workflow so we can see
right here that the create SAT task has been updated with new instructions and
the cleanup of unnecessary files has happened right here. Now at this point to
get the JSON loading in from the tool calling we had a few different
challenges to work through the first one was to do now initially I had a
little bit of a challenge getting it to read the JSON documents firstly it had
the wrong folder we changed that then it had a little permission issue change
that but then the big issue kicked in and that it was trying to read a doc now
initially when it went to read the JSON document the big problem it was having
is I'd say could you go and load in some products and it wouldn't pick the right
file firstly it had a directory issue that was a slight request to the dev
now when we went to read the products now when I went to read the JSON using
the AI agent there were a couple of problems that needed to use the
development agent to fix the first one was a little permission issue it
rectified that really quickly based off documentation then there was the wrong
folder it got that fixed up as soon as I gave it an example of where I was
trying to read and where the files actually were and then lastly which was
the hardest one was that we were implementing this concept of read JSON
but it didn't have any ability to figure out what JSON documents were available
or to discover the one you actually wanted so it suggested and then quickly
built two extra tools the list would show any files that were available and
the preview would let you interrogate them and and the preview would let the
agent interrogate the files to figure out which one you actually wanted

So, let's go and test the read system. We've got our little products document and we've
also got a broken document. And we'll just head over to our site and we'll say, can you
get me a list of products? We'll send that to the agent. It's processing at the moment.
I'll help you get a list of products first. Let's discover them. I've found some products.
Let me read them. And it's got the file. And look at that. It's got the AppyDave on school.
So it's got that file that we just updated.

And we'll see if this test against the broken JSON document will work, we'll say can you
get a list of items from broken, and it's doing some processing at the moment.
It's found that we have a broken JSON document, let's read it.
And this is perfect, it's giving a nice message that the data is malformed and the system
is not falling over.
