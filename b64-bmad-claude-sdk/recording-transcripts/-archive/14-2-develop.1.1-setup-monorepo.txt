Now you might notice at the end of the story there's an area for the QA agent, so what
we can do is go back over, type in slash QA for the quality assurance agent.
Now this is not an agent I would normally use in my own projects, but I have custom
agents more for story acceptance testing and that's about generating a document for the
human to work through and test different things that would be visual in nature.
For this video we'll use the QA agent and we'll just do a review on 1.1.
Now I mentioned that I'd normally do a story acceptance test plan, now that doesn't preclude
doing normal tests as well.
So usually when you're developing an application you want to have unit tests, you might want
to have end-to-end tests, but definitely you need some sort of a test plan at the end of
the story that says these are the things that you have to go and look at.
And in a more complex application I like it to actually walk me through and say first click
on this menu, fill in this piece of information.
And all of this information can be derived from a story and if it was something I was
doing with this project the way it would look is that it would create a new file right next
to the story, so we've got 1.1.story, but I would also have a 1.1.story-sat.
I would have a 1.1.story-sat and in that would be all the guidance and instructions for me
to go and visually check that everything's working.
Now currently we can see that the QA agent has come in, it's started to update the document.
So we now have our overall quality assessment in place, everything seems to be okay.
And one of the interesting statements is this one right here, so it's just talking about
future considerations, that'll be important with new stories.
Now if we go back to our VS Code we can see that the story has been updated with all this
extra quality assurance checks.
