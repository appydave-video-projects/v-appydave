So to resolve this problem I could have a conversation here but what I find
easier is to just start selecting the context we need. What I've done is copied
all the way up to when the epic first started. At this point I just select that
put in the clipboard. After that I just like to open a new conversation which
I've got down below and I've started it with the statement I want you to read
and absorb the following information and then wait for me for guidance. And that
complete epic list has been pasted in. So that new conversation knows what we've
got. We've got it highlighted in blue and I just tell it that you're going to help me
build up an instruction that we can put back into the previous conversation. So
the goal of this conversation is purely to build a prompt to paste into this
conversation. Now that it knows the goal for the conversation what I want to tell
it is I need a Q&A session with it to say what I think are the issues and I
want it to give me questions to get clarity around the problem. But before we
get started I ask it to do a bit of a Q&A session with me to get clarity
around the problems as I see it. So the first bit of the Q&A session is I tell
it that I'm pretty happy with epic one. I think it's good but I think there's
stuff that we're going to talk about in epic two that will impact it. So I just
prepare it to know that it can change epic one even though at the moment it's
pretty good. After that I went through epic two and each of the stories and I
just gave it this long diatribe. Now I was just dictating directly into the
microphone. It was writing out everything as we go and so the good thing about
this is it can make it more readable for me. So the first thing it does is start
to unpack the issues that I had addressed. And with that, so these are the
main things it unpacked. It figured out that stories 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4
can't be properly verified until we've done the event loop. It also worked out
that the event loop is not a single story. There's both a beginning and an
incremental development of it before it finishes. It identified from my
conversation that what was called story 2.4 was actually two different concepts.
One was the streaming client area, the other was the same streaming client but
specifically for the agent SDK. And this also led it to understanding that 1.4
might need some modifications. Now because I asked it to do a Q&A system it
actually came up with four pretty solid questions but one of the things I
noticed while reading them was it kind of suggested the answers as it went. So
it's a question of is it asking me questions or does it already have good
recommendations and I just need to sign them off. So I just told it that all of
the answers, all the questions seem okay. So I just told it that the questions
it's asking I already thought it had the answer could you just give me the
recommendation. It just saves me a lot more time than actually engaging in the
Q&A. And so it wrote these recommendations so the minimum viable
event loop after 2.1 becomes this idea of create a basic event loop and there's
no tooling, no streaming, there's just the fact that it can receive messages from
the SDK. At the moment at the end of EPIC 1 we're just doing HTTP requests but it
thinks that it might be useful to put in some socket functionality at that point.
It now feels that the event loop that we're building is a bunch of capabilities
that can be done as multiple stories mostly here in 2.4 to 2.6 and we can
move the tools that we want to do into 2.4 to 2.6 and when I look at that I
realize that even before we move on to EPIC 3 if I want to build in other
capabilities like Claude skills this EPIC will be the right way to go because
it's designed in such a way that each new, because it's designed in such a way
that each cross-cutting concern or aspect can be added one at a time later
on if needed. So it's already figured out a much better plan but remember that the
initial part of this conversation was can you create the instruction for me. So
I just tell it down the bottom here and I'll press enter that this is perfect. I
love the way it's thinking. What it needs to do is now create those
instructions that we want to put back into the top conversation and just so
you know that top conversation is this one that's here we're going to take
whatever comes out of this conversation and drop it straight into here to
modify it. So here's our detailed instruction set we can just go all the
way to the bottom with this we'll make a copy of it come up here and paste it in
203 lines of information just by asking a couple of questions. So it's already
started working on things one of the interesting things is it's also playing
around with the product requirements document right here. So the changes we
asked for have been implemented we've got a change to story 1.4 and we've got
a whole new re-ordering and breaking up of EPIC 2 and what the number of
stories really tell us is how many development sessions are going to go on
because we'll get the scrum master and the developer to work on each story's
sequential. We'll get the scrum master and the developer to work on each of the
stories sequentially starting from one and going through to number 14. So
quickly looking at the PRD we've got the new EPIC list it's the monorepo set up
the agents or the server in the back end and the front end client and then we've
got all the details coming through one story at a time. These are just simple
stories they'll be converted into full-blown stories with the scrum master
and we can see the main breakup that I needed which is to start off with an
event loop not finish with an event loop and then add streaming and logging as we
go and then after that we can do the tools and finally finish off and then
finally connect it all up to the react front end.
