So our agent SDK application is built and this is what it can do for us. So
we're going into the chatbot where we're going to enter in some products. We
should be able to view those products and see that they've been stored in the
back end. At any time we should be able to create a HTML page. Notice that
there's a live activity, there's also live pages. If we click on the pages we
should be able to go and see the products listing. At any time then we
should be able to add a new product or update it and it should come through
instantaneously. If we need a home page we should be able to add a link and
create a home page. At the same time when we go to that home page we should be
able to navigate back to the products.
