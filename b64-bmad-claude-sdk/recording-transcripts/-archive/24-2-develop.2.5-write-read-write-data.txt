So let's test the idea of adding and updating files in the data folder. We've
got a test products we can see the information that's here we've got one
broken file as well and we'll come over and say can you add a product we want
sugar and we want it to be 50 cents. After that we'll just go down to our use
cases and we've got this create an electronics JSON document under the
catalog folder so it'll be a nested file and it's saying it will do it with a
laptop and a phone. Now we'll head down to our JSON document we can see that
this is expanded to have sugar at 50 cents looks like we've got our new file
let's just drag that in we've got an electronics catalog and we've got
multiple items coming in here and they're quite detailed. Now let's try out
a couple of discovery commands so we'll go what JSON exists in the data
directory let's see what comes through we can see the broken and the test
products we don't have the catalog so it hasn't looked deeply but what we'll do
is we'll add a category field to the test products table so click that center
agent it's telling us it'll add a category now it's done it and if we
head over to VS code we can now see that on products we've got these categories
so we got groceries over here and there was a couple of other interesting use
cases that all worked which I didn't even think of it just created these and
the ability to create a file outside of the data directory was blocked creating
a file with circular references we'll do that because that was interesting so a
new file called test has just been created and it just talks about here's
node one next is no two and while it's tried to do it it's come up with a nice
message saying that this is something that can't be done with the JSON format
and the last useful example is to just add five items and array to a new table
so here we have five sites added so what we're seeing now is this really
powerful mechanism where we can read we can write we can update we can work with
sub directory we can work with subdirectories of files back on our
server now these are data files next we'll be looking at how we can do HTML
files but the whole idea of this is more for an internal tool I wouldn't it's not
the sort of tool that we would use up on a public website where it can write to
your server but if you're trying to build a little application for yourself
and you want the ability to dynamically update data just by talking into the
microphone then this is a perfect technique that we can be using
