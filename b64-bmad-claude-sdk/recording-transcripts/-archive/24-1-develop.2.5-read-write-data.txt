We've just finished story 2.5 which is the ability to write information to the different
data files.
I've done a few use cases but let's go through the individual changes that have happened.
So from the AppyDave workflow point of view there's a little bit of an improvement because
on load it has a look through to see what the last story was that was done and suggest
the next story to go and write.
So I've just put in 2.5 here.
So it's created the story really quickly but the challenge I had with the last story 2.4
was that we added a couple of new tools that was the ListJson and the PreviewJson.
And so what I did at the time of validation which is the next thing, I then asked it,
I then gave it some extra context by talking about the List and PreviewJson from the previous
story and also giving it a little bit of a use case.
So I was able to talk through the capabilities it could already see with adding JSON.
But then it went on to document a bunch of critical gaps which is exactly what we want.
We want it to pick up old ideas, bring them into the new story and make it available for
the development.
So it gave me a bunch of options.
I went with number one that's just fix or update the story.
So we're seeing new information being added to the story and that allowed us to go into
developing with the new capabilities thought of along the way.
And then when it wrote the SAT plan, one of the things it did automatically this time
this because I'm gradually improving agents and workflows as we go is that it did the
automated tests of the terminal commands.
But I did ask it to run it one more time and just give me a summary of what's going on
so we can see the eight tests that are from the terminal are all working.
And then it started listing eight different tests that I as the human could go and test
and the steps to work on them.
Now the first one actually failed.
And the failure was simply that it wrote the JSON document out in quote marks so as a string.
So I let it know that there was an issue there, quickly found and rectified that particular
problem.
Then I ran into a new problem which didn't end up being a bug but just a gap in the requirements
and you can see the basic idea here is that I had a conversation that said add sugar for
50 cents.
Now I said that statement after a prior statement of looking in the products table.
So I assumed contextually it would just work.
And the issue is that it had no conversational memory each time it went back to the SDK, each
time it went back to the agent SDK.
So it suggested we could either fix it or create a new story.
So what I've done is added a new story to this epic called 2.7 just based directly off
the information right here.
So I just asked it to update the epic with a 2.7 story which is not the same as a regular
story that we create.
It's a bit summarized when it's inside the epic.
So the ability to have conversational memory in the system will be...
So the ability to have conversational memory is something we'll do in two stories time.
