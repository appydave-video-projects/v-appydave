So, with our chat agent set up to story 2.6, we'll just put in a simple prompt that says
can you create a HTML page for Appy Dave?
And along with that question, I'll just paste in a little bit of information I just copied
from my website and we'll press enter and see what it does with that.
Now you'll notice as it's building it that we've got this concept down the bottom of
pages, so I've also added a little menu to the bottom of the chat box to show any public
pages that have been created.
So it's just come back with I'll create a HTML page, let me check, I'll create it and
it looks like a bunch of stuff's been created.
And we can see this little index, let's click on that and see what we get.
We've got Appy Dave and this is actually a whole lot of information from my main website.
We'll just pop over and have a look at that and we can see Master AI and Prompt Engineering,
different projects and down the bottom different channels.
So if we come through and look at it here, it looks like it's all the same information.
So that's all been copied over really quickly.
Now behind the scenes, all it's done is created this little HTML file for us and it's put
all the colors in there.
Let's see if we can do something a little bit more complex.
Let's see if we can do something a little bit more complex and we'll do a prompt that
it says, can you create a HTML page called cat-dog and do it talking about a pet store
that is about cats and dogs and let's go with the colors of brown, yellow and green.
So we'll just let this prompt come through as soon as it's typed in.
