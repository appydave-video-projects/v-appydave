Now it started off with this idea of reading the user guide, so we'll take a
copy of that and head over to Visual Studio. Now let's have a look at what I
already had in place. So I already have a dots folder with just this planning
directory. So there's a fair bit of spikes and examples of how this
application could work. We'll draw on that when we're building our product
brief. We've got a Claude file in place, we've got our Claude subfolder
and you'll notice that there's an area called command. So all the BMAD
methods have been set up within this area. And then the rest of BMAD is in
the BMAD core where we've got different workflows, teams, templates for working
through checklists, we've got our agents and we've got this little user guide
that it told us to read. So let's pop that up and you can see we've got a
user guide for a Greenfield document which is what we're doing. We've got a
user guide for the Greenfield project, so this is a brand new project. Brownfield
is for if you've already got an existing code base and we can start with a
project idea. We pretty much know that. It's optional if we do the analyst, we
don't need to because I've got a planning folder but we might. We've got an
optional analyst research. Now we don't need that because I've already done all
the planning but we might just work through it temporarily to see what it
does. Then we've got to build the brief. So with the brief we're doing the
product requirements document, we'll do a bit of UX design, we'll do a little bit
of architecture design and then at the end we'll make it all cohesive. With the
cohesion in place that's when we switch to just development and building epics
and stories. And with the cohesion in place that's where we'll develop and with
the cohesion in place that's when we'll start using a scrub master to design
stories and a developer to actually create the code for those stories.
