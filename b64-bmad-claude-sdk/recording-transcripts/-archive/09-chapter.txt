So I just press one to move forward and we've got our epic list and it looks
like there's going to be three epics which is what I'd suggested it to do
anyway. So we've got the mono repo set up with basic client and server, npm
workspaces, we've got an express server, minimal HTML client, so that looks good.
After that we're really working on the backend which is the agent SDK
integration. It's going to have the three tools that it talked about and then
we're going to polish up the communication. We should already be
working hopefully and then we're going to polish up the communication with the
front-end chat interface here. This is going to use ShadCN and Versel AI agents.
Versel AI elements. So then we've got our sequencing logic. I think the good bit
is the story count. It's listing three to four stories per epic. There isn't a lot
of work in each section. And then it's listed its rationale and decisions. I
read through that. This all seems to make sense for me. So we're moving forward.
I've pressed one and moving on to the next section which is going to be the
epic details and we'll present each epic with all the stories. Now just so you
know it hasn't updated the PRD yet. We're still sitting on the non-functional
requirements and it shouldn't do that until it's got the detail about each
story.

So at this point we've got many stories already set up for different epics. So
let's just look at the epics first. The first one is Monorepo set up with
client and server. So the basic application structure for the front end
talking to the back end. Next we have epic number two which is essentially
setting up the Claude agent SDK so that it can communicate from server through
to the client. And when you look at the goal there's also extra and when you
look at the goal there's also tools included such as talking to JSON and
HTML files. And the final epic, epic number three, is all about building a
react front end and using tools and using libraries like SHAVCN and Tailwind
CSS.

Now if we go back to the top of the epic we'll see that every story follows a
common formula that's designed for agile development so firstly we've got a
story number so in this case it's 1.1 then we've got a simple title for what
the story is going to be about this is initializing the workspace in the mono
repo then we have the Conextra template this is also called a user story and the
original company that came up with this idea worked on the idea that as a being
who is this going to affect what do they want to achieve if the feature was put
in place and if they had achieved it what would it mean to them so the idea
of a user story is this three-part formula that says as a particular person
using the capability what do they want to achieve that's the I want and if they
did achieve it what would they get so that so in this case we've got as a
developer I want to have a properly configured NPN workspace so that I can
develop a server and client application and then there's an acceptance criteria
so this story is considered complete when all of these items are checked off
and this concept is going to repeat all the way through every and this concept
is going to repeat through every story in the epic

So what I'll do now is I'll read through every story headline and then we'll see
pretty quickly that there may be some flaws in the way that it's come up with.
So the first thing it wants to do in the Epic is initialize the NPM workspaces
and Monorepo. That sounds really good. Then it's going to create an express
TypeScript server. After that it's going to get a very basic HTML client up and
running. And finally we're just going to have a little bit of an end-to-end test
and mainly that'll be worked out by starting both servers and checking the
browser logs, checking the console logs. So so far Epic number one looks pretty
good. We'll see if it needs any changes when we look at the next Epic.

So now we're moving on to EPIC 2, which is all about setting up the Anthropic Claude SDK.
And it talks about, let's get it installed. Seems like a good first step.
After that, it's trying to implement one of the tools, which is the read JSON.
Then it's going to do the write JSON and the write file.
And then after all of that, we're going to integrate socket streaming.
And we're going to do it both for the server, but we're also going to have the chat messages working with this.
And then after that, we're going to implement the full event loop.
Now it's this particular EPIC that I'm having a few challenges with.
And I'll go over what they are soon and how I can change them pretty quickly.
But let's look at the third EPIC.

Now, the third epic is all about setting up a React application as the front end.
So when we look at 3.1, it's initializing React with Vite application, then 3.2 is setting
up ShadCN, configuring it with Tailwind CSS.
After that, we build the chat interface using the Versel AI elements.
And lastly, we're just giving it a simple light mode, dark mode.
Now, we've got all sorts of rationale being listed.
We could move on from there, but like I said, I think there's a problem in Epic 2.
And the main issues I can see is that after installing the SDK, it starts going into setting
up tools, but we haven't defined yet where they fit into the event loop.
We don't even know whether the event loop is going to work and communicate correctly
with the client.
And so as we work through all those stories, we're going to be fairly blind as to...
And so as we work through all the stories in Epic 2, we're going to be pretty blind
to whether they're working until the very end of the epic, where it all comes together
in a big avalanche.

So to resolve this problem I could have a conversation here but what I find
easier is to just start selecting the context we need. What I've done is copied
all the way up to when the epic first started. At this point I just select that
put in the clipboard. After that I just like to open a new conversation which
I've got down below and I've started it with the statement I want you to read
and absorb the following information and then wait for me for guidance. And that
complete epic list has been pasted in. So that new conversation knows what we've
got. We've got it highlighted in blue and I just tell it that you're going to help me
build up an instruction that we can put back into the previous conversation. So
the goal of this conversation is purely to build a prompt to paste into this
conversation. Now that it knows the goal for the conversation what I want to tell
it is I need a Q&A session with it to say what I think are the issues and I
want it to give me questions to get clarity around the problem. But before we
get started I ask it to do a bit of a Q&A session with me to get clarity
around the problems as I see it. So the first bit of the Q&A session is I tell
it that I'm pretty happy with epic one. I think it's good but I think there's
stuff that we're going to talk about in epic two that will impact it. So I just
prepare it to know that it can change epic one even though at the moment it's
pretty good. After that I went through epic two and each of the stories and I
just gave it this long diatribe. Now I was just dictating directly into the
microphone. It was writing out everything as we go and so the good thing about
this is it can make it more readable for me. So the first thing it does is start
to unpack the issues that I had addressed. And with that, so these are the
main things it unpacked. It figured out that stories 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4
can't be properly verified until we've done the event loop. It also worked out
that the event loop is not a single story. There's both a beginning and an
incremental development of it before it finishes. It identified from my
conversation that what was called story 2.4 was actually two different concepts.
One was the streaming client area, the other was the same streaming client but
specifically for the agent SDK. And this also led it to understanding that 1.4
might need some modifications. Now because I asked it to do a Q&A system it
actually came up with four pretty solid questions but one of the things I
noticed while reading them was it kind of suggested the answers as it went. So
it's a question of is it asking me questions or does it already have good
recommendations and I just need to sign them off. So I just told it that all of
the answers, all the questions seem okay. So I just told it that the questions
it's asking I already thought it had the answer could you just give me the
recommendation. It just saves me a lot more time than actually engaging in the
Q&A. And so it wrote these recommendations so the minimum viable
event loop after 2.1 becomes this idea of create a basic event loop and there's
no tooling, no streaming, there's just the fact that it can receive messages from
the SDK. At the moment at the end of EPIC 1 we're just doing HTTP requests but it
thinks that it might be useful to put in some socket functionality at that point.
It now feels that the event loop that we're building is a bunch of capabilities
that can be done as multiple stories mostly here in 2.4 to 2.6 and we can
move the tools that we want to do into 2.4 to 2.6 and when I look at that I
realize that even before we move on to EPIC 3 if I want to build in other
capabilities like Claude skills this EPIC will be the right way to go because
it's designed in such a way that each new, because it's designed in such a way
that each cross-cutting concern or aspect can be added one at a time later
on if needed. So it's already figured out a much better plan but remember that the
initial part of this conversation was can you create the instruction for me. So
I just tell it down the bottom here and I'll press enter that this is perfect. I
love the way it's thinking. What it needs to do is now create those
instructions that we want to put back into the top conversation and just so
you know that top conversation is this one that's here we're going to take
whatever comes out of this conversation and drop it straight into here to
modify it. So here's our detailed instruction set we can just go all the
way to the bottom with this we'll make a copy of it come up here and paste it in
203 lines of information just by asking a couple of questions. So it's already
started working on things one of the interesting things is it's also playing
around with the product requirements document right here. So the changes we
asked for have been implemented we've got a change to story 1.4 and we've got
a whole new re-ordering and breaking up of EPIC 2 and what the number of
stories really tell us is how many development sessions are going to go on
because we'll get the scrum master and the developer to work on each story's
sequential. We'll get the scrum master and the developer to work on each of the
stories sequentially starting from one and going through to number 14. So
quickly looking at the PRD we've got the new EPIC list it's the monorepo set up
the agents or the server in the back end and the front end client and then we've
got all the details coming through one story at a time. These are just simple
stories they'll be converted into full-blown stories with the scrum master
and we can see the main breakup that I needed which is to start off with an
event loop not finish with an event loop and then add streaming and logging as we
go and then after that we can do the tools and finally finish off and then
finally connect it all up to the react front end.
you

So with the very complete epic list in place we'll come back to our
conversation and just move on to the next step which is the checklist. So what
the checklist has done is just read the PRD. Now this is from a product owner or
product managers point of view so this is all the business cases have been
covered. We haven't yet gone to the tech stack or the software architects point
of view that's the next area but when we look at it it says it's 92%
complete there's some problems with it but it's mentioned that the user
research area isn't really that relevant for a demonstration like this so I won't
worry about it and so everything else has passed except for this area in the
MVP. So any blockers to moving forward well there's none identified are there
any high-level issues that we should be aware of. I think this is one we might
address but we'll do it using it asking a recommendation rather than actually
taking the time to define it because the AI will probably do a better job
than me at coming up with an answer anyway. These medium level issues don't
really matter to me like the target user doesn't matter and the success metrics
don't matter in this particular project. Now this low level one I will get it to
come up with a solution here I don't want to use an external framework I
don't need a logging system but I do want something consistent about the way
we do logging. Now my background has been software engineering software
architecture and even for a time a scrum master so these numbers that you're
seeing here the 23 days to get this application written are legitimate
numbers this is about how long it would take to do a project like this if you
were doing it in an enterprise system but at the end of the video I'll tell
you how long it's taken to do the documentation and to do the coding so
we'll see what numbers really come back. So I've just dictated a little statement
about the outer scope area like what does it suggest we put in there and I've
also said that for the logging I don't want to use a logging framework but I
wouldn't mind some simplistic patterns predefined before we get started and
this is perfect this is just what I didn't want to actually type in myself
so we're not going to use database and persistent authentication
authorization isn't needed it's not for production testing infrastructure is
not important in this process advanced features like quality gate hooks all
this sort of stuff was all out of scope for me it doesn't need to be a polished
UI though I hope it'll be pretty good with ShadCN and Tailwind CSS and
developer experience well that's something I wouldn't mind so we might
actually change that one area and the logging and monitoring is also really
good it's come up with just a simple JavaScript logo platform it's not trying
to use libraries or anything like that so we can go with all of that so I'm
just asking it to update the PRD with all the changes the only little change
I mentioned is that the hot module reloading which is a developer
experience I don't want that to not be in the system because that really helps
us develop quicker if when you change some code you automatically see it in
the browser this is a great capability to keep so changes like modifying a bit
of code and seeing it updated directly in the client is a really nice
capability to have in the application from the from the beginning so we can
see that our documents been updated our change log we've got a out of scope
section we've got logging patterns and we got advanced developer experience
details added so we're all complete with our PRD at this point it's suggesting
that we hand off to the architect we could do it in this conversation but
what we'll do is we'll just exit out of Claude and clear up and start a new
Claude session because we want to have a clean context to get up and running with
the architecture
