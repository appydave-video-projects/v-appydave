Now we're about to get into development but we should have a look at what our dots look like.
So we have the brief that was generated, we've split the PRD out into individual files,
we've done the same thing for the architecture, but I haven't gotten rid of those files.
I've moved them into an archive directory and I've left the planning document
because that's got a lot of detailed files that we can lean on if we need to
at the time of generating the stories.
