Now I've just implemented 2.3 which is real-time streaming and one of the
interesting things is I was also able to create a BMAD workflow to do all the
work for me in one sequential flow. We'll look at that in a moment but for now
let's just test it out.

So, I've created a bunch of testing prompts that we can work with.
The idea is that I want to see chunks come through the system, so we'll go and select
this particular one and come back to our web form.
Now, I've made a minor change to the system prompts that it has a command called test.
What I want it to do is ignore the idea that it's a web application building agent and
we'll just paste this information in and it's starting to write some information.
You can see here it's saying processing at the moment and all of this has been done in
one chunk.
So, the interesting thing about the Claude Agent SDK is that you can't stream word by
word.
It is done in chunks, so it's a little bit slow between updates, but you can see that
the chunking is working.
But you can see that the streaming is working between where my initial message came through
and then the agent got involved.

We'll try a different version where we're testing of reading the package.json we've
got I'll help you read the package.json so we see chunk 0 coming through
right here it will now do an analysis and now it'll do an analysis MD and then
we see it come through and we can see the three chunks coming through over in
the console.

So the last test is what would happen if we bombarded it with ideas so I'm going
to put in number 10 and we'll press enter then we'll paste and we'll put 20
and we'll paste and we'll put 100 and then we'll paste and we'll do 10 again
and we can see that counting to 10 this is what it's come up with count to 20
it's done that for us count to 20 and notice things are starting to get a
little bit out of order so it's basically as the information comes in
is when it's written to the stream and what I notice about this that is that it
works very much similar to how Claude code would work which is different to
chat GPT where you actually have to wait for each response to come through now I
don't personally know whether the way with Claude code if I was to rapid-fire
prompts like this they kind of get aggregated and you get really
interesting you you can put in an idea and then follow it up with a change of
idea and it takes it into account don't think that's happening here but we've
got the rudimentary ideas of what you can already do with Claude code or
working

Now let's get back to the workflow because I created a custom workflow to
build all this out so that it could just run without too much input from me and
it's called the AppyDave workflow what it does is it starts off by asking a
question what story do you want to have so we did 2.3 at that point it started
creating the story and it did that by starting up the Scrum Master and running
the draft story command and as per normal we got a detailed story written
it's in draft format at the moment and it's as a developer I want to stream
responses so that the end users can see information progressively now we've seen
that working so we know it's all going on it wrote the initial plan of what the
code should look like in the story and then and then it give and then it gave
me this status update so we can see that it's in draft or the acceptance
criteria is there and it's got a couple of questions do I want to continue do I
want to skip or exit so I just so we got this final status of what's going on
what is the status of the doc so we got this final update of so we got a final
summary of the creation of the story we can see that it's in draft mode at the
moment and it's asked me do I want to continue on to validation or skip now I
said that the validation is optional but I decided to just press continue and we
can see it's now going into and we can see that it's now going to the product
owner and validating the information in the story against other documents

I don't think when you've finished off working through the
Happy Dave workflow that you did the QA bot.

Is there something wrong in the workflow instructions that's not highlighting this?
Is there something wrong in the workflow instructions?
Yes.
Okay.

Okay.
No, no, that is right.
A review story does not create a markdown document.
The workflow is meant to load in the QA bot and then run the review story command.
What about our workflow is not doing that?
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Are you keeping our workflow document up to date or giving it extra information to remind
it not to screw up?
