So, I've created a bunch of testing prompts that we can work with.
The idea is that I want to see chunks come through the system, so we'll go and select
this particular one and come back to our web form.
Now, I've made a minor change to the system prompts that it has a command called test.
What I want it to do is ignore the idea that it's a web application building agent and
we'll just paste this information in and it's starting to write some information.
You can see here it's saying processing at the moment and all of this has been done in
one chunk.
So, the interesting thing about the Claude Agent SDK is that you can't stream word by
word.
It is done in chunks, so it's a little bit slow between updates, but you can see that
the chunking is working.
But you can see that the streaming is working between where my initial message came through
and then the agent got involved.
