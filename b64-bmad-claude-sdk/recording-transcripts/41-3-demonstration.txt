So let's bring up our page and we'll click on the home, see what we get and we've got a shop now and a chat with us and it looks like we've got some featured products on the beginning.
Let's go back to shop now and we're taken back to the products.
At this point it might be useful to create some blog posts so we'll start with a little bit of data right now.
And we can see that it's creating it with a title, author, date, content and tags so it's very much related to the book.
So it's very much related to the bookstore. If we click on the blog post we can see the information coming through here and here.
So we'll create a HTML page, we're making sure we're using the sockets. If we bring up the page, it's started writing the page.
Now I think it's created the blog page but when we look there's no link on the products, there's no link on the home page.
So what we'll do is we'll just jump down and put in, can you add a link to the blog and the home page?
Can you add a link on the home and the products page? If we click through, we can read our blog articles here, this looks good.
We'll click on home, we'll come back to the products and we've got the blog here as well.
