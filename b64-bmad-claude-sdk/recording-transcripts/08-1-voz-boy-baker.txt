So let me give you a glimpse of what the application we're currently building
can be used for and it's this storyline application that generated this movie
we've got character consistency scene consistency and everything was
generated using Claude code in the background to generate the data
structures so as we start asking questions like can you create three
products that will generate complex JSON documents behind the scene well that's
what's happened with the storyline application but instead there's a simple
narrative that converts into image and style guides
