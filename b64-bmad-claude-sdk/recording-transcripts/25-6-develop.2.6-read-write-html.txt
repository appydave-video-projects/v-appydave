So we'll go with the idea of can it delete widgets from the test products
table, the JSON document. Can we also go to the AITLDR CSS and we'll start
changing the colors to be a light pink, blue and yellow. We'll send that through
to the agent. We should see it coming down the bottom here. So currently it's
doing a search broadly for the CSS files. It's found them. It's now going to read
the full content from them. It's found widget A, B and C which it's going to
remove from the JSON. Then it's going to go and update the CSS and it looks like
it's done that. And what we'll do is click on AITLDR and look at that we've got
Brut, we've got pinks, blues and yellows and we've removed the three widgets.
