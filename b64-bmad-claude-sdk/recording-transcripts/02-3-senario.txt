engineering and the framework we're going to use is the BMAD method to build this application
in front of us.
But the technical reality of this is that we're going to use context engineering via
the BMAD method to build the application, it'll build all the data.
But the technical reality of this is that we're going to use context engineering using
the BMAD method and tools like the Agent SDK to make this application a reality.
