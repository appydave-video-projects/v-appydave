So it's finished the alignment with the architecture document. It's listed a bunch of areas
I've read through them all and they're very minor
So I think the main thing that we can do is just apply number one
Which is the recommendations to the PRD can be applied right now
So those minor alignment issues are now being fixed between the PRD and the architecture
What we're going to do now is change over to the PO
The product donor and this is because we want to shard the documents now
If I just jump down to this view here
Sharding is the idea of splitting up a big document into little documents and a few of the agents can do sharding
But the one that's designed to do for both architecture and PRDs is the PO and that's why we've jumped over to there
And we can see the command here
It's called shard doc followed by the document we want to work with and the destination that we want to put it in
So we'll start by typing in shard doc and I'll put in the at sign and type in the PRD
And after that we'll put it into a file that doesn't currently exist
Which is why I haven't used the at sign its docs PRD
Now while that's doing that we'll head over to VS code to see what's going on
So it's this big document that we've got going on here and we're moving it into this folder and you can see
everything being split up and
There should be a little index that points to where all the different parts of that file exist
So with that done we go back and we run the shard doc again this time. We're going to click on architecture and
If we head over we should get an architecture folder being generated and we've got all the
indexes pointing to each individual file as well
