So now we're ready to start developing our application so to get started we
need the scrub master and the scrub master will read through the epic and
create the first story for us and that can be done by using this command here
called draft so what we'll do is we'll type in draft and we could say
something like draft first story in this case so I've got draft first story from
first epic and if we go over and have a look at the epics list our first one is
the mono repo the first one is the mono repo set up with the basic server and
client so we can see it starting to gather architecture context here we've
got all the different documents that we've created in the architecture folder
being read as needed it's ensuring for the first time that we've made the
stories directory now I've already done that manually now keep in mind that from
the epic point of view it's only got this basic information to start with so
it's drawing from that followed by all the architecture documents and we now
have our first and we now have our first story in draft mode so at this point we
can read it and see that it basically starts off with the story card and the
acceptance criteria that it got from the epic and we can see that it's grabbed
from the epic the story card and the acceptance criteria and from that it's
just developed a bunch of tasks and sub tasks to work with it's aware that
there's no story to start off with this is the first one it accesses the tech
stack we've got the project structure that it's meant to be creating we
understand the workspace that we're in and it's gone and prepared some shared
types so it's grabbing a lot of this information from the architecture
document setting up the naming conventions the coding conventions
setting up the naming conventions and the coding standards and it also
understands how to set up the type script configuration it's filled in an
area for testing which at the moment we don't have any testing and so at this
point we could start doing development now the normal flow in an application
would be to read through this and check everything is okay for now I'm just
going to change this from draft to ready and hit save and then we can go back to
Claude where we can start doing our development now it needed to be in that
ready mode so we've done that so we'll just switch over to the development
agent and we can just type develop story now I'm going to put in the 1.1
because it'll make it easier for it to find the correct document without having
to look through documents and now it has a plan of action of what it's going to
work through so it's going to set up our package.json create the workspace
directory structure for us move on to configuring type script create the
workspace package.json and create the shared types we'll do the gitignore and
then finally it will verify that the mono repo has been set up correctly so
at the end of this we should have a lot of new code in the system not
necessarily sure if there's anything that we're going to see visually if we
try to run it so it's finished developing all the code it makes a
statement that everything is in place it's a little bit hard to test because
we don't actually have any source code just yet but when we look at the story
the story has been updated we have a lot of check boxes of the work that's been
done when I personally run the build I got a couple of errors but they're
actually listed here so that's okay all the files have actually been created so
at that point we can close off this story
