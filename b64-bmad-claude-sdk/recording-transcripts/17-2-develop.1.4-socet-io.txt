so we can see the endpoints that we want to test but if we go and look at the
SAT plan we've got a little bit of console logging that we should see in
chat and we should see some server responses if we type anything into the
chat window apparently it can also handle a disconnection so let's go test
them out so here's our web application we'll hit refresh and it's saying that
we're currently connected let's just say let's just say Appy Dave here press
enter and we're getting a response received I've just asked it to kill the
server over in Claude code because I think it's running in the background
over here I didn't actually start it and look at that it's starting to say that
it's disconnected what I'll do is restart it from the terminal myself and
if we come back to our web application hopefully it just automatically
reconnects
