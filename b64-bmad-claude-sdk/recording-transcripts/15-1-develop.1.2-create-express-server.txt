So with our first story down we'll do a commit and we can see that there's all
the new configuration and setup for the mono repo plus there's all the
architecture PRD and the initial story has been added as well. Now we're ready
to go on to 1.2 but what we'll do is make sure we exit Claude code and we'll
start up again with a fresh context at that point we can just start saying draft
story 1.2. We'll set up a new Claude code and the first thing we need to do is
make sure we're on the scrum master and we'll type in draft story 1.2 and let it
go and build that new document for us. Now like before we've got now like
before it goes through a template loads in information from the epic that we're
on story 1.2 loads in all the technical architecture documents also reads from
the previous story so it knows what's already been done. So story 1.2 has been
drafted everything's in place what we can do is go over to Visual Studio and
click on the story here. I just had a quick look through the document so I've
set the status to ready but we've got our acceptance criteria we've got all
of our subtasks in place. So now it's time to develop we just go back I've
already set up the development agent and we'll just type in develop story 1.2 and
let it run. Now while it's doing that now while that's running I'll just talk
about the idea of working with multiple projects at once. One of the things I
love about BeMAD is that if you are generating two different applications
you've got a fair bit of time while the development is going on. So you saw what
I did I set up the story then I switched over to the developer agent and I kicked
it off. At that point I'll often just shift tab over. At that point I'll go to
another terminal where I've already got BeMAD running on a different project
and goes through the same process. Now personally I can't do three projects at
a time because usually the first project has finished and I've got to go back and
manually renew it and I've got to go back and manually review it but the good
thing is that you can be working on two different applications at the same time.
So we'll just come back and have a look at what it's doing and we can see that
as it goes it's signing off on tasks that it's done and it just keeps working
through them. So it's finished the development the definition of done has
been filled in. We've got some new files what we'll do is we'll jump over to the
quality assurance agent. So again we're going through a number of code quality
metrics and we'll just jump over to VS code and we can see a list of the
changes that wherever it says this story and we can go and have a look at the
code over here. Now if you're a developer this is an area that you probably spend
a lot of time looking. I work more as a software architect and so while it would
be smart for me to check all the code I usually don't check the code and that's
an interesting thing about this. I've built complete enterprise applications
and I spend more time working on the documentation to check the code quality
than I do in actually looking at the code. Now the agents I use for that I'll
talk about in future videos at the moment we're just trying to build a
simple application. So all the completion notes have been filled in we know the
files that have been checked with we know the files that have been changed
with we know the files that have been changed and now the QA has come in so if
we go and open up QA and look at the quality gate number 1.2 we can see a
YAML file on the changes though it's a lot easier to see it back in the Claude
context window.
