so it's read in the brief I've read it everything seems okay to me so I'm just
going to press 1 and continue on that notice as it goes it creates a change
log so we've got version 1 which is the initial PRD created from the project
brief and now we get into the hearts of what a product requirements document is
we're coming up with the functional requirements as we go so FR1 would be
the first functional requirement so it's listing all the basic capabilities
that this application is going to do and then after that it does the non
functional requirements which is all abstractions or ideas that the system's
going to work on such as the line limit on the server the fact that we're going
to use Claude auth to log into the system now like with the interactive mode
with product brief we could just move on to the next section but it's got a
couple of areas needing validation is 200 lines realistic and should we have
pre-built examples so I'm just going to make a simple adjustment here it says
the 200 is a suggestion what I'm trying to do is have the actual event loop of
the agent be fairly small and contained there's not a lot that you need to do
there but this is a guideline it's not a limit at all what I wanted to ensure
that it does is not create complex structures as it builds out this system
because there's nothing complex about the Claude code event loop the other
thing I wanted to do is not general the other thing I wanted to talk about is
this area or should we have a pre-built example application no we shouldn't this
is all vibe coding that we're going to ask people to do but we may actually
create some examples later on so we'll just press the enter on that and so the
functional requirements have been updated we've removed a concept and
we've done slight updates and so this is a lot more important than in the brief
to get this right so we'll move on to the next step but the idea is that this
is what's actually going to get built
