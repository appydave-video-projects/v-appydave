Now we have our chat application created using the BMAD method. It's got the
Claude SDK as a backend. Some of the capabilities is that at the moment we're
seeing no pages but as we add pages they'll appear automatically. There's
also an activity log showing every file that's coming through. There's also an
activity log showing every file coming through. So if we just start off with our
first creation we're going to create five bookstore products. We've set the
price as one of them is out of stock and it's created a file and automatically
updated the products. Now it's created a file and automatically created products.
We can see five products created here. Next we'll create a
products HTML file. Now as that comes through it should automatically update
this to show one product at which point we'll be able to click on it and see a
menu.
