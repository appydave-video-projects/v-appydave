Now we're nearly at the end and about to demonstrate this system all working so
the 3.4 planning document ended up getting a fair few changes. This became
a little bit of a conversation to deal with different issues so the first thing
we did was we added in the light mode dark mode and that's working. We've got
an activity slide out panel that's actually working really well. Clicks
happen everywhere it's all using socket IO. It had nice status checks on when
files are added, deleted, updated. When I went to use the system there were a
number of issues just with the system prompt so I kept feeding the
conversationist back in and asking it to update the system prompt. It now works
really well and so now I've set it up for four different demonstrations. Now
there's only two in the video. The first one is the four prompts that are going
on here. The first one is a little video. The first one is the little example at
the beginning of the video is essentially based off these prompts here
and the full session that we're about to demonstrate is the creation of the
bookstore. It's the creation of the bookstore and we can see all the prompts
that we're about to run. So with that so let's see this whole system in action.
