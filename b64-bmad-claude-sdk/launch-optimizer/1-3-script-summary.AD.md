# Script Summary - AppyDave Video Notes

## Key Talking Points (when showing the wall of text)

### 1. Summary vs Abridgment
"Summary is lossy compression - like a thumbnail. It's for tweets, social posts, quick hits. Abridgment is near-lossless - like JPEG. It's your source of truth for educational content."

### 2. Fit for Purpose
"The summary missed narrative elements - the why, the journey, the ending. But that's fine. It's not supposed to capture everything. It's supposed to give you enough for a tweet."

### 3. Downstream Determines Design
"What's the output going to be used for? That determines how much information you need to preserve. Tweets need highlights. Articles need everything."

## Image Prompts for Jan

### Image 1: Compression Levels

**Diagram Title**: LOSSY VS LOSSLESS COMPRESSION

**Content to Draw**:
- Left: Large document labeled "TRANSCRIPT" with many lines
- Middle top path: Small box labeled "SUMMARY" → "TWEETS" (with compression artifacts/missing pieces visual)
- Middle bottom path: Medium box labeled "ABRIDGMENT" → "ARTICLES, DOCS" (clean, complete)
- Action bursts: "LOSSY!" "LOSSLESS!"

**Bottom Caption**: Different outputs need different compression levels.

### Image 2: Downstream Flow

**Diagram Title**: SUMMARY FEEDS SHORT-FORM

**Content to Draw**:
- Top: Document icon "SUMMARY"
- Arrows pointing to 3 outputs: Twitter bird icon "TWEET", Facebook icon "POST", LinkedIn icon "UPDATE"
- Each output is small/compact
- Action burst: "QUICK!"

**Bottom Caption**: Summary → Social. Short and punchy.
