# Title Shortlist Selection - AppyDave Video Notes

## Key Talking Points (when showing the wall of text)

### 1. The Knowledge Gap
"The AI generated ten title ideas, but none combined BMAD with Claude Agent SDK. Why? Because it doesn't know my brand requirements - that's domain knowledge I haven't shared."

### 2. Optional Custom Instructions
"This reveals a pattern: 'Optional Custom Instructions.' What if I could tell the AI 'titles must include BMAD and Agent SDK'? Feed it constraints before it generates, not corrections after."

### 3. Starter Titles, Not Final Titles
"These shortlisted titles aren't the final answer - they're conversation starters. Section 5 does proper title generation with more context. This step just narrows the field."
