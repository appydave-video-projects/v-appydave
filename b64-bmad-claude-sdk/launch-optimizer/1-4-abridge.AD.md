# Abridge Step - AppyDave Video Notes

## Key Talking Points (when showing the wall of text)

### 1. The JPEG Analogy
"Think of abridgment like JPEG compression. The file is smaller, but you can't tell the difference visually. All the meaningful information is still there - just without the fluff."

### 2. MUST vs MAY
"The V2 prompt splits everything into MUST preserve and MAY remove. Named entities, story numbers, problems and solutions - those MUST stay. Filler words, repeated explanations - those MAY go."

### 3. Research Before Design
"Here's the real insight: I improved this prompt by asking an LLM to make it better. That works. But smarter prompt engineers research first. Claude Code has a compression algorithm. Academic NLP has decades of work on this. Study the prior art before you design."

## Image Prompts for Jan

### Image 1: MUST vs MAY Rules

**Diagram Title**: NEAR-LOSSLESS COMPRESSION RULES

**Content to Draw**:
- Two columns side by side
- Left column (green): "MUST PRESERVE" with icons for: person (Named Entities), numbers (Story Numbers), bug (Problems & Solutions), tools (Commands)
- Right column (red): "MAY REMOVE" with icons for: speech bubble with "um" (Filler), repeat arrows (Repeated), transition arrow (Transitions)
- Action bursts: "KEEP!" "CUT!"

**Bottom Caption**: Preserve what matters. Remove what doesn't.

### Image 2: Research Before Design

**Diagram Title**: PROMPT ENGINEERING THE SMART WAY

**Content to Draw**:
- Left path (crossed out): Person → LLM → "Improved Prompt" (labeled "ITERATE ONLY")
- Right path (highlighted): Person → Research icon (web, docs, papers) → LLM → "Better Prompt" (labeled "RESEARCH FIRST")
- Examples below research: "Claude Code compression", "Academic NLP", "Published techniques"
- Action burst: "STUDY!"

**Bottom Caption**: Don't just iterate. Research how others solved the problem first.

### Image 3: Source of Truth

**Diagram Title**: ABRIDGMENT FEEDS EVERYTHING

**Content to Draw**:
- Top: Large document "TRANSCRIPT"
- Middle: Medium document "ABRIDGMENT" (highlighted as key node)
- Bottom: Multiple outputs branching from abridgment: "SKOOL DOC", "LINKEDIN", "BLOG", "DESCRIPTION", "CHAPTERS"
- Arrow showing information flows down without loss
- Action burst: "SOURCE!"

**Bottom Caption**: If the abridgment loses info, every downstream output loses it too.
