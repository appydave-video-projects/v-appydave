# Configure Step - AppyDave Video Notes

## Key Talking Points (when showing the wall of text)

### 1. Draft vs Final Outputs
"Not every output is meant to be final. Title ideas at this stage are 'starter titles' - rough suggestions to frame the discussion. The real title generation happens later with more context."

### 2. Context Drives Quality
"Why do title ideas struggle here? Because we only have raw transcript. Better titles need summaries, keywords, and content highlights - downstream context that doesn't exist yet."

### 3. Flexible Selection Pattern
"This is a 'Flexible Selection' checkpoint - the AI gives you numbered options as inspiration, but you're free to pick, modify, or create your own. It's a collaboration, not a multiple choice test."
