# INTRO ANALYSIS (5 items)

## Item 1: Hook

**Extract:**
> "Imagine building a self-editing application. What that means is that you could talk to it and it generates all the data in the back end or you could ask it to visualize it and html pages suddenly materialized."

**Analysis Values:**
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| hookType | imagination |
| emotionalTrigger | curiosity |
| strength | strong |

**My Opinion:**
This is a textbook "imagination hook" - opens with "Imagine" and paints a vivid picture. The concept is novel enough to create genuine curiosity. Strong because it's specific (talk to it, generates data, HTML materializes) rather than vague promises.

**Q1:** Do you agree this is a "strong" imagination hook? Or would you rate it differently?

## Item 2: Promise

**Extract:**
> "In this video we're going to use the Agent SDK from Claude Code to do that and we're going to build this application using the BMAD method."

**Analysis Values:**
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| clarity | clear |
| specificity | specific |
| deliverable | Build a self-editing application using Agent SDK and BMAD method |

**My Opinion:**
Clear and specific - names exact tools and outcome. Viewer knows what they're getting. No ambiguity.

**Q2:** Is this level of specificity typical for your videos, or do you sometimes leave the promise more open?

---

## Item 3: Sign-off

**Extract:**
> "I'm AppyDave, let's get into it."

**Analysis Values:**
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| brandConsistency | true |
| transitionClarity | clear |

**My Opinion:**
Consistent brand catchphrase. Clear signal that intro is ending. Short and effective.

**Q3:** Is "let's get into it" your standard phrase, or do you vary it?

---

## Item 4: Chapter Mention

**Extract:**
> "Now this video is a step-by-step tutorial so if you want to move ahead or go backwards and forwards check out the chapter links in the description."

**Analysis Values:**
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| placement | appropriate |

**My Opinion:**
Good for a 2-hour video. Sets expectations (step-by-step tutorial) and gives navigation. Placed after sign-off but before content starts.

**Q4:** Do you always include chapter mentions for long videos? What's your threshold (30 min? 1 hour?)?

---

## Item 5: Demo Preview

**Extract:**
> "So our Agent SDK application is built and this is what it can do for us. So we're going into the chat bot where we're going to enter in some products we should be able to view those products and see that they're being stored in the back end..."

**Analysis Values:**
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| showsDontTell | true |
| intrigueLevel | high |

**My Opinion:**
Shows the finished product before explaining how to build it. Creates "I want that" desire. Lists multiple capabilities. This is the same content that should also appear in breakouts.

**Q5:** This demo preview is in the intro extract but NOT in the breakout extract. Should the breakout prompt have caught this too? Is it a gap in the breakout prompt, or is intro the right (only) place for it?

---

# OUTRO ANALYSIS (3 items)

## Item 6: Recap

**Extract:**
> "So that brings us to the end and what we've been able to do is build this complete application just with natural language prompts and we did that using context engineering that's with the BMAD method..."

**Analysis Values:**
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| completeness | comprehensive |
| reinforcesPromise | true |
| keyTakeaway | Built complete application with natural language prompts using context engineering (BMAD) and Claude Agent SDK |

**My Opinion:**
Comprehensive recap that directly fulfills the intro promise. Lists specific deliverables. Good closure.

**Q6:** Do you consciously try to callback to the intro promise in your outros, or does it happen naturally?

---

## Item 7: Teaser

**Extract:**
> "Now if you're loving the power of BMAD in the next video we're going to use BMAD again but this time we're going to recreate an orchestration framework just like BMAD we're going to call it POEM..."

**Analysis Values:**
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| curiosityLevel | high |
| connectionToCurrent | Direct continuation - uses BMAD again but for a new purpose |
| nextVideoTopic | POEM - Prompt Orchestration and Engineering Method |

**My Opinion:**
Strong teaser. "If you're loving" qualifies interested viewers. POEM acronym creates intrigue. Leverages satisfaction from current video.

**Q7:** Do you always have the next video planned when recording, or do you sometimes record teasers separately?

---

## Item 8: Sign-off (Outro)

**Extract:**
> "I'm AppyDave I'll see you in the next video"

**Analysis Values:**
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| brandConsistency | true |
| memorability | standard |

**My Opinion:**
Matches intro pattern. "See you in the next video" is common but effective.

**Q8:** No question - this is standard and works.

---

# CTA ANALYSIS (5 items)

## Item 9: Chapter Links CTA

**Extract:**
> "Check out the chapter links in the description"

**Analysis Values:**
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| position | intro |
| ctaType | description |
| directness | soft |

**My Opinion:**
This is a navigation CTA, not promotional. Helps the viewer. I classified it as CTA but it's borderline - could argue it's just intro content.

**Q9:** Should "check out chapter links" be classified as a CTA, or is it really just navigation guidance that doesn't belong in the CTA extract?

---

## Item 10: Skool Community CTA

**Extract:**
> "You might want to check the link in the description where you can go to my Skool community where I'll be talking about this on a daily basis"

**Analysis Values:**
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| position | early |
| ctaType | community |
| directness | soft |

**My Opinion:**
Non-pushy phrasing ("might want to"). Offers ongoing value. Well-placed after establishing credibility.

**Q10:** Is Skool your primary community CTA? Do you mention it in every video?

---

## Item 11: VOZ Video CTA

**Extract:**
> "If you want to see a five minute video around the Boy and the Baker by VOZ then check out the link in the description"

**Analysis Values:**
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| position | middle |
| ctaType | video |
| directness | soft |

**My Opinion:**
Cross-promotion to client work. Contextually relevant. Conditional phrasing respects viewer choice.

**Q11:** How often do you cross-promote client work in your AppyDave videos?

---

## Item 12: GitHub Repo CTA (Middle)

**Extract:**
> "Available up on the GitHub repo if you want to access that there's a link to my community down below"

**Analysis Values:**
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| position | middle |
| ctaType | repository |
| directness | soft |

**My Opinion:**
High value for technical audience. Non-pushy. Placed after showing relevant code.

**Q12:** No question - this is appropriate for a coding tutorial.

---

## Item 13: Repo + Community CTA (Outro)

**Extract:**
> "Now all the code is available you can check it out in the repository and if you want to join the community we have more of a discussion and teachings each day on prompt engineering"

**Analysis Values:**
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| position | outro |
| ctaType | repository |
| directness | direct |

**My Opinion:**
More direct than mid-video mentions. Combined repo + community. Standard outro CTA placement.

**Q13:** This CTA also appears in the outro extract (as part of recap). Is that duplication a problem, or is it fine to have it in both places?

---

# BREAKOUT ANALYSIS (3 items)

## Item 14: New Conversation Technique

**Extract:**
> "I just like to open a new conversation which I've got down below. The new conversation knows what we've got I've got it highlighted in blue and I just tell it that you're going to help me build up an instruction that we can put back into the previous conversation..."

**Analysis Values:**
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| breakoutType | problem-solving |
| standaloneValue | medium |
| potentialFormats | short, snippet |
| keyLesson | Use a separate conversation to build complex instructions, then paste back into your main context |

**My Opinion:**
Teaches a transferable technique but needs context of why the problem occurred. Medium standalone value - could be a short but would need setup.

**Q14:** Is this "second conversation" technique something you use frequently? Could it be a standalone video?

---

## Item 15: Second Brain for Agent Creation

**Extract:**
> "I've gone and set myself up a new window this is a conversation I have with a second brain and the second brain has knowledge about things like BMAD version 4 and version 6 and I've had it just construct for me instructions for creating a story acceptance testing agent"

**Analysis Values:**
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| breakoutType | creation |
| standaloneValue | high |
| potentialFormats | video, short, blog |
| keyLesson | Maintain a second brain with documentation knowledge to help you create custom agents on-the-fly |

**My Opinion:**
High standalone value. Complete concept - using a second brain to create custom agents. Could absolutely be its own tutorial video.

**Q15:** Have you considered making a dedicated "second brain" video? This seems like a high-value standalone topic.

---

## Item 16: Postmortem as Training Data

**Extract:**
> "Now the reason I actually wrote this document wasn't just so that I could show you the sort of challenges that you can run into but because once you write a document like this you can make it a part of your documentation system so if any other issues happen in the future and you notice it you can say can you go and read other documentation or lessons learnt that were done in the past and this can be a perfect way of training the AI model to write code the right way"

**Analysis Values:**
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| breakoutType | retrospective |
| standaloneValue | high |
| potentialFormats | video, short, blog, tweet |
| keyLesson | Write postmortems not just for yourself but as training data for AI - it learns from your documented lessons |

**My Opinion:**
Meta-learning gold. Applicable to any AI-assisted development. High tweet/short potential - the insight is compact and powerful.

**Q16:** This insight about "postmortems as AI training data" - is this a pattern you've talked about before, or is it emerging from this work?

# META QUESTIONS (Patterns for Paige)

**Q17:** The demo preview appears in intro but NOT in breakouts. The breakout prompt is supposed to catch demos. Should we:
- A) Add demo detection to the breakout prompt
- B) Leave demo in intro only (it's part of intro structure, not a mid-video breakout)
- C) Accept duplication - capture it in both places

**Q18:** All CTA directness values came out as "soft" except the outro which is "direct". Is this your intentional style, or did the analysis get it wrong?

**Q19:** The `ctasPresent: true` flag in outro - should we remove it from the 10-2-extract-outro.hbs prompt since it's redundant with videoCtaExtract?

**Q20:** What learnings from this session should go into the Paige tips document?
