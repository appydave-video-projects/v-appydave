# Identify Chapters - AppyDave Video Notes

## Key Talking Points (when showing the wall of text)

### 1. Instructions That Sabotage Goals
"The prompt said 'minimize detail' - and the LLM obeyed. It gave me clean, general chapter names. But I needed story numbers. The instruction itself was the problem. Always check if your prompt instructions conflict with your actual goals."

### 2. Context Beyond the Transcript
"The AI doesn't know my file names. But my file names encode my intent - 'Story-2-File-Discovery', 'Story-3-Tools'. That's why Step 2-2 exists: it aligns AI suggestions with my folder structure. The author's artifacts matter."

### 3. Pipeline Thinking
"This prompt isn't meant to be perfect. It's a rough draft for the next step. Knowing that changes how I evaluate it. High recall, rough precision - that's fine for a first pass."

## Image Prompts for Jan

### Image 1: Conflicting Instructions

**Diagram Title**: INSTRUCTIONS THAT SABOTAGE GOALS

**Content to Draw**:
- Left: Prompt box with "MINIMIZE DETAIL" instruction
- Middle: LLM processing
- Right: Output missing "Story 1", "Story 2", "Story 3" labels
- Below: Sad creator saying "Where are my story numbers?"
- Action burst: "CHECK YOUR INSTRUCTIONS!"

**Bottom Caption**: The LLM followed instructions perfectly. The instructions were wrong.

### Image 2: Author's Hidden Context

**Diagram Title**: CONTEXT THE AI CAN'T SEE

**Content to Draw**:
- Top: Transcript document (what AI sees)
- Bottom: File folder icons with names like "Story-1-Setup", "Story-2-Discovery", "Story-3-Tools" (what AI doesn't see)
- Arrow showing information gap between them
- Action burst: "GIVE IT CONTEXT!"

**Bottom Caption**: File names, folders, timestamps - author artifacts encode intent.

### Image 3: Pipeline Position Matters

**Diagram Title**: EVALUATE IN CONTEXT

**Content to Draw**:
- Three boxes in sequence: "2-1 IDENTIFY" → "2-2 REFINE" → "2-3 CREATE"
- First box labeled "ROUGH DRAFT" (recall matters)
- Last box labeled "FINAL OUTPUT" (precision matters)
- Arrow showing refinement through pipeline
- Action burst: "PIPELINE!"

**Bottom Caption**: A rough first pass is fine when refinement comes next.
