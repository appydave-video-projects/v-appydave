  "transcriptAbridgement_v1": "This tutorial demonstrates building a self-editing application using the Claude Agent SDK and BMAD Method v4. The application enables users to generate data and HTML pages through natural language conversation.\n\nThe video begins by explaining that a self-editing application allows users to talk to it, generating backend data and visualizing HTML pages dynamically. The project uses context engineering with the BMAD method and vibe coding techniques.\n\nThe presenter installs BMAD Method v4 (choosing it over the alpha v6 which wasn't ready) using npx, selecting Agile Core framework and Claude Code as the agent system. The workflow follows BMAD's structured approach: Brief → PRD → Architecture → Stories → Development.\n\nUsing the Analyst agent (Mary), a project brief is created from existing planning documents. The brief defines a simple ~200-line Express server with Claude Agent SDK, React frontend with Socket.IO for real-time communication, and JSON file storage instead of a database. The application targets developers learning AI agent integration.\n\nThe PM agent (John) creates the PRD with functional requirements, identifying three epics: mono repo setup, Claude Agent SDK integration, and React frontend. After initial epic planning, a separate conversation refines Epic 2's sequencing to avoid building tools before the event loop is verified.\n\nThe Architect agent generates a comprehensive architecture document covering tech stack (Express, React 19, TypeScript, Vite, ShadCN, Tailwind), data models, API specifications, and component diagrams. The PO agent then shards both PRD and architecture into separate files.\n\nDevelopment proceeds story by story using the Scrum Master (Bob) to draft stories and Developer agent (James) to implement. A custom SAT (Story Acceptance Test) agent named Taylor is created to generate human-testable verification steps for each story.\n\nEpic 1 establishes the mono repo with client/server communication via Socket.IO. Epic 2 implements the Claude Agent SDK with tools for reading/writing JSON files and HTML. Story 2.4 adds list and preview capabilities after discovering the AI couldn't find available files. Story 2.7 adds conversational memory after a bug revealed the system wasn't retaining context between messages.\n\nEpic 3 builds the React frontend with ShadCN and Tailwind CSS. Story 3.3 encounters significant issues: Tailwind v3/v4 syntax conflicts, port conflicts with Claude spawning servers on different ports, and styling bugs. A postmortem documents lessons learned.\n\nThe final demonstration shows creating a bookstore application: adding products, generating HTML pages with CSS styling, creating blog posts, adding Christmas theming with snowfall animations, and dynamically linking pages together - all through conversation.\n\nThe video concludes by teasing the next project: POEM (Prompt Orchestration and Engineering Method), a framework for creating and testing prompts similar to BMAD.",
  "transcriptAbridgement_v2": "# BMAD Claude SDK Self-Editing Application Tutorial - Abridgement\n\n## Introduction & Concept\n\n**AppyDave** introduces building a **self-editing application** - an app where you talk to it, it generates backend data, and HTML pages materialize. Built using **Claude Agent SDK** and **BMAD Method v4**. The video is a step-by-step tutorial with chapter links.\n\nThe application demonstrates: creating products, building product listings, adding home pages, featuring products, and a complex multi-page workflow. The magic is the human experience of talking to generate features using **vibe coding** techniques, with the technical reality being **context engineering** using BMAD.\n\n## BMAD Installation (v4 vs v6)\n\nCommand: `npx bmad-method install`\n\nChose **v4** over **v6 alpha 9** because v6 wasn't ready (issues communicated to Brian from BMAD). Selected:\n- **Agile Core** framework\n- **Claude Code** as agent system\n- Sharding enabled for PRD and architecture docs\n\nBMAD installed to `.bmad-core/` with agents, workflows, templates, checklists, and user guide.\n\n## Phase 1: Project Brief (Analyst Agent - Mary)\n\nLoaded analyst via `/analyst` slash command. Created brief from existing planning document using `create project brief` command in interactive mode.\n\nOutput: `docs/brief.md`\n\nKey decisions documented:\n- **No database** - JSON documents stored in data directory, committed to git\n- **Target users**: Developers learning AI agent integration, technical educators, rapid prototypers, BMAD practitioners\n- **~200 lines of code** constraint for server (guideline, not limit - avoiding complexity)\n- **No authentication/authorization** needed\n- **Claude Max account** authentication (no API costs)\n- **Three epics defined** in MVP section (unusual placement but intentional)\n\n## Phase 2: PRD (PM Agent - John)\n\nLoaded PM via `/pm` slash command. Ran `*create-prd` command, loading brief as context.\n\n**Functional Requirements** (FR1+): Listed basic capabilities\n**Non-Functional Requirements**: Line limit on server, Claude auth\n\n**User Interface simplified** to:\n- Chat interface (primary screen)\n- No status panel, quality gates (removed complexity)\n\n**Epic List** (initial):\n1. Mono repo setup with basic client/server\n2. Claude Agent SDK integration\n3. React frontend with chat interface\n\n### Epic 2 Refinement (Separate Conversation)\n\nIdentified problem: Stories 2.2-2.4 (tools) couldn't be verified until event loop was done in 2.6.\n\nUsed second conversation to build detailed instructions, then pasted 203 lines back into main conversation.\n\n**Revised Epic 2 sequencing**:\n- 2.1: Install SDK\n- 2.2: Minimal event loop (no tools, no streaming)\n- 2.3: Socket functionality\n- 2.4-2.6: Tools (read JSON, write JSON, write HTML)\n- Each cross-cutting concern added one at a time\n\n**Story count**: 14 stories total, 3-4 per epic.\n\n**Out of scope documented**: Database, authentication, testing infrastructure, polished UI, advanced features.\n\n## Phase 3: Architecture (Architect Agent)\n\nLoaded architect, ran full-stack architecture command.\n\nOutput: `docs/architecture/` (2,500 line document, then sharded)\n\n**Tech Stack**:\n- Backend: Express.js, TypeScript, Node\n- Frontend: React 19, Vite, ShadCN, Tailwind CSS\n- Communication: Socket.IO (bidirectional)\n- Storage: JSON files in `/data` directory\n- Auth: Claude auth for SDK\n\n**Diagrams generated**: High-level architecture, component diagram, sequence diagrams (happy path, error handling, reconnection workflow)\n\n**Data models**: ChatMessage, ToolCall, SocketEvent (only 3 objects needed)\n\n**File structure**: Kebab-case naming, products.json/blog-posts.json examples\n\n## Phase 4: PRD-Architecture Alignment\n\nUsed PM agent to check alignment between PRD and architecture. Applied recommendations to ensure story order matched architecture decisions.\n\n## Phase 5: Sharding (PO Agent - Sarah)\n\nUsed PO agent's `shard-doc` command:\n- Sharded PRD → `docs/prd/` (individual files with index)\n- Sharded Architecture → `docs/architecture/`\n\nOriginal files moved to archive directory.\n\n## Development Phase\n\n### Story Workflow Pattern\n\n1. **Scrum Master (Bob)**: `draft story X.Y` → creates story from epic + architecture\n2. **Manual**: Set status from \"Draft\" to \"Ready\"\n3. **Developer (James)**: `develop story X.Y` → implements code, checks off tasks\n4. **QA (Quinn)**: `review story X.Y` → creates quality gate document\n5. **Custom SAT Agent (Taylor)**: `create sat X.Y` → generates human test plan\n\n### Epic 1: Mono Repo Setup (Stories 1.1-1.4)\n\n**Story 1.1**: Initialize npm workspaces and mono repo\n- Created package.json, workspace structure\n- Minor build errors noted but acceptable\n\n**Story 1.2**: Express TypeScript server\n- Server setup with basic endpoints\n\n**Story 1.3**: Basic HTML client\n- Created `/public/index.html`\n- Blue header \"Client Server Communication Test\"\n- Test health endpoint button\n- Form submission without page reload\n\n**Story 1.4**: Socket.IO bidirectional communication\n- Connected/disconnected status\n- Server can push to client\n- Auto-reconnection on server restart\n\n### Custom SAT Agent Creation\n\nCreated **Taylor** (Story Acceptance Test agent) mid-project using second brain documentation about BMAD v4/v6 and Claude SDK.\n\nSAT generates:\n- Terminal commands that can be auto-tested\n- Human visual tests with step-by-step instructions\n\nAgent file: `.bmad-core/agents/sat.md`\n\n### Epic 2: Claude Agent SDK (Stories 2.1-2.7)\n\n**Story 2.1**: SDK installation and authentication\n- Ran into version issues, updated Claude\n- `claude login` → browser authorization\n- Test script: SDK returns \"hello in exactly five words\"\n\n**Story 2.2**: Basic agent event loop\n- Minimal loop receiving messages from SDK\n- System prompt defines \"HTML application building bot\"\n- Initial bug: object [Object] display → fixed\n\n**Story 2.3**: Real-time streaming\n- Chunks come through (SDK streams in chunks, not word-by-word)\n- Tested with rapid-fire prompts (10, 20, 100 counts)\n- Prompts can be queued, responses may arrive out of order\n\n**Story 2.4**: Read JSON tool\n- Initial implementation couldn't discover available files\n- Added **two extra tools**: `list` (show available files) and `preview` (interrogate file contents)\n- Handles malformed JSON gracefully\n\n**Story 2.5**: Write JSON tool\n- Can add products, update fields, create nested files (e.g., `catalog/electronics.json`)\n- Bug: Initially wrote JSON as string (in quotes) → fixed\n- Created new story 2.7 when discovered no conversational memory\n\n**Story 2.6**: HTML file tools\n- Four tools: write HTML, list HTML, preview HTML, serve HTML\n- Issues: Not serving from public directory initially, products not displaying\n- Options A and C selected to fix\n\n**Story 2.7**: Conversational memory (added mid-project)\n- Each SDK call was stateless\n- Read SDK documentation via second brain\n- Now retains context between messages\n\n### AppyDave Workflow Automation\n\nCreated custom workflow to run full story cycle:\n1. Asks which story number\n2. Runs Scrum Master draft\n3. Optional: Validation with PO\n4. Runs Developer\n5. Generates SAT\n6. Runs automated terminal tests\n\nAlso auto-detects last completed story and suggests next.\n\n### Epic 3: React Frontend (Stories 3.1-3.4)\n\n**Story 3.1**: Initialize React with Vite\n- Basic \"Hello World BMAD Claude SDK\"\n- Vite connected, hot module reloading working\n\n**Story 3.2**: ShadCN and Tailwind CSS\n- Basic UI components installed\n- Styling \"very ordinary\" at this point (expected)\n\n**Story 3.3**: Chat interface with Vercel AI elements ⚠️ PROBLEM STORY\n- **14th story** - first with significant issues\n- **Tailwind v3/v4 conflict**: Configured with v3 syntax but was v4 installation\n- **Port conflict**: Claude spawned server on 5174, user expected 5173\n- **Bubble/dropdown styling issues**\n- Postmortem document created as learning resource\n\n**Story 3.4**: Light/dark mode + polish\n- Activity slide-out panel\n- Socket status checks\n- System prompt refinements\n- Multiple iterations to fix styling bugs\n\n## Final Demonstrations\n\n### Demo 1: Opening Demo (shown at video start)\n- Create products → View in backend\n- Create HTML page → See in pages list\n- Add/update products → Instant updates\n- Create home page with navigation\n\n### Demo 2: Bookstore Application\n\n**Products**: Created 5 bookstore products with prices, one out-of-stock\n\n**HTML generation**: products.html created, auto-appeared in pages list\n\n**Dynamic updates**: Added more products → website updated via Socket.IO\n\n**CSS styling**: Created products.css with \"professional blue and gold color scheme\"\n\n**Home page**: index.html with featured products, \"Shop Now\" and \"Chat with us\" links\n\n**Blog posts**: Created blog-posts.json with title, author, date, content, tags\n\n**Blog HTML**: blog.html created using sockets, linked from home and products pages\n\n**Christmas theming**: Applied to products.css with:\n- Snowfall animation\n- Festive red/green colors\n- Required 5 follow-up prompts to work across all pages\n- Used SVG graphics per AI recommendation\n\n**Dynamic content updates**:\n- Added blog post about out-of-stock item going on sale ($32 → $22, only 10 left)\n- Updated product to be in-stock with new price\n- Changed CSS to highlight \"Holiday Special\"\n\n**Conversational memory test**:\n- Message 1: Change title of cat-dog website from \"Cat and Dog Pet Store\" to \"Pet Store\"\n- Message 2: Change every cat product to $100 more\n- Both changes applied correctly, demonstrating memory retention\n\n## Key Insights\n\n1. **Parallel development**: Can work on 2 projects simultaneously while AI generates code (not 3 - first finishes before you can manage)\n\n2. **Custom agents on-the-fly**: SAT agent created mid-project from documentation\n\n3. **Validation prevents hallucinations**: PO's validate-story catches issues before development\n\n4. **Document lessons learned**: Postmortem from 3.3 becomes training data for future\n\n5. **Internal tools only**: Not for public websites - allows AI to modify server\n\n6. **Git for rollback**: Changes committed to repo for version control\n\n## Closing & Next Video Teaser\n\nAll code available in GitHub repository. Community link for daily prompt engineering discussions.\n\n**Next video**: Creating **POEM** (Prompt Orchestration and Engineering Method) - a framework for creating and testing prompts, similar to BMAD. \"I'm AppyDave, see you in the next video.\"",

The application allows users to talk to a chatbot that can generate data (JSON files) and create HTML pages dynamically.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n- Self-editing applications: Apps that can modify their own backend data and generate frontend pages through natural language conversation\n- Context engineering using BMAD Method for structured AI-driven development\n- Vibe coding: Building applications through natural language without writing code manually\n\n**Technical Stack:**\n- Backend: Express.js server with Claude Agent SDK integration\n- Frontend: React with ShadCN, Tailwind CSS, and Vercel AI elements\n- Communication: Socket.IO for bidirectional real-time streaming\n- Storage: JSON files (no database) committed to git repository\n- Authentication: Claude Max account (no API costs)\n\n**BMAD Workflow Demonstrated:**\n1. Project Brief creation with Analyst agent (Mary)\n2. PRD (Product Requirements Document) with PM agent (John)\n3. Architecture document with Architect agent\n4. Story drafting with Scrum Master agent (Bob)\n5. Development with Developer agent (James)\n6. Quality review with QA agent (Quinn)\n7. Story Acceptance Testing with custom SAT agent (Taylor)\n\n**Three Epics Implemented:**\n- Epic 1: Mono repo setup with basic client/server communication\n- Epic 2: Claude Agent SDK integration with tools (read/write JSON, read/write HTML)\n- Epic 3: React frontend with chat interface\n\n**Notable Features Built:**\n- Real-time streaming responses from Claude SDK\n- JSON file CRUD operations through conversation\n- HTML page generation and serving\n- Tool discovery (list files, preview content)\n- Conversational memory (added as story 2.7)\n\n**Key Insights:**\n- BMAD Method allows parallel project development while AI generates code\n- Custom agents (like SAT) can be created on-the-fly for specific needs\n- Validation steps prevent hallucinations and maintain story alignment\n- The approach works for internal tools, not production public websites",
