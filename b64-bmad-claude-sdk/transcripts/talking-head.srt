00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:05,240
So our agent SDK application is built and this is what it can do for us. So we're 

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,520
going into the chat bot where 

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,600
we're going to enter in some products. We should be able 

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,600
to view those products and see that they're being stored in the back end. At any 

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:18,320
time we should be able to create an HTML page. Notice that there's a live activity. 

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,710
There's also live pages. If we click on the 

7
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:25,70
pages, we should be able to go and see the products listing at any time. Then 

8
00:00:25,70 --> 00:00:30,710
we should be able to add a new product or update it, and it should come through instantaneously. 

9
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:35,280
If we need a home page, we should be able to add a link and create a home page at 

10
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,510
the same time. When we go to that home page, we should be able to navigate back to 

11
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,470
the products.

12
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:45,700
And at the end of the video there's a complex multi page workflow demonstration.
