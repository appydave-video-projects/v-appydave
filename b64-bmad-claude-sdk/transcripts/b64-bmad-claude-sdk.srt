00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:05,440
Imagine building a self editing application. What that means is that you could talk 

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,430
to it and it generates all the data in the back end, or you could ask it to visualize 

3
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:16,100
it on HTML pages suddenly materialized. In this video we're going to use the Agent 

4
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:21,230
SDK from Claude Code to do that. And we're going to build this application using 

5
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:24,320
the BMAD method. I'm AppyDave. Let's get into it.

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,280
Now this video is a step by step tutorial, so if you want to move ahead or go backwards 

7
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,280
and forwards, check out the chapter links in the description.

8
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:37,30
Now, what we're building today is this self editing application. We're going to use 

9
00:00:37,30 --> 00:00:40,430
the Claude Agent SDK and the BMAD method.

10
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:44,630
Now, if this all works, what we'll be demonstrating is the idea of creating a bunch 

11
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:49,790
of products, building out a product listing, maybe even a details page for it, adding 

12
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:54,670
a home page, making some of those products featured, and then adding more products 

13
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:55,350
along the way.

14
00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:01,00
Now. The magic of a self editing application is firstly this human experience. So 

15
00:01:01,00 --> 00:01:05,790
we'll be able to talk to the computer, have it generate features, have it generate 

16
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:10,400
data and we'll be doing that using vibe coding sort of techniques. 

17
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:15,80
But the technical reality of this is that we're going to use context engineering 

18
00:01:15,80 --> 00:01:21,240
using the BMAD method, and tools like the Agent SDK to make this application a reality.

19
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,740
Now let's just talk a little bit about the planning ahead of time. So I've already 

20
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:30,330
got a planning folder in place for what we're going to do. I've got some preliminary 

21
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:35,520
tech stack stuff, but I wanna run all of this through the BMAD method. Now, which 

22
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:35,970
version 

23
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,860
of the BMAD method should we use? 

24
00:01:38,70 --> 00:01:42,840
Should we use version four, which is the current, or should we use the version six 

25
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:48,330
alpha nine. Now I tried a video yesterday on alpha eight and I don't 

26
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:53,160
particularly believe it's ready for use just yet for this sort of project. So we 

27
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,350
are going to work with version four, 

28
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:59,820
and that means what we're going to do is use this command here, NPX BMAD Method in 

29
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,960
install. If you do want to use the version six, it's all available 

30
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,460
now the problems I ran into with version six, I've already communicated with Brian 

31
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:13,470
from BMAD and he's aware of it and he's talking through the changes that are coming 

32
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:18,300
in place related to those issues. But for today, we'll keep it simple and work with 

33
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,140
version four.

34
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:24,580
Now in the repo that we're building all this, which is 007 BMAD Claude SDK, you can 

35
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:29,660
go to the bottom and find the links. So here's the link to the version for Bmad. 

36
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:34,540
And if you scroll down a little bit we'll go and select our starting command. With 

37
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,860
that selected we can go over to 

38
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:40,100
our terminal. And I've already got some pages here. 

39
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:45,420
the readme that you were just seeing is in here at that location. And I've got a 

40
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:49,60
planning phase in my documents directory already, 

41
00:02:49,60 --> 00:02:54,500
so we've cleared the screen and putting in the npx bmad-method install. And that's 

42
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,620
going to walk us through a wizard.

43
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:01,980
So let's work through step by step. And the first thing is the folder. Now it's opened 

44
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:07,540
it up to an empty directory. So what I'm going to do is put in the directory where 

45
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:12,930
we're building this application today. After that it's talking about different frameworks 

46
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:18,140
of BMAD that we can install. This all changes a fair bit in version six. We've got 

47
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:23,140
better game set up in that particular version. For now, we'll just go with the agile 

48
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:29,210
core in version four. When it comes to the PRD product requirements document and 

49
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:33,780
the architecture document, you can shard the files, meaning that they can be split 

50
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:38,810
up into individual files after generation. This changes a little bit in version six, 

51
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:40,740
but for today we'll say yes.

52
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:45,540
And then you can decide on what agent coding system you're going to use. I'm using 

53
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,580
Claude Code. So we'll just select that.

54
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:52,140
And in this example we're not going to use Gemini or Codex. So I'm going to say no 

55
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,100
to those models.

56
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:57,810
Now it started off with this idea of reading the user guide. So we'll take a copy 

57
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:02,250
of that and head over to Visual Studio. Now let's have a look at what I already had 

58
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:07,680
in place. So I already have a docs folder with just this planning directory. So there's 

59
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,950
a fair bit of spikes and examples of how this application could work. We'll draw 

60
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:18,180
on that when we are building our product brief. We've got a Claude file in place. 

61
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:18,380
We've 

62
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:22,560
got our Claude sub folder, and you'll notice that there's a area called Command. 

63
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,400
So all the BMAD methods have been set up within this area. 

64
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,800
And then the rest of BMAD is in the BMAD core, where we've got different workflows, 

65
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:37,410
teams, templates for working through checklists. We've got our agents and we've got 

66
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:41,370
this little user guide that it told us to read. So let's pop that up. 

67
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:46,130
We've gotta use the guide for the Greenfield project. So this is a brand new project. 

68
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:51,620
Brownfield is for if you've already got an existing code base. And we can start with 

69
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,120
a project idea. 

70
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,350
we've got an optional analyst research. Now we don't need that because I've already 

71
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:02,60
done all the planning, but we might just work through it temporarily to see what 

72
00:05:02,60 --> 00:05:07,250
it does. Then we've gotta build the brief. So with the brief, we're doing the product 

73
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:12,380
requirements document. We'll do a bit of UX design, we'll do a little bit of architecture 

74
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:15,240
design, and then at the end we'll make it all cohesive 

75
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,180
And with the cohesion in place, that's when we'll start using a scrub master to design 

76
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:24,780
stories and a developer to actually create the code for those stories.

77
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:29,180
So let's start with our terminal and we're going to use Claude Code. And I'm going 

78
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,260
to run it with the dangerously skipped permissions.

79
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:37,420
Now it's fresh context. And we've just added a lot of context from Claude. So I'm 

80
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:42,660
just going to run an init on this. I'm going to give it a little bit of extra information. 

81
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:47,500
We've got this planning folder, but I don't want it to take too much over with the 

82
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,820
Claude file. I want it to be referenced. I want it to maybe use it as a guideline 

83
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,700
for what the project will be about. 

84
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:59,140
But the main focus of Claude should be on the BMAD method and whatever it decides 

85
00:05:59,140 --> 00:05:59,940
to create.

86
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:04,260
So with those two statements, what we can see is that we're improving the Claude 

87
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:10,410
MD to prioritize the BMAD workflow. So what is Claude md? That's essentially the 

88
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:15,540
system prompt. So it's available every time we do a prompt that anything in this 

89
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:19,500
file will be used and we want it to be hyper-focused on what it does. 

90
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:24,750
So anything in red has been removed, and that's a lot of the stuff that I did in 

91
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,940
pre-planning before this video. 

92
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:31,830
We can see that my folder hierarchy that does exist has been removed from the system 

93
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:36,780
prompt, but the important stuff that it's a self editing application is in place 

94
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:41,430
that the core of the server should only be about 200 lines of code. 

95
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:46,650
It's got a very clean understanding of what the BMAD workflow is. So we've got the 

96
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:50,820
workflow primary path. We've got step one, which is installation. Now we've already 

97
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:55,750
done that. We've got step two, which will be the analyst agent doing a workflow-init 

98
00:06:56,190 --> 00:07:00,330
and it just keeps going, doing this hyper-focused system prompt. 

99
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:04,920
So we'll start off by having a fresh version of Claude and we'll put in a slash command. 

100
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:09,990
And the one we're going to go with is analyst and Analyst will load up Mary. Now 

101
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:14,490
there's a lot of things that Mary can do for this session. Mostly we're going to 

102
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:17,220
focus on creating a project brief, 

103
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:21,900
but she's one of these agents that you can spend a long time in just doing all sorts 

104
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,880
of planning and research. 

105
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:29,670
So we just go back to Claude Code and we'll have create a project brief by reading 

106
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:34,770
an existing document. And if we put in the @ sign, we can start putting in Project 

107
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:39,990
Reference and we'll select it and we'll see what she can do with that particular 

108
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:40,380
document.

109
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:45,240
So the Create Project Brief is going to read from our project reference. 

110
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:51,180
And what it does is it uses commands like the Create Doc, which is based on a template 

111
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:53,10
already in the BMAD call. 

112
00:07:53,10 --> 00:07:57,30
And for this we're going to work in the interactive mode. So we'll just press one. 

113
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:02,700
YOLO would be the fast way to do it and with my project documentation it could just 

114
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,180
work out perfectly, but I wanna be pretty sure with this. 

115
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:11,490
So notice that the output file is going to be dots brief and we can see that it's 

116
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:12,650
working through many to do's 

117
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:16,290
Currently it's written the executive summary for it 

118
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:20,400
and I've read it through, it's all pretty perfect. I think the target market says 

119
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:26,40
it all. It's developers learning ai, agent integration and self-modifying systems. 

120
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:31,890
It's for technical educators. That's what I do where I want to generate systems that 

121
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:34,230
are a bit flexible and dynamic pretty quickly. 

122
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:38,280
that's also rapid prototyping. That's what we're doing today. And then we've got 

123
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:43,590
the BMAD method practitioners. Now one thing is to know that I, I'll be testing this 

124
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,900
with version six BMAD 

125
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,110
And if there is anything you want me to test it with, let me know in the comments 

126
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:49,500
below. 

127
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,140
But for now we'll just proceed to the next section. 

128
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:55,680
and the good thing is it started writing the briefs. So we'll just bring up Visual 

129
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:01,260
Studio and click on this file here. And so as it goes, we can keep track of what's 

130
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,300
going on the left hand side, 

131
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:07,110
But let's have a look at this problem statement that it's come up with. 

132
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:11,510
So reading through the problem statement, everything's pretty good. One of the things 

133
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:15,620
I notice is the database. This is where this application will be a little different 

134
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,580
to a lot of applications. It won't have 

135
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:23,400
a database. Instead it's just going to have JSON documents, JSON. They're gonna be 

136
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,950
stored in the server and for saving them, 

137
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:31,370
it's just going to be committed to a repository. Now this is not a normal application 

138
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,380
that you would run in the cloud I guess, 

139
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:38,390
But for me it allows me to rapidly create tools that I use locally on my computer 

140
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:44,150
through a web interface. So I think we can just move on to the next section. And 

141
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:49,400
what it'll start doing is writing an updated brief. We should see it pop in below, 

142
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:54,770
it's updating so we can see a whole new green section. And here it is listed in the 

143
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:55,640
markdown document. 

144
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:00,590
Now if there was anything out of whack with it, rather than using Claude to change 

145
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:04,910
it, you might just manually come in and alter the document here to have 

146
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:07,670
to rectify any flaws that you notice. 

147
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:13,570
It's important also that you do rectify flaws because these propagate through. If 

148
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:16,90
you fix it now you have less issues in the future. 

149
00:10:16,90 --> 00:10:19,840
So the next area we're going to work on is the proposed 

150
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,00
solution section. 

151
00:10:21,00 --> 00:10:25,210
So it's written the proposed solution. If we go over and have a look, we can see 

152
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:29,470
that it's going to use an express JavaScript server. 

153
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:33,430
embedded into it will be a clawed agent, SDK backend. 

154
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:37,600
Some of the tools that we'll have is the ability to read and write JSON files and 

155
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,700
also to write HTML files. 

156
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:44,370
The main front end technology is that we'll use React. We have socket io so that 

157
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:49,720
we can stream information live and we are going to use BMAD method version four 

158
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:54,700
there's also a little note here about using Shad CN for the user interface. We might 

159
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,850
also use the vercel AI elements 

160
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:02,880
Now the backend is meant to be simple, just about 200 lines of code. And one of the 

161
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,810
key requirements is that I can just use it with my max account from Claude. I don't 

162
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:11,410
need to go and pay any API costs with this particular tool. 

163
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:16,540
Now while that's been happening in the background, it's been setting up the target 

164
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:21,100
users. We'll get it to start writing that brief for us. Once it's done, the target 

165
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:26,320
users section, it should move on automatically to the goals and success metrics. 

166
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:31,690
All I've had to do each time is basically say the next number for it to save the 

167
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:32,80
file. 

168
00:11:32,80 --> 00:11:36,850
So the target users have been updated, it should go directly into the next area. 

169
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:41,500
But if we have a look at the target users, we can see that it's a learning system 

170
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,300
for developers. 

171
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:46,500
but I would argue that it's for anyone that wants to learn Context engineering, which 

172
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:51,870
is partly about building applications, but it's about building any system in a business 

173
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,520
or in your personal workflows. 

174
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,800
This is also an area that you could 

175
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,740
pull out, 

176
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:00,220
because I think anyone should be able to learn this. One of the things about what 

177
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:06,160
we're doing is that we're not writing any code ourselves. Everything is just understanding 

178
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,470
a little bit of architecture following a plan and using natural language processes 

179
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,490
the entire way. 

180
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:18,580
So now it's about to create the goals and success metrics. We've already written 

181
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:24,370
all the target user information, it reads the brief each time does what it needs 

182
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:27,730
to do, and then writes the brief again. And you might be wondering, well what does 

183
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:32,380
it need to do? How does it know to do that? And this is just one of the internal 

184
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,690
mechanisms of the BMAD method. 

185
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:40,270
So now the KPIs or the key performance indicators have been updated. We can go look 

186
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:45,00
at it while we move on to the next section. One of the things I would suggest is 

187
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:50,600
in this case, they're not that useful for me. I don't really care about these numbers 

188
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:55,400
here. Thousand developers, clonal Fork, the repository not important to me. 

189
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,540
content amplification if people use it, I'd be really happy about that. 

190
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:04,730
I guess if anything was important is that people are using a sound content engineering 

191
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,710
system, which is BMAD method 

192
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:11,570
but quite frankly, this section is a bit of fluff today for us. But the next area 

193
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,720
is really important and this is the minimum viable product. 

194
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:20,930
And so as a must have, it's working on the idea of it having three epics. Now, this 

195
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:26,290
is not normal by the way. This is not the normal area to put in epics. Usually we 

196
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:32,00
do that after we've done the architecture and the PRD and it comes later. But I put 

197
00:13:32,00 --> 00:13:36,440
this specifically into my planning documents 'cause I'm thinking of this as a simple 

198
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:41,240
application with three different areas that we need to do. We need a foundation that's 

199
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:45,740
the server, the client, it just needs to be set up after that. The backend is the 

200
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,480
main area that we wanna work on. 

201
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:54,410
for the Claude agent SDK implementation, I've already done what's called a core loop 

202
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:55,610
or the event loop, 

203
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:56,00
uh, 

204
00:13:56,20 --> 00:13:57,40
documentation. 

205
00:13:57,40 --> 00:14:00,790
And essentially this is just a human readable list. 

206
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:05,920
It should work no matter what target language this system is built for. Now we are 

207
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,660
going for JavaScript and so hopefully that'll translate pretty readily. And then 

208
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:15,430
the third area is that we're going to have a beautiful user interface. So this is 

209
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:21,550
basically using the Versal and Shad CN and Tailwind CSS and just getting it to talk 

210
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,70
to the backend with streams. 

211
00:14:24,70 --> 00:14:30,790
And as that information hits the SDK perform, any data creation or webpage designs 

212
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:31,360
as we go. 

213
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:36,940
And the next section of the MVP is what not to do. So we don't need a database. We 

214
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:42,430
don't need multi-tenancy multi-user. We don't need authentication or authorization. 

215
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:47,290
We don't need model context protocol. Good thing about using BMAD is that I've used 

216
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:51,790
it for enterprise applications really effectively. So it can do all of these, but 

217
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,410
we're keeping it out of the example. 

218
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:56,530
So after that, we are going to build the 

219
00:14:56,530 --> 00:15:01,820
post MVP or the post minimum viable product vision. And we can see that it's already 

220
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:06,260
come up with most of that. It's got different tools that we might want to add later 

221
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:06,560
on. 

222
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,440
And additional areas like multi-agent workflows, 

223
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,910
production release. Now, quite frankly, I could maybe delete all of the s and b happy 

224
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:19,250
because I'm not planning to go further with this particular project. It's going to 

225
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:23,630
be the foundation for other tools that you'll see me creating using the BMAD method. 

226
00:15:24,50 --> 00:15:28,970
So it's gone off and now thought about the technical considerations. They've all 

227
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:33,80
been set up. It feels that we need to use React version 19. 

228
00:15:33,80 --> 00:15:37,400
And if we look at it in the markdown, it's typescript , Vite and ShadCN, 

229
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,870
tailwind, CSS, 

230
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:42,830
And this is all for the front end. If we look a bit further, we've got the back end, 

231
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:48,590
which is an express server. We've got an installation of the agent SDK planned. We 

232
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:52,790
are going to communicate between the two systems with socket io and we're running 

233
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:58,40
it on node for our database. It's just going to be some Jason documents in the data 

234
00:15:58,40 --> 00:16:02,690
directory future. We could use the database if we like. And the hosting is, it's 

235
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:04,400
just planned to run on local host. 

236
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:09,620
So with that, we can go and look at the next section. It's currently working on the 

237
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:14,900
constraints and assumptions. So this was a big thing for me. Is it going to cost 

238
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,480
me anything? No, I want it to hook into 

239
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:23,660
my max account, and that should be how it works. Develop a time, 40 to 60 hours for 

240
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:24,440
the MVP. 

241
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,800
let's go and look at the risk and open question. 

242
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:33,740
And this is really useful. I've never done the agent SDK, so it is a dependency with 

243
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:36,500
high risk for me when I'm doing this video. 

244
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,330
the constraint, I think 

245
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,900
that the statement here could be true, but I, I don't think it matters. 

246
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:45,800
it's not that I have to do it in 200 lines of code, it's just that I don't want it 

247
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,380
to be complex. That's kind of why I'm doing the constraint. 

248
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,510
I will talk about this section briefly. 

249
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,700
I took out a section called the BMAD, 

250
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:58,40
quality Gates. What I wanted to have happen is that rather than pure vibe coding 

251
00:16:58,40 --> 00:17:03,200
where the user says, I would like a new homepage, I wanted it to actually create 

252
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:09,30
a BMAD story on the backend. Now I think for this demonstration, it's maybe a reach 

253
00:17:09,30 --> 00:17:14,850
goal. Maybe we'll do it. But this would be a really powerful idea that users could 

254
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:19,710
just sit on the front end and say, I want a new capability. And BMAD at the other 

255
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:24,90
end. Here's that and says, well, let me create a story for you and then the developer 

256
00:17:24,90 --> 00:17:27,240
can go off and create it. But for today, I've taken it out. 

257
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:33,150
So that's the docs brief finish. You notice it's now saying to go on to the next 

258
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:38,500
agent. It's got everything written. What we are going to do is exit out. 'cause what 

259
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:44,70
I'd like to do is have a clean context the next time we start. But while we're looking 

260
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:49,830
at that, let's just see what that last section was. So we've got the next step. Immediate 

261
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:54,360
action is we're going to create the product requirements document. We're gonna do 

262
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:59,790
that by loading the project manager agent and running the create PRD command. 

263
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:03,870
Let's also look at what we've got in our system. So everything that you see on the 

264
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:09,360
left in planning is stuff I've done ahead of time. So the only one document we have 

265
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:13,860
in the system specifically created by BMAD is the brief. 

266
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:18,780
Now I'll just take a moment out to suggest that if you want a little bit more handholding 

267
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:25,50
or just seeing day-to-day operations on using the BMAD method context engineering 

268
00:18:25,80 --> 00:18:29,700
to produce applications or other sorts of business systems, then you might wanna 

269
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:33,510
check the link in the description where you can go to my SKOOL community where I'll 

270
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:36,30
be talking about this on a day by day basis. 

271
00:18:36,30 --> 00:18:41,430
But next, let's go and look at creating this PRD. Now, to do that, we're going 

272
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:46,260
to have a new agent. And the agent we want is the project manager. So we load the 

273
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:49,110
project manager in with the slash pm command, 

274
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:53,880
and John comes into existence with a whole lot of capabilities. Now the one we want 

275
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:59,580
is the star create PRD. So we just paste that in and let's see what comes up. And 

276
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:03,810
you notice that the way BMAD works is it works with context documents. So we've got 

277
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:07,650
the Create Doc md. There was also a template going on, 

278
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:12,570
which we can see here, and a bit of configuration YAML now in version six. A lot 

279
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:16,480
of this stuff still happens similarly, but they've made it a lot more flexible.

280
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:21,390
Now, you may notice when you start with a clean Claude Code is that the context is 

281
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:26,150
empty and so certain things it doesn't know about. So this idea of do you have a 

282
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:30,750
project brief which we just worked on is something it doesn't currently know about. 

283
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:34,990
So I'm just going to put in one. That's what we want to do. And I'll put in the @ 

284
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:40,630
sign and start typing brief and we'll just press enter. So it'll use that as loaded 

285
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:41,390
context.

286
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:45,860
So it's read in the brief. I've read it. Everything seems okay to me. So I'm just 

287
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:48,620
going to press one and continue on that. 

288
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:53,570
Notice as it goes, it creates a change log. So we've got version one, which is the 

289
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:56,120
initial PRD created from the project brief. 

290
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:00,50
And now we get into the hearts of what a product requirements document is. We're 

291
00:20:00,50 --> 00:20:05,360
coming up with the functional requirements as we go. So FR one would be the first 

292
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,410
functional requirement. 

293
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:11,960
So it's listing all the basic capabilities that this application is going to do. 

294
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,230
And then after that it does the non-functional requirements, 

295
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:20,960
which is all abstractions or ideas that the system's going to work on, such as the 

296
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:26,60
line limit on the server. The fact that we're going to use CLAUDE Auth to log into 

297
00:20:26,60 --> 00:20:26,510
the system. 

298
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:31,910
Now, like with the interactive mode with product brief, we could just move on to 

299
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:36,950
the next section, but it's got a couple of areas needing validation. Is 200 lines 

300
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:42,710
realistic and should we have prebuilt examples? So I'm just going to make a simple 

301
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:47,900
adjustment here that says the 200 is a suggestion. What I'm trying to do is have 

302
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:53,60
the actual event loop of the agent be fairly small and contained. There's not a lot 

303
00:20:53,60 --> 00:20:57,950
that you need to do there, but this is a guideline. It's not a limit at all. What 

304
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:03,560
I wanted to ensure that it does is not create complex structures as it builds out 

305
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:07,700
this system. 'cause there's nothing complex about the Claude Code event loop. 

306
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:12,80
the other thing I wanted to talk about is this area of, should we have a prebuilt 

307
00:21:12,80 --> 00:21:15,410
example application? No, we shouldn't. This is all vibe coding 

308
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:20,330
that we're going to ask people to do, but we may actually create some examples later 

309
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,310
on. So we'll just press a enter on that. 

310
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:26,700
And so the functional requirements have been updated. We've removed a concept and 

311
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:31,250
we've done slight updates. And so this is a lot more important than in the brief 

312
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:36,260
to get this right. So we'll move on to the next step. But the idea is that this is 

313
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,980
what's actually going to get built.

314
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:42,330
Now the user interface design guides have come through. I've read through all of 

315
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:48,150
this and most of it was good except there was one area and probably the core area, 

316
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:53,640
which is the screens. And this is not working the way I'm thinking. So the first 

317
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,840
thing it says is chat interface, primary screen, full height, chat with message, 

318
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,650
history, input field streaming indicator and example starters. Love 

319
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:07,890
that. That is the only thing that I saw this initial application having. It's then 

320
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:12,690
got concept of a status panel shows active story, recent file operations, quality 

321
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:13,80
gate 

322
00:22:13,80 --> 00:22:17,220
status. Now that's more complexity than I need. 

323
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,670
My thoughts were that as soon as you started typing stuff in here, 

324
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:25,50
You could generate HTML in the back end. And now that doesn't necessarily mean the 

325
00:22:25,50 --> 00:22:27,630
menus would work, but the actual pages should work. 

326
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:32,940
I had a plan for this particular application that BMAD stories would get generated. 

327
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:36,500
That's what the quality gates were. But then I've taken it out, made it a future 

328
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:40,710
thing. So if we go to the very bottom, I said, this section here doesn't make sense 

329
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:41,250
anymore. 

330
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:45,90
and then I've said the next two steps, which are these ones down here, which I've 

331
00:22:45,90 --> 00:22:50,130
copied from above are too complex and I've given it a little bit more clarity on 

332
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:54,530
what to do. So we'll just run with that again. It's so important in this area that 

333
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:58,440
you actually get it stating exactly what you think you wanna see. 

334
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:03,210
So it's come through red is what it's changing. Green is what it's changing it to. 

335
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:09,260
you can see it's continuing with simplified user interface, but we can also go over 

336
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:14,930
to Visual Studio and have a look at the document like before here in a simple markdown 

337
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:20,220
viewer. So BMAD, Claude self editing application. We've got our functional requirements 

338
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:24,920
kicking into place here, and we can see some of the modifications, like the slash 

339
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:31,550
chat and the slash products as examples. So we go back to our conversation, and this 

340
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:35,510
makes a whole lot more sense. We've got the application presents as a minimal chat 

341
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,50
interface. 

342
00:23:36,50 --> 00:23:40,680
We know it can generate concepts like products and blogs, even though there may not 

343
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,280
be a navigation menu in place. 

344
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:47,400
The one little bit of styling we'll have is that it can do dart mode and light mode. 

345
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:51,900
And so we can move on to the next step. There is one big issue in here, and this 

346
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:56,820
is the issue of anyone using vibe coding, is that this application, when we build 

347
00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:01,560
it, will allow us to change our backend server. Now that's both a security issue. 

348
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:06,190
You wouldn't do this on a public website. This is an internal tool, but it means 

349
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:11,830
how do we manage those changes? And I'm assuming in my setup that I'm going to use 

350
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:16,180
Git commit, so I should be able to roll back. But that's not necessarily the most 

351
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:20,710
technically easy thing for people to use. But for this example, that's how I'm planning 

352
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:21,160
to do it. 

353
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:25,720
now here, what it's done is come up with the technical assumptions. They're all based 

354
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:30,490
off the project brief, which is great. I've read through all of them and they're 

355
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:35,140
all very accurate. This is exactly the way I see it happening. But I thought I'd 

356
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:40,00
point out one area. So where did this all come from? It came from something called 

357
00:24:40,90 --> 00:24:41,230
the Storyline app. 

358
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:45,70
Now, I think it's important that we look at the storyline application because the 

359
00:24:45,70 --> 00:24:50,70
catalyst for building this project was could we generate stories dynamically on the 

360
00:24:50,70 --> 00:24:56,920
fly? So if we head over to a web view and we are looking at what is a client and 

361
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:01,690
server sort of system. So currently we are connected to the server and it's using 

362
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:06,820
the same technology we're about to build. And if we go and have a look at our project 

363
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:10,390
files, we've got something called the Boy and the baker. Now the boy and the baker 

364
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:15,250
is a five minute video that we've created. And when you look at it, you can see that 

365
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:20,70
it's the story. And the story starts off with an elderly baker walks into his shop 

366
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:26,10
to see a boy being beaten and bullied by some younger children. So we can see pictures 

367
00:25:26,50 --> 00:25:31,630
of this baker along the way. Now if we go and toggle the image display, we can see 

368
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:37,180
that we got an establishing shot. We've also got other versions of the shot available. 

369
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:42,730
So as we move through this story and it goes for five minutes, all of these images 

370
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:46,300
are character consistent, they're theme and style consistent. 

371
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:51,790
And so we build our movie by using the image prompts with tools like DALE-3 and SORA 

372
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:55,890
2. And we use the animation prompts along the way for doing 

373
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:58,370
the animations in Hailou or VOE 3. 

374
00:25:59,70 --> 00:26:03,690
the interesting thing is that everything that you're seeing is based off this one 

375
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:07,650
narrative. So we've got a little narrative. It creates setting the ambiance, the 

376
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:11,610
characters, the description. We've got the image prompt and we've got the animation 

377
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:15,840
prompt. And I've been going through and refactoring this so that this is a lot more 

378
00:26:16,90 --> 00:26:21,370
deeper. But really I just want to type this into a text box and have all of this 

379
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:24,400
extra information generated for me automatically. 

380
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:28,810
and that's what this application is meant to do. We should just be able to save something 

381
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:33,820
into a text box and have complex data structures form around that information.

382
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:37,780
So let me give you a glimpse of what the application we're currently building can 

383
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:43,660
be used for. And it's this storyline application that generated this movie. We've 

384
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:49,460
got character consistency, scene consistency, and everything was generated using 

385
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:55,540
Claude Code in the background to generate the data structures. So as we start asking 

386
00:26:55,540 --> 00:27:01,460
questions like, can you create three products that will generate complex JSON documents 

387
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:05,460
behind the scene? Well, that's what's happened with the storyline application. But 

388
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:10,980
instead, there's a simple narrative that converts into image and style guides.

389
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:15,980
Now, if you're interested in seeing the five minute video around The Boy and the 

390
00:27:16,20 --> 00:27:20,500
Baker by Voz, then check out the link in the description below.

391
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:23,860
But for now, let's get back to John, our product manager.

392
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:28,960
So I just press one to move forward and we've got our epic list and it looks like 

393
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:33,460
there's going to be three epics, which is what I'd suggested it to do anyway, so 

394
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:37,30
we've got the mono repo set up with basic client and server, 

395
00:27:37,30 --> 00:27:41,470
NPM workspaces. We're can express server, minimal HTML client. 

396
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:45,860
so that looks good. After that, we're really working on the backend, which is the 

397
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:51,50
agent SDK integration. It's going to have the three tools that it talked about 

398
00:27:51,50 --> 00:27:55,500
And then we're gonna polish up the communication with the front end chat interface 

399
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:55,790
here. 

400
00:27:56,00 --> 00:28:01,280
So then we've got our sequencing logic. I think the good bit is the story count. 

401
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:06,860
It's listing three to four stories per epic. There isn't a lot of work in each section, 

402
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:11,30
and then it's listed, it's rationale and decisions. I read through that. This all 

403
00:28:11,30 --> 00:28:12,620
seems to make sense for me. 

404
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:18,220
So at this point, we've got many stories already set up for different epics. 

405
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:24,180
The first one is Monorepo set up with a client and server. So the basic application 

406
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:27,180
structure for the front end talking to the back end.

407
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:32,900
Next we have epic number two, which is essentially setting up the Claude Agent SDK 

408
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:37,140
so that it can communicate from server through to the client.

409
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:41,540
And when you look at the goal, there's also tools included such as talking to JSON 

410
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,380
and HTML files.

411
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:48,460
And the final epic, epic number three is all about building a react front end 

412
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:52,540
and using libraries like Shadchan and Tailwind CSS.

413
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:57,760
Now if we go back to the top of the epic, we'll see that every story follows a common 

414
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:02,710
formula that's designed for agile development. So firstly, we've got a story number. 

415
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:08,200
So in this case it's 1.1. Then we've got a simple title for what the story is going 

416
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:12,250
to be about. This is initializing, the workspace and the mono repo. 

417
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:18,610
So the idea of a user story is this three part formula that says, as a particular 

418
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:23,560
person using the capability, what do they want to achieve? That's the I want. And 

419
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,570
if they did achieve it, what would they get? 

420
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:31,630
then there's an acceptance criteria. So this story is considered complete when all 

421
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:33,610
of these items are checked off. 

422
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:37,780
and this concept's going to repeat through every story in the epic.

423
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:41,900
So what I'll do now is I'll read through every story headline, and then we'll see 

424
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:46,620
pretty quickly that there may be some flaws in the way that it's come up with. So 

425
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:51,940
the first thing it wants to do in the epic is initialize the npm workspaces and monorepo. 

426
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:57,60
That sounds really good. Then it's going to create an express TypeScript server. 

427
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:02,980
After that, it's going to get a very basic HTML client up and running. And finally 

428
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:07,740
we're just going to have a little bit of an end to end test. And mainly that'll be 

429
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:12,700
worked out by starting both servers and checking the browser logs. Checking the console 

430
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:17,740
logs. So so far epic number one looks pretty good. We'll see if it needs any changes 

431
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,580
when we look at the next epic.

432
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:24,380
So now we're moving on to epic two, which is all about setting up the Anthropic Cloud 

433
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:30,260
SDK. And it talks about let's get it installed. Seems like a good first step. After 

434
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:34,140
that, it's trying to implement one of the tools which is the read JSON. Then it's 

435
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:39,100
going to do the right JSON and the right file. And then after all of that

436
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:43,700
we're going to integrate socket streaming. And we're going to do it both for the 

437
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:48,220
server. But we're also going to have the chat messages working with this. And then 

438
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:53,500
after that we're going to implement the full event loop. Now it's this particular 

439
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,140
epic that I'm having a few challenges with, 

440
00:30:56,140 --> 00:31:00,300
and I'll go over what they are soon and how I can change them pretty quickly. But 

441
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,900
let's look at the third epic.

442
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:07,180
Now the third Epic is all about setting up a React application as the front end. 

443
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:14,590
So when we look at 3.1, it's initializing react with VI application. Then 3.2 is 

444
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:20,200
setting up Shad cn, configuring it with Tailwind CSS. After that, we build the chat 

445
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:23,80
interface using the Vercel AI elements. 

446
00:31:23,80 --> 00:31:27,610
And lastly, we're just giving it a simple light mode, dark mode. Now we've got all 

447
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:31,270
sorts of rationale being listed. We could move on from there. 

448
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:36,160
But like I said, I think there's a problem in Epic two. And the main issue is, I 

449
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:41,950
can see is that after installing the SDK, it starts going into setting up tools. 

450
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:46,990
But we haven't defined yet where they fit into the event loop. We don't even know 

451
00:31:47,20 --> 00:31:51,880
whether the event loop is going to work and communicate correctly with the client. 

452
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:56,80
and so as we work through all the stories in Epic two, we're gonna be pretty blind 

453
00:31:56,80 --> 00:32:01,90
to whether they're working until the very end of the epic where it all comes together 

454
00:32:01,90 --> 00:32:02,410
in a big avalanche.

455
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:07,570
So to resolve this problem, I could have a conversation here, but what I find easier 

456
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:10,750
is to just start selecting the context we need. 

457
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:16,480
And what I've done is copied all the way up to when the epic first started. At this 

458
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,670
point, I just select that, put in the clipboard. 

459
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:23,320
After that, I just like to open a new conversation, which I've got down below and 

460
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:27,910
I've started it with the statement. I want you to read and absorb the following information 

461
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:29,680
and then wait for me for guidance. 

462
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:32,440
And that complete epic list has been pasted in. 

463
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:36,850
So that new conversation knows what we've got. We've got it highlighted in blue and 

464
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:41,830
I just tell it that you are going to help me build up an instruction that we can 

465
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,930
put back into the previous conversation. 

466
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:50,170
So the goal of this conversation is purely to build a prompt to paste into this conversation. 

467
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:55,330
But before we get started, I ask it to do a bitof a Q&A session with me to get clarity 

468
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,340
around the problems as I see it. 

469
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:03,100
I tell it that I'm pretty happy with Epic one. I think it's good, but I think there's 

470
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:07,90
stuff that's we're going to talk about in Epic two that will impact it. So I just 

471
00:33:07,90 --> 00:33:11,650
prepare it to know that it can change Epic one even though at the moment it's pretty 

472
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:12,10
good. 

473
00:33:13,00 --> 00:33:18,160
After that I went through Epic two and each of the stories and I just gave it this 

474
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:23,590
long diatribe. Now I was just dictating directly into the microphone. It was writing 

475
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:28,450
out everything as we go. And so the good thing about this is it can make it more 

476
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:33,340
readable for me. So the first thing it does is start to unpack the issues that I 

477
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,570
had addressed. 

478
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:35,980
figured out that stories 

479
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:40,150
2.2, 2.3 and 2.4 can't be properly 

480
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:42,160
verified until we've done the event loop. 

481
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:46,690
It also worked out that the event loop is not a single story. There's both a beginning 

482
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:52,690
and an incremental development of it before it finishes. It identified from my conversation 

483
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:58,810
that what was called story 2.4 was actually two different concepts. One was the streaming 

484
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:03,730
client area, the other was the same streaming client, but specifically for the agent 

485
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:04,450
SDK. 

486
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:09,820
And this also led it to understanding that 1.4 might need some modifications. 

487
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:14,920
Now, because I asked it to do a q and A system, it actually came up with four pretty 

488
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:19,690
solid questions. But one of the things I noticed while reading them was it, it kind 

489
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:24,880
of suggested the answers as it went. So it's a question of is it asking me questions 

490
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:29,50
or does it already have good recommendations and I just need to sign 'em off. 

491
00:34:29,50 --> 00:34:34,250
So I just told it that the questions it's asking, I already thought it had the answer, 

492
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:37,900
could you just give me the recommendation? It just saves me a lot more time than 

493
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,370
actually engaging in the Q&A. 

494
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:46,280
And so it wrote these recommendations. So the minimum viable event loop after 2.1 

495
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:51,650
becomes this idea of create a basic event loop. And there's no tooling, no streaming, 

496
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:54,590
there's just the fact that it can receive messages fromthe SDK 

497
00:34:55,550 --> 00:35:00,590
at the moment, at the end of Epic one, we're just doing HTTP requests, but it thinks 

498
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:04,340
that it might be useful to put in some socket functionality at that point. 

499
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:09,710
It now feels that the event loop that we're building is a bunch of capabilities that 

500
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:11,690
can be done as multiple stories, 

501
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:18,70
And we can move the tools that we want to do into 2.4 to 2.6. And when I look at 

502
00:35:18,70 --> 00:35:23,500
that, I realize that even before we move on to Epic three, if I wanna build in other 

503
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:28,70
capabilities like Claude skills, this Epic will be the right way to go. 

504
00:35:28,90 --> 00:35:33,280
because it's designed in such a way that each cross-cutting concern or aspect can 

505
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,890
be added one at a time later on if needed. 

506
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:40,150
So it's already figured out a much better plan. But remember that the initial part 

507
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:43,570
of this conversation was can you create the instruction for me? 

508
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:48,310
So I just tell it down the bottom here and I'll press enter that. This is perfect. 

509
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:53,170
I love the way it's thinking. What it needs to do is now create those instructions 

510
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:58,90
that we want to put back into the top conversation. And just so you know, that top 

511
00:35:58,90 --> 00:36:02,960
conversation is this one that's here. We're going to take whatever's comes out of 

512
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,250
this conversation and drop it straight into here to modify it. 

513
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:10,840
So here's our detailed instruction set. We can just go all the way to the bottom 

514
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:17,800
with this. We'll make a copy of it, come up here and paste it in 203 lines of information 

515
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:20,590
just by asking a couple of questions. 

516
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:25,190
So it was already started working on things. One of the interesting things is it's 

517
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:28,840
also playing around with the product requirements document right here. 

518
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:34,960
So the changes we asked for have been implemented. We've got a change to story 1.4 

519
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:41,560
and we've got a whole new re reordering and breaking up of Epic two. And what the 

520
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:46,360
number of stories really tell us is how many development sessions are going to go 

521
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:46,930
on because 

522
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:50,930
We'll get the scrum master and the developer to work on each of the stories sequentially, 

523
00:36:51,50 --> 00:36:53,570
starting from one and going through to number 14. 

524
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:59,480
So quickly looking at the PRD, we've got the new Epic list. It's the monorepo set 

525
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:04,220
up, the agents or the server in the backend and the front end client. And then we've 

526
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:09,360
got all the details coming through one story at a time. These are just simple stories. 

527
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,810
They'll be converted into full blown stories with the scrum master. 

528
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:18,240
and then add streaming and logging as we go. And then after that we can do the tools 

529
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,570
And then finally connect it all up to the React front end.

530
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:27,170
So with the very complete epic list in place, we'll come back to our conversation 

531
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:30,900
and just move on to the next step, which is the checklist. 

532
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:36,230
So what the checklist has done is just read the PRD. Now this is from a product owner 

533
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:41,400
or a product manager's point of view. So this is all the business cases have been 

534
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:45,800
covered. We haven't yet gone to the tech stack or the software architect's point 

535
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:50,510
of view. That's the next area. But when we look at it, it says it's 92% complete. 

536
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:51,170
There's, 

537
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:53,700
problems with it, but it's mentioned that 

538
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:58,710
the user research area isn't really that relevant for a demonstration like this. 

539
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:03,990
So I won't worry about it. And so everything else has passed except for this area 

540
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:04,890
in the MVP. 

541
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:09,930
So any blockers to moving forward? Well, there's none identified. Are there any high 

542
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:14,520
level issues that we should be aware of? I think this is one we might address, but 

543
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,60
we'll do it 

544
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:19,830
asking a recommendation rather than actually taking the time to define it, because 

545
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:24,240
the AI will probably do a better job than me at coming up with an answer anyway. 

546
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:29,190
These medium level issues don't really matter to me. Like the target user doesn't 

547
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:32,940
matter. And the success metrics don't matter in this particular project. 

548
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:36,840
Now my background has been software engineering, software architecture, and even 

549
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:41,100
for a time a scrum master. So these numbers that you're seeing here, the, 

550
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:46,680
23 days to get this application written are legitimate numbers. This is about how 

551
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:51,750
long it would take to do a project like this if you were doing it in an enterprise 

552
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:55,530
system. But at the end of the video, I'll tell you how long it's taken to do the 

553
00:38:55,530 --> 00:39:00,420
documentation and to do the coding. So we'll see what numbers really come back. So 

554
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:06,480
I've just dictated a little statement about the outer scope area, like what does 

555
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,620
it suggest we put in there? And I've also said that for the logging, I don't want 

556
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:15,810
to use a logging framework, but I wouldn't mind simplistic patterns predefined before 

557
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:16,680
we get started. 

558
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:21,630
And this is perfect. This is just what I didn't want to actually type in myself. 

559
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:26,700
So we're not going to use database and persistent authentication. Authorization isn't 

560
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:31,740
needed. It's not for production testing. Infrastructure is not important in this 

561
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:32,550
process. 

562
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:37,920
advanced features like quality gate hooks, all this sort of stuff was all outta scope 

563
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,490
for me. 

564
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:42,240
it doesn't need to be a polished ui though. I hope it'll be pretty good with shad 

565
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,280
CN and Tailwind CSS 

566
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:50,70
logging and monitoring is also really good. It's come up with just a simple JavaScript 

567
00:39:50,70 --> 00:39:54,220
logger platform. It's not trying to use libraries or anything like that. 

568
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:59,620
So I'm just asking it to update the PRD with all the changes. The only little change 

569
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:05,80
I mentioned is that the hot module reloading, which is a developer experience, 

570
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:10,90
changes like modifying a bit of code and seeing it updated directly in the client 

571
00:40:10,90 --> 00:40:13,510
is a really nice capability to have in the application 

572
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:16,90
So we're all complete with our PRD. 

573
00:40:16,90 --> 00:40:20,440
at this point it's suggesting that we hand off to the architect. We could do it in 

574
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:25,240
this conversation, but what we'll do is we'll just exit out a Claude and 

575
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:31,390
and start a new Claude session because we wanna have a clean context to get up and 

576
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:32,770
running with the architecture.

577
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:37,120
Now I just wanna point out some basic maintenance that I like to do with working 

578
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:40,630
with Claude. So I've just put in this little prompt here 

579
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:46,180
And the reason is that we've created a brief, we've created a PRD, but my initial 

580
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:51,190
system prompt, or the Claude prompt is pointing to the planning phase of the system. 

581
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:56,680
But now that BMAD method has done these great documents, I want to ensure that my 

582
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,810
Claude file knows about them. 

583
00:40:58,810 --> 00:41:04,900
And so it's taken some old ideas, like the planning documents and the BMAD execution 

584
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:10,30
guide, which are, now, this one's not relevant anymore, and this one's just lower 

585
00:41:10,30 --> 00:41:14,320
priority. So it said, we've got the brief, we've got the PRD, and then we've got 

586
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,160
the planning guide. 

587
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:18,780
Now a lot of changes being made, but if we go down the bottom and have a look at 

588
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:20,230
the summary, we can see 

589
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:25,150
that our system prompt has a very clear understanding of everything we've done right 

590
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:25,480
now. 

591
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:30,490
one of the other things I noticed is that it knows that the next step is going to 

592
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:35,620
be the architecture. So if we come down and we will clear out again and start with 

593
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:37,270
a new Claude context, 

594
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:40,840
we'll go straight into the architecture agent, let it load, 

595
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:45,430
and we can move into creating things. So we don't need the backend architecture and 

596
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:49,510
front end individually. We just need the full stack architecture. 

597
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:52,150
So we'll just pace that in and kick it off.

598
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:56,680
So the architect is going to generate our architecture at this location. 

599
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:00,940
in the dots folder, it's read the project brief, it's read the PRD. 

600
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:04,540
We have a basic introduction and it's worked out for 

601
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:09,250
starter templates that while it's based on a different idea, there is no starter 

602
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:09,700
template. 

603
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:12,670
So for us, it's just going to put in a change log and 

604
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:16,90
we can move on to the next section, which is the main architecture. 

605
00:42:16,90 --> 00:42:18,400
So it's written out a lot of information. 

606
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:23,440
I've read through it all. It's pretty much just restating a lot of the stuff we've 

607
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:27,370
already got. We've got a technical summary, we've got the platform and infrastructure. 

608
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:29,830
One of the things that it notices is 

609
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:30,850
that for an MVP, 

610
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:35,980
we don't need any complexities like a platform or infrastructure service approach. 

611
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:40,690
We've got some sort of interesting graph that's going to show up in our markdown 

612
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:41,230
document 

613
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:45,250
and a list of the architecture patterns and the rationale. At that point, we can 

614
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:48,640
just move on to the next section, which is building the tech stack. 

615
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:52,390
So it currently has a written the mark down documents. A lot of this is a little 

616
00:42:52,390 --> 00:42:56,280
unreadable, but we've got the full tech stack table going on 

617
00:42:56,290 --> 00:43:02,50
and again, we've got rationale summary, including the key technology choices. We've 

618
00:43:02,50 --> 00:43:06,610
got the trade offs of not having concepts like caching and the database we are going 

619
00:43:06,610 --> 00:43:07,210
to use, 

620
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:11,830
version P pinning. So it should be recording what version it's on, like react 19. 

621
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:16,720
And these ideas could be important if we're using an MCP to go and get documentation 

622
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:22,870
around react or express. It needs to know what version to work with. Now if you are 

623
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:27,250
actually coming from a point of view where you don't fully understand all the terminology 

624
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:32,530
going on, remember there are other ways that you can deal with this documentation. 

625
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:36,820
So you can use chain of thought, all sorts of q and a sort of stuff. I understand 

626
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:41,50
generally the technology going on, so I'm just pressing one to move forward. 

627
00:43:41,50 --> 00:43:46,440
So now it gets into the data models, and this is just a transport or usage of data 

628
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:51,690
in the system. So the first idea of the chat interface and the fact that it might 

629
00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:55,690
have a ID such as the user or the AI bot. 

630
00:43:55,690 --> 00:44:00,70
content and status. This is all great. The only thing I'm a little concerned about 

631
00:44:00,70 --> 00:44:03,150
is does it match with the Vercel AI elements? 

632
00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:08,560
got a section, the tool calling, so the reading of the Jason, writing of the Jason, 

633
00:44:08,590 --> 00:44:11,560
and then just messaging between client and server. 

634
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:17,30
So it's only identified three different objects that we need, the chat message tool 

635
00:44:17,30 --> 00:44:20,900
call and the socket event. So with that, I'm just gonna move forward. 

636
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:26,840
So we can now just move on to the API specification. The only thing I was looking 

637
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:33,170
at here, which I thought interesting, is that we are using this bio directional communication 

638
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:37,420
pattern. Now, I don't know how much I'm going to be changing specifically on the 

639
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:39,920
server that I need to send back to the client 

640
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:44,440
because I know this was based off a different application, the storyline app that 

641
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:48,280
I talked about, where a lot of that would happen. But I think this will work pretty 

642
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:48,760
cleanly. 

643
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:53,690
So now it's just working out all the different components where it thinks the files 

644
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:59,690
are going to be as it builds out the application. One of the interesting things about 

645
00:44:59,690 --> 00:45:03,680
doing it this way is that when we go back and look at the PRD, 

646
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:09,670
we may find out that the order of doing things, which the PRD will list might be 

647
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:12,850
in conflict with some of the architecture decisions. 

648
00:45:12,850 --> 00:45:17,830
Now in version six of the BMAD method, they deal with that with a section called 

649
00:45:17,830 --> 00:45:22,810
solutioning. I don't think it existed in version four. So we'll deal with that ourselves 

650
00:45:22,810 --> 00:45:23,680
when we get to it. 

651
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:28,480
We can also see here that there's a big component diagram being created that we can 

652
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:29,860
go and look at a bit later. 

653
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:33,680
so it's pretty good. It's come up with the idea that there's a data directory and 

654
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:38,750
that's where it's going to put JSON documents based on the ideas I've already told 

655
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:39,230
it about. 

656
00:45:39,230 --> 00:45:41,450
It's got the concept of products, 

657
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:46,880
it's got the concept of blog posts, maybe it needs some configuration. So if we needed 

658
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:51,950
to do a homepage and it had a logo or a theme, that's where that sort of information 

659
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:52,490
could go. 

660
00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:57,710
It's given a sample file structure talking about the idea that files should be in 

661
00:45:57,710 --> 00:46:03,320
kebab case and that it's essentially just an array of JSON objects. 

662
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:07,500
Though we can see with that one that that's more just a general object. 

663
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:13,560
Now there's no schema validation. So this system could be brittle or fragile in the 

664
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:17,370
real world, but I think for the use cases we're doing, it'll work pretty well. 

665
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:20,10
And if we did want a more strict 

666
00:46:20,10 --> 00:46:24,600
rules system, we could introduce something like Zod or some sort of schema to make 

667
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:29,790
sure that any data being written or read from always follows a certain format. 

668
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:35,310
So we'll just move on to the next area. One of the things we can see here from our 

669
00:46:35,310 --> 00:46:39,150
trade-offs is that this is not designed for big systems. 

670
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:43,140
is really just a little internal tool that I want to use it for at the moment. 

671
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:48,420
So it's come up with a plan for our front end components. We've got the chat interface, 

672
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:53,790
we've got some generic UI controls. We've got the idea of the sockets. 

673
00:46:53,790 --> 00:46:58,770
It'll just be a single page application, no router involved, 

674
00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:05,700
and a bunch of static HTML pages. I think the big issue we might have there is keeping 

675
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:10,830
style consistency when we generate things and we haven't catered for that, but we'll 

676
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:13,860
see how it goes when we start running the application. 

677
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:16,590
So plenty more examples coming through. 

678
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:21,810
So we're nearly done with the architecture. We've just put in the system backend. 

679
00:47:21,810 --> 00:47:26,100
We've got the agents, how they're all going to work. We've got the tools that we 

680
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:31,890
need to work with a couple of utilities, plenty of example code coming through, 

681
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:34,740
more diagrams being added to the system. 

682
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:39,00
so we can see here it's going to have a native NPM workspace. 

683
00:47:39,00 --> 00:47:42,750
we're going to have three packages. So we've got the server client and the shared 

684
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:43,710
types going on. 

685
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:47,10
Now the full workflow from the command line has been listed. 

686
00:47:47,10 --> 00:47:49,480
got node NPM, we've got the Claude Auth. 

687
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:55,800
This will allow us to hook up our agent SDK to our local Cluade account. 

688
00:47:55,800 --> 00:48:00,900
It plans to have a single line to get it all up and running, just NPM Run Dev. We'll 

689
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:05,610
start both the server and the client. And now we're onto the remaining sections. 

690
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:08,400
So we've got the deployment strategy coming through. 

691
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:13,290
We've got a continuous integration, continuous development pipeline, but it's very 

692
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:15,510
empty. There's nothing really going on just yet. 

693
00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:20,820
Conversations about environment, we've got security coming through, we've got performance 

694
00:48:20,850 --> 00:48:22,290
metrics, we've got 

695
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:27,600
all the testing approaches just documented as future. They're not in place just yet, 

696
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:31,470
but we do have sample code of what it could look like in the future. 

697
00:48:31,470 --> 00:48:35,880
and then we've got the error handling strategy. We've got a diagram and we've got 

698
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,560
sample codes to work with that.

699
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:42,360
Now we've got a two and a half thousand line document created. It's quite extensive. 

700
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:47,610
If we jump over to VS code and look at it, we can see it's got concepts like the 

701
00:48:47,610 --> 00:48:51,630
high level architecture. We've got diagrams being generated. 

702
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:55,890
We can see that the plan is for the user to interact with the browser and for that 

703
00:48:55,890 --> 00:48:56,640
to talk 

704
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,410
to the agent event loop. 

705
00:48:58,410 --> 00:49:03,720
The agent event loop should then be doing any tool calling that it needs to do and 

706
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:09,570
returning information. Back to the Chat GPT stream. We've got the ability to write 

707
00:49:09,570 --> 00:49:10,980
different files as we go. 

708
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:16,20
Whole lot of architectural patterns. We've got the defined tech stack. Very extensive 

709
00:49:16,20 --> 00:49:17,970
data models are defined 

710
00:49:17,970 --> 00:49:20,280
and clearly written out using TypeScript. 

711
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:25,500
We've got the custom tool utilities, which are integrated into the SDK right here. 

712
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:30,930
Then we move into components related to the front end and how it communicates with 

713
00:49:30,930 --> 00:49:31,560
the back end 

714
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:35,670
because the shape of data on both the front end, the back end can be the same. We've 

715
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:38,880
got a shared types to transport that data 

716
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:43,560
and then we get a visualization of the components on both the front end and how they 

717
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:48,420
communicate through to the back end. And we can see a little bit of where the shared 

718
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:49,680
components meet. 

719
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:54,540
Now we've got a sequence diagram that's showing us the way data flows through the 

720
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:59,10
system, and this is based on the happy path, meaning what happens when nothing goes 

721
00:49:59,10 --> 00:50:05,280
wrong. We've then got examples of the tool invocation. This is the writing of Jason. 

722
00:50:05,490 --> 00:50:09,510
Then the error handling workflow. So this is the unhappy workflow. 

723
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:14,790
Now the thing with web sockets is that they can stop working. So we've got a reconnection 

724
00:50:14,790 --> 00:50:16,110
workflow coming through 

725
00:50:16,110 --> 00:50:20,490
and examples of if I had the product catalog working, what it would all look like, 

726
00:50:20,490 --> 00:50:25,920
the writing of the product JSON as an example. Then it talks about database schema. 

727
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:29,670
Well, we don't really have one, but we do have a storage architecture. It's just 

728
00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:34,710
going to be files and samples of what in this case, products could look like 

729
00:50:34,710 --> 00:50:39,570
blog posts and the configuration for the system and just how the files are going 

730
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:43,620
to be laid out. Then it's documenting what we're not going to have. So we don't have 

731
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:47,130
schema validation. We don't have in-depth and performance, 

732
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:50,670
sorted out. We're not using caching. We'll just, 

733
00:50:50,670 --> 00:50:55,560
the data that we store will just be version controlled in GitHub. Then we've got 

734
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:58,590
a full list of what the front end architecture's going to look, 

735
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:03,940
followed by component templates. So when it needs to write a component, it can use 

736
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:08,320
the component template. To start there, we've got the state management architecture 

737
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:14,170
up on the client. So this is the examples of how the client can talk to the backend. 

738
00:51:14,170 --> 00:51:18,730
And this has all been listed through here. We've got the routing organization. Now 

739
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:23,140
remember, we don't have a router. This is just a single page application, but we 

740
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:26,320
do have concepts like dealing with static HTML, 

741
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:26,440
and 

742
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:30,940
Then we move on to the backend architecture. We've got the files that are planned 

743
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:35,560
to be created. We've got an example template for what a controller could look like 

744
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:38,740
storing of data. We'll use the repository pattern, 

745
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:43,870
but it'll be file-based persistent. And then we've got authentication and authorization 

746
00:51:43,870 --> 00:51:49,630
flows, which is really just the CLUADE authentication for the SDK 

747
00:51:49,630 --> 00:51:50,320
kicking in 

748
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:56,290
simple little middleware guard. But generally we don't have any authentication going 

749
00:51:56,290 --> 00:52:00,280
on. And then we've got the full unified project coming through right here. 

750
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:06,250
So with all this information done, the next thing to do is just to confirm that our 

751
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:11,980
PRD that we've created is actually going to match with the architecture that we've 

752
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:18,880
got now in version six of BMAD method. They have a section called solutioning, which 

753
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,280
takes care of that, but we'll do it manually today.

754
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:26,620
Now I'm just going to go into the PM and we're just going to ensure that we've still 

755
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:32,260
got alignment between the PRD and the architecture because the PRD was created before 

756
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:39,520
the architecture. So I've just told John the PM to check that the architecture document 

757
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:45,220
and the PRD are in alignment. Main thing I want to ensure is that the PRD is still 

758
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:50,470
in the right order based on the architecture. I also wanna see if any of the stories 

759
00:52:50,470 --> 00:52:55,90
or the epics or anything needs to change based on what we did with the architecture. 

760
00:52:55,90 --> 00:52:59,410
if you are using version six of the BMAD method, this is called solutioning. It's 

761
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:01,420
just something I tend to do manually 

762
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:03,760
because I found it effective in the past.

763
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:09,130
So it's finished the alignment with the architecture document. It's listed a bunch 

764
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:14,350
of areas I've read through them all and they're very minor. So I think the main thing 

765
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:15,310
that we can do 

766
00:53:15,310 --> 00:53:21,250
is just apply number one, which is the recommendations to the PRD can be applied 

767
00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:21,790
right now. 

768
00:53:21,790 --> 00:53:28,450
So those minor alignment issues are now being fixed between the PRD and the architecture. 

769
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:32,560
What we're going to do now is change over to the po, 

770
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:37,600
the product owner. And this is because we wanna shard the documents. Now, if I just 

771
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:43,720
jump down to this view here, sharding is the idea of splitting up a big document 

772
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:48,670
into little documents. And a few of the agents can do sharding, but the one that's 

773
00:53:48,670 --> 00:53:54,700
designed to do for both architecture and PRDs is the po. And that's why we've jumped 

774
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:55,360
over to there. 

775
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:59,650
And we can see the command here, it's called shard-doc, followed by the document 

776
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:04,150
we wanna work with and the destination that we wanna put it in. So we'll start by 

777
00:54:04,150 --> 00:54:10,960
typing in shard-doc and I'll put in the at sign and type in the PRD. And after that 

778
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:15,580
we'll put it into a file that doesn't currently exist, which is why I haven't used 

779
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:18,100
the at sign. It's docs, PRD. 

780
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:21,760
Now, while that's doing that, we'll head over to VS code to see what's going on. 

781
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:27,100
So it's this big document that we've got going on here and we're moving it into this 

782
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:30,670
folder and you can see everything being split up 

783
00:54:30,670 --> 00:54:35,170
and there should be a little index that points to where all the different parts of 

784
00:54:35,170 --> 00:54:40,600
that file exist. So with that done, we go back and we run the shard-dock again. This 

785
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:43,330
time we're going to click on architecture, 

786
00:54:43,330 --> 00:54:48,340
and if we head over, we should get an architecture folder being generated. And we've 

787
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:52,30
got all the indexes pointing to each individual file as well.

788
00:54:52,30 --> 00:54:56,30
Now we're about to get into development, but we should have a look at what our docs 

789
00:54:56,70 --> 00:55:01,590
look like. So we have the brief that was generated. We've split the PRD out into 

790
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:06,150
individual files. We've done the same thing for the architecture, but I haven't gotten 

791
00:55:06,150 --> 00:55:10,750
rid of those files. So I've moved them into an archive directory, and I've left the 

792
00:55:10,750 --> 00:55:15,950
planning document because that's got a lot of detailed files that we can lean on 

793
00:55:15,950 --> 00:55:19,230
if we need to at the time of generating the stories.

794
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:25,320
So now we are ready to start developing our application. So to get started, we need 

795
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:30,960
the scrub master and the scrub master will read through the Epic and create the first 

796
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:36,300
story for us. And that can be done by using this command here called Draft. So what 

797
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:37,860
we'll do is we'll type in draft 

798
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:41,970
and we could say something like Draft first story in this case. 

799
00:55:41,970 --> 00:55:47,970
So I've got draft first story from first Epic, and if we go over and have a look 

800
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:49,140
at the Epics list, 

801
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:54,30
The first one is the mono repo set up with the basic server and client. 

802
00:55:54,30 --> 00:55:59,730
So we can see it starting to gather architecture context. Here. We've got all the 

803
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:01,830
different documents that we've created 

804
00:56:01,830 --> 00:56:04,890
in the architecture folder being read as needed. 

805
00:56:04,890 --> 00:56:09,60
It's the ensuring for the first time that we've made the stories directory. Now I've 

806
00:56:09,60 --> 00:56:10,320
already done that manually. 

807
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:15,870
Now keep in mind that from the epic point of view, it's only got this basic information 

808
00:56:15,870 --> 00:56:21,450
to start with. So it's drawing from that, followed by all the architecture documents. 

809
00:56:21,450 --> 00:56:24,780
and we now have our first story in draft mode. 

810
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:29,640
And we can see that it's grabbed from the Epic, the story card and the acceptance 

811
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:34,680
criteria. And from that, it's just developed a bunch of tasks and sub-task to work 

812
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:34,860
with. 

813
00:56:34,860 --> 00:56:40,200
It's aware that there's no story to start off with. This is the first one. It accesses 

814
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:44,760
the tech stack. We've got the project structure that it's meant to be creating. We 

815
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:47,10
understand the work space that we're in, 

816
00:56:47,10 --> 00:56:51,990
and it's gone and prepared some shared types. So it's grabbing a lot of this information 

817
00:56:51,990 --> 00:56:53,700
from the architecture document, 

818
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:58,320
setting up the naming conventions and the coding standards. And it also understands 

819
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:03,540
how to set up the types script configuration. It's filled in an area for testing, 

820
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:08,250
which at the moment we don't have any testing. And so at this point, we could start 

821
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:12,840
doing development. Now the normal flow in an application would be to read through 

822
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:18,720
this and check everything is okay. For now, I'm just going to change this from draft 

823
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:23,160
to ready and hit save. And then we can go back to Claude 

824
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:27,360
where we can start doing our development. Now it needed to be in that ready mode, 

825
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:31,530
so we've done that. So we'll just switch over to the development agent 

826
00:57:31,530 --> 00:57:36,810
and we can just type develop story. Now I'm going to put in the 1.1 because it'll 

827
00:57:36,810 --> 00:57:41,730
make it easier for it to find the correct document without having to look through 

828
00:57:41,730 --> 00:57:42,750
documents. 

829
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:47,170
And now it has a plan of of what it's going to work through. So it's going to set 

830
00:57:47,170 --> 00:57:53,50
up our package, Jason, create the workspace directory structure for us, move on to 

831
00:57:53,50 --> 00:57:57,970
configuring type script, create the workspace package.json, and 

832
00:57:57,970 --> 00:58:03,940
create the shared types. We'll do the .gitignore. And then finally it'll verify that 

833
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:06,370
the mono repo has been set up correctly. 

834
00:58:06,370 --> 00:58:11,890
So it's finished developing all the code, it makes a statement that everything is 

835
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:16,450
in place. It's a little bit hard to test because we don't actually have any source 

836
00:58:16,450 --> 00:58:18,280
code just yet. But when 

837
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:23,590
the story has been updated with a lot of check boxes of the work that's been done. 

838
00:58:23,590 --> 00:58:25,810
When I personally run the 

839
00:58:25,810 --> 00:58:30,610
build, I got a couple of errors, but they're actually listed here. So that's okay. 

840
00:58:30,970 --> 00:58:35,680
All the files have actually been created. So at that point we can close off this 

841
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:36,100
story.

842
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:41,350
Now you might notice at the end of the story there's an area for the QA agent. So 

843
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:44,530
what we can do is go back over type in 

844
00:58:44,530 --> 00:58:47,890
/qa for the quality assurance agent. 

845
00:58:47,890 --> 00:58:51,940
Now, this is not an agent I would normally use in my own projects. What I have a 

846
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:58,00
custom agents more for story acceptance testing and that's about generating a document 

847
00:58:58,00 --> 00:59:03,70
for the human to work through and test different things that would be visual in nature. 

848
00:59:03,70 --> 00:59:08,710
But for this video, we would use the QA agent and we'll just do a review on 1.1. 

849
00:59:08,710 --> 00:59:13,810
I mentioned that I'd normally do a story acceptance test plan. Now that doesn't preclude 

850
00:59:13,810 --> 00:59:18,340
doing normal tests as well. So usually when you are developing an application, you 

851
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:19,630
wanna have unit tests. 

852
00:59:19,630 --> 00:59:24,340
you might want to have end-to-end tests, but definitely you need some sort of a test 

853
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:29,80
plan at the end of the story that says these are the things that you have to go and 

854
00:59:29,80 --> 00:59:29,470
look at. 

855
00:59:29,470 --> 00:59:33,910
And in a more complex application. I like it to actually walk me through and say, 

856
00:59:33,940 --> 00:59:38,440
first click on this menu, fill in this piece of information. And all of this information 

857
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:40,360
can be derived from a story. 

858
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:44,920
And if it was something I was doing with this project, the way it would look is that 

859
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:50,740
it would create a new file right next to the story. So we've got 1.1 dot story, but 

860
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:52,360
I would have a 1.1.story-SAT. 

861
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:59,200
And in that would be all the guidance and instructions for me to go and visually 

862
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:00,940
check that everything's working. 

863
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:06,310
Now, currently we can see that the QA agent has come in and started to update the 

864
01:00:06,310 --> 01:00:06,820
document. 

865
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:12,880
So we now have our overall quality assessment in place. Everything seems to be okay 

866
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:17,740
and one of the interesting statements is this one right here. So it's just talking 

867
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:22,990
about future considerations that'll be important with new stories. Now if we go back 

868
01:00:22,990 --> 01:00:29,50
to our VS code, we can see that the story has been updated with all this extra quality 

869
01:00:29,50 --> 01:00:30,10
assurance checks.

870
01:00:30,10 --> 01:00:33,370
So with our first story down, we'll do a commit 

871
01:00:33,370 --> 01:00:38,680
and we can see that there's all the new configuration and set up for the mono repo. 

872
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:45,130
Plus there's all the architecture PRD and the initial story has been added as well. 

873
01:00:45,130 --> 01:00:50,380
We'll set up a new Claude code and the first thing we need to do is make sure we're 

874
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:51,640
on the scrum master 

875
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:57,550
and we'll type in draft story 1.2 and let it go and build that new document for us. 

876
01:00:57,550 --> 01:01:02,500
now light before it goes through a template loads in information from the Epic that 

877
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:07,570
we're on story 1.2 loads in all the technical architecture documents 

878
01:01:07,570 --> 01:01:12,460
also reads from the previous story so it knows what's already been done. 

879
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:15,610
So story 1.2 has been drafted, 

880
01:01:15,670 --> 01:01:21,40
I just had a quick look through the document. So I've set the status to ready, but 

881
01:01:21,40 --> 01:01:25,480
we've got our acceptance criteria, we've got all of our subtask in place, 

882
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:31,90
so now it's time to develop. We just go back, I've already set up the development 

883
01:01:31,90 --> 01:01:36,10
agent and we'll just type in develop story 1.2 and let it run. 

884
01:01:36,10 --> 01:01:40,600
now while that's running, I'll just talk about the idea of working with multiple 

885
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:45,910
projects at once. One of the things I love about BMAD is that if you are generating 

886
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:51,70
two different applications, you've got a fair bit of time while the development is 

887
01:01:51,70 --> 01:01:56,410
going on. So you saw what I did, I set up the story, then I switched over to the 

888
01:01:56,410 --> 01:01:58,540
developer agent and I kicked it off. 

889
01:01:58,780 --> 01:02:03,400
At that point I'll go to another terminal where I've already got BMAD running on 

890
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:08,110
a different project and goes through the same process. Now, personally, I can't do 

891
01:02:08,110 --> 01:02:12,490
three projects at a time because usually the first project has finished 

892
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:16,870
and I've gotta go back and manually review it. But the good thing is that you can 

893
01:02:16,870 --> 01:02:20,200
be working on two different applications at the same time. 

894
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:25,120
So we'll just come back and have a look at what it's doing and we can see that as 

895
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:30,430
it goes, it's signing off on tasks that it's done and it just keeps working through 

896
01:02:30,430 --> 01:02:30,580
them. 

897
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:31,780
So it's finished. 

898
01:02:31,780 --> 01:02:35,680
the development, the definition of done has been filled in. 

899
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:40,210
We got some new files. What we'll do is we'll jump over to the quality assurance 

900
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:45,400
agent. So again, we are going through a number of code quality metrics 

901
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:51,200
and we can see a list of the changes that wherever it says this story. And we can 

902
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,30
go and have a look at the code over here. 

903
01:02:53,30 --> 01:02:57,560
Now, if you're a developer, this is an area that you probably spend a lot of time 

904
01:02:57,620 --> 01:03:01,790
looking. I work more as a software architect and so 

905
01:03:01,790 --> 01:03:06,500
while it would be smart for me to check all the code, I usually don't check the code. 

906
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:11,420
And that's an interesting thing about this. I've built complete enterprise applications 

907
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:17,240
and I spend more time working on the documentation to check the code quality. Then 

908
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:19,730
I do in actually looking at the code. 

909
01:03:19,730 --> 01:03:24,620
Now, the agents I use for that, I'll talk about in future videos. At the moment, 

910
01:03:24,620 --> 01:03:26,810
we're just trying to build a simple application. 

911
01:03:26,810 --> 01:03:29,660
So all the completion notes have been filled in. 

912
01:03:29,660 --> 01:03:35,60
we know the files that have been changed and now the QA has come in. So if we go 

913
01:03:35,60 --> 01:03:41,780
and open up QA and look at the Quality Gate number 1.2, we can see a YA L file. On 

914
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:46,850
the changes though, it's a lot easier to see it back in the Claude context window.

915
01:03:46,850 --> 01:03:53,30
Now at this point we could be moving on to 1.3, but I suspect there might be something 

916
01:03:53,30 --> 01:03:58,490
in this code that we could test that we can see if it's working. But the problem 

917
01:03:58,490 --> 01:04:00,350
is that we don't have a list 

918
01:04:00,350 --> 01:04:05,690
that we can check. So I've gone and set myself up a new window. This is a conversation 

919
01:04:05,870 --> 01:04:07,490
I have with a second brain. 

920
01:04:07,490 --> 01:04:11,600
and the second brain has knowledge about things like BMAD version four and version 

921
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:12,50
six. 

922
01:04:12,50 --> 01:04:18,410
And I've had it just construct for me instructions for creating a story acceptance 

923
01:04:18,410 --> 01:04:19,370
testing agent. 

924
01:04:19,370 --> 01:04:23,570
Now, I'll just point out behind the scenes what's really going on is that if we do 

925
01:04:23,570 --> 01:04:29,390
a tree, you can see all the different documents that I've got available on Claude. 

926
01:04:29,390 --> 01:04:34,130
So we've got the SDK here, we've got Claude code, we've got skills. And you can also 

927
01:04:34,130 --> 01:04:39,260
see stuff on BMAD method. We've got mostly V four, but we've also got information 

928
01:04:39,260 --> 01:04:40,610
on V six as well. 

929
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:44,540
and it's through having access to that information plus the project we're working 

930
01:04:44,540 --> 01:04:49,520
on that we've been able to build these instructions. So what I'm going to do is just 

931
01:04:49,790 --> 01:04:52,610
take all the information down to the bottom 

932
01:04:52,610 --> 01:04:59,810
and we'll just go into our current conversation and say, can you create a new agent 

933
01:04:59,810 --> 01:05:03,860
for me within the BMAD system? I'm going to paste the information in 

934
01:05:03,860 --> 01:05:08,780
so that's coming through, and we'll paste all that information and let it go. Now 

935
01:05:08,930 --> 01:05:12,80
if this was version six of BMAD, 

936
01:05:12,80 --> 01:05:18,470
you would have access to a system called BMB, which is the BMAD module builder. And 

937
01:05:18,470 --> 01:05:23,150
if we go back to our second brain, you can see where I've got that information. There 

938
01:05:23,150 --> 01:05:28,760
is this BMB folder that allows you to create agents for different workflow modules. 

939
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:34,130
But because we're in V four, we don't have access to that module. And so I've just 

940
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:35,390
let it come through. 

941
01:05:35,390 --> 01:05:39,530
So what I'm going to do is select the command we've got, I've copied it into the 

942
01:05:39,530 --> 01:05:46,790
clipboard, and it says that if we run it, we should see some blue timestamp ISO 8 6 0 1 

943
01:05:46,790 --> 01:05:52,880
format. So what we'll do is we'll jump over to a terminal, we'll paste it in and 

944
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:59,330
see what happens when we run it. And yet certainly does, we've got some line console 

945
01:05:59,390 --> 01:06:00,80
items here. 

946
01:06:00,80 --> 01:06:04,460
So the good thing is we can see what the application is meant to do based on what 

947
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:08,780
the story says it should do. Now this is a little bit different to a user acceptance 

948
01:06:08,780 --> 01:06:13,700
to test because this will change from story to story. Something that would've been 

949
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:20,900
a UAT in say 1.1 might now be defunct and not useful in 1.3. So it's not quite the 

950
01:06:20,900 --> 01:06:26,480
same as A UAT, which is generally for the life of the application. This is only for 

951
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:27,530
the life of the story. 

952
01:06:27,530 --> 01:06:32,930
So now we'll come down to AC four. This is about checking the health of the server. 

953
01:06:33,230 --> 01:06:39,510
Apparently if we hit the a i Health endpoint, we should get a status. Okay, so I'm 

954
01:06:39,510 --> 01:06:43,20
just coming up to a terminal and we'll run it. And yes, 

955
01:06:43,20 --> 01:06:44,910
it's saying status. Okay, 

956
01:06:44,910 --> 01:06:49,620
so that's just a quick demonstration on how you can create your own agents. So at 

957
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:53,910
any time it's easy to just say, model it after something, give it a little bit of 

958
01:06:53,910 --> 01:06:59,400
instructions on what to do. One of the things I find with that particular agent that 

959
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:05,310
I did is that some of those commands like was the terminal blue is not something 

960
01:07:05,340 --> 01:07:10,140
I need to visually check, but I could get the AI to do it. So I tend to split it 

961
01:07:10,140 --> 01:07:14,940
up into two groups. Those that I have to go and check out myself, like entering in 

962
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:17,10
a form, did I see an error message 

963
01:07:17,220 --> 01:07:21,480
versus the ones that could just be tested by Claude Code itself. 

964
01:07:21,510 --> 01:07:25,890
But hang on, you might be saying, what about playwright or end-to-end tests? Could 

965
01:07:25,890 --> 01:07:30,750
you set them up? And the answer is yes, you can. You probably should. But I find 

966
01:07:30,750 --> 01:07:35,550
that they're quite hard to get going. They're very fragile. So they're always breaking 

967
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:41,190
and you spend more time wasted around in debugging them. Where then all you really 

968
01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:45,660
want in this particular case is do the forms work the way the story said they were 

969
01:07:45,660 --> 01:07:50,640
going to be implemented? And I need to test it visually anyway. I can't purely rely 

970
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:55,440
on E two E testing. And this is where the SAT agent is really good. 

971
01:07:55,440 --> 01:08:00,480
So at that point, I've just come back to Claude code and what we are going to do 

972
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:02,880
is just do a commit and push this up. 

973
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:08,100
So what I've done is started a new claude code. We've gone over to the scrum master, 

974
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:10,680
we started drafting story 1.3. 

975
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:13,380
So it's finished creating the story. 

976
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:18,720
let's head over to Visual Studio. I've already set it to ready. I think after it 

977
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:22,530
gets through the task. The main thing that we're going to want to look at is the 

978
01:08:22,530 --> 01:08:27,450
fact that there's now a HTML page. So we should be able to see something. Apparently 

979
01:08:27,450 --> 01:08:31,650
there's going to be a little bit of JavaScript going on, so let's go back and start 

980
01:08:31,650 --> 01:08:32,160
developing. 

981
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:33,900
So I'm just letting it, 

982
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:39,30
load up the developer and once that's done, we can just develop story 1.3. 

983
01:08:39,30 --> 01:08:43,920
So now the development is finished. It looks like we're going to have an index file 

984
01:08:43,950 --> 01:08:49,890
that we can go and look at. We will do the SAT soon, but let's just go over to the 

985
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:51,360
QA bot for a moment 

986
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:54,420
and we'll run our review on 1.3. 

987
01:08:54,420 --> 01:08:59,130
While that's running, we'll just do a quick check of the document. It says all the 

988
01:08:59,130 --> 01:09:03,780
tasks done, there should be a public directory. We've got the HTML index. We've got 

989
01:09:03,780 --> 01:09:06,60
script tags coming through. 

990
01:09:06,60 --> 01:09:10,110
In a moment we should see an update to the QA results. 

991
01:09:10,110 --> 01:09:15,930
So the QA results are in. We've got a new gate file. We can see the story. We will 

992
01:09:15,930 --> 01:09:17,820
check an SAT soon. 

993
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:19,860
There's updates to the packages. 

994
01:09:19,860 --> 01:09:24,540
the client application now has an index HTML page going on. 

995
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:31,80
so let's go and test our story acceptance spot. We should be able to type in SAT 

996
01:09:31,170 --> 01:09:33,180
and we've got sat. 

997
01:09:33,180 --> 01:09:39,780
So currently Taylor is loading into memory. We've got a create SAT command available. 

998
01:09:39,780 --> 01:09:42,780
We've also got an update, SAT command. 

999
01:09:42,780 --> 01:09:48,150
Now we'll kick off the create and this command, this one here that we haven't used 

1000
01:09:48,150 --> 01:09:53,40
yet is just in case. I don't like the instructions that the current bot has. We've 

1001
01:09:53,40 --> 01:09:55,80
got the ability to update the bot. 

1002
01:09:55,80 --> 01:10:01,170
So this is reading our SAT is reading the story. That's going to be the source of 

1003
01:10:01,170 --> 01:10:05,850
truth. It's also looking at some of the code that's been created, like the client 

1004
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:07,230
index, HTML. 

1005
01:10:07,230 --> 01:10:13,80
And at the end of this, we should have a new file just sitting next to 1.3 story. 

1006
01:10:13,80 --> 01:10:18,700
So it's just created it. Let's pop it open. So the story itself was about creating 

1007
01:10:18,700 --> 01:10:22,840
a basic HTML page. And the human test that we can do 

1008
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:24,670
requires us to run the server, 

1009
01:10:24,670 --> 01:10:26,680
which I've just done. And then it wants 

1010
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:27,10
to go 

1011
01:10:27,10 --> 01:10:28,300
to the chat window and 

1012
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:32,800
We should see a blue header called Client Server Communication test. Let's just bring 

1013
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:33,160
it up. 

1014
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:39,700
that looks like it. And it's also got a text input box saying, enter a message optional. 

1015
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:40,00
Yep, 

1016
01:10:40,00 --> 01:10:40,810
That's in place. 

1017
01:10:40,810 --> 01:10:43,570
and a blue button labeled test health endpoint. 

1018
01:10:45,310 --> 01:10:50,620
I was also saying gray response area with test response will go here. I wonder if 

1019
01:10:50,620 --> 01:10:51,220
it works. 

1020
01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:55,750
Now we'll come back to having a look at our form. We've got some things around styling. 

1021
01:10:55,750 --> 01:11:01,300
I'm not that concerned about that. What's this form? Submission without a page reload 

1022
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:07,300
should just say server response status is okay. And apparently there's no page reload. 

1023
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:11,980
So we will bring up our website and we'll click on test endpoint. 

1024
01:11:11,980 --> 01:11:16,990
And there wasn't a refresh, but we did see the server response update. 

1025
01:11:16,990 --> 01:11:21,340
Apparently there's a bonus visual test. We can stop the server, 

1026
01:11:21,340 --> 01:11:27,10
which I've just done. And if we click on test health endpoint, we get failed to fetch, 

1027
01:11:27,190 --> 01:11:28,630
make sure the server is running. 

1028
01:11:28,630 --> 01:11:34,390
So that's really cool. I wasn't planning to create the SAT agent as part of this 

1029
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:39,100
video, but this is the idea of it is that you don't have to think about what the 

1030
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:44,380
code did. It tells you what has happened and tells you how to reproduce it, 

1031
01:11:44,380 --> 01:11:49,360
which just saves you a heap of time when you are using the BMAD method to develop 

1032
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:50,170
an application. 

1033
01:11:50,170 --> 01:11:55,360
We'll come back to our terminal where I was running that server and we'll just clean 

1034
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:58,600
up after ourselves. So we'll do a bit of a commit right now 

1035
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:02,200
and we've got a great commit message. Everything's listed. 

1036
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:08,360
So for story 1.4, I've just run everything at once. I haven't done any testing yet. 

1037
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:12,120
We started off with Bob, the Scrum Master. He created the story.

1038
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:17,560
I went a little bit premature into Taylor for the story acceptance test, because 

1039
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:22,320
that can be derived from the story, but it should also be done after the development. 

1040
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:29,240
So I needed to do a bit of an update later. I also ran James to develop all the code, 

1041
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:32,320
and then did Quinn to do the quality assurance.

1042
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:38,800
So the new documentation files are that we have a story, we have an SAT and we have 

1043
01:12:39,00 --> 01:12:44,520
a Q&A document. And from a code point of view, we've got new files plus a little 

1044
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,320
bit of an update to the Readme.

1045
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:52,320
So we can see the endpoints that we want to test, but if we go and look at the SAT 

1046
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:54,60
plan, we've got 

1047
01:12:54,60 --> 01:12:59,610
a little bit of console logging that we should see in chat, and we should see some 

1048
01:12:59,670 --> 01:13:05,460
server responses. If we type anything into the chat window, apparently it can also 

1049
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:08,550
handle a disconnection. So let's go test them out. 

1050
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:15,240
So here's our web application will hit refresh, and it's saying that we're currently 

1051
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:15,960
connected. 

1052
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:21,600
let's just say AppyDave here, press enter and we're getting a response received. 

1053
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:27,330
I've just asked it to kill the server over in Claude code because I think it's running 

1054
01:13:27,330 --> 01:13:32,700
in the background over here. I didn't actually start it and look at that. It's starting 

1055
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:34,800
to say that it's disconnected. 

1056
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:39,690
What I'll do is restart it from the terminal myself, and if we come back to our web 

1057
01:13:39,690 --> 01:13:43,80
application, hopefully it just automatically reconnects.

1058
01:13:43,80 --> 01:13:48,480
So at this point, we're right at the very end of the epic. So number one is done. 

1059
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:54,320
We've done stories one, two, three and four from the epic. Now at this point we might 

1060
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:59,640
want to do a retrospective. This is something that you would do in agile development 

1061
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:06,320
I recently talked about that in a video. So this video here how to make your AI Coding 

1062
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:12,440
Partner Smarter was an AI retrospective that I did a few months ago on Bmad. This 

1063
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:17,840
has now been implemented into Bmad, so you'll see that in the version six once that's 

1064
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:21,240
available. Otherwise you can watch this video to see how it works.

1065
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:25,560
But for now, we will just move straight on to epic number two.

1066
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:31,320
So at this point we have finished our first feature, our first epic in the system. 

1067
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:38,00
We have this client and server application. It uses Socket.io and has bidirectional 

1068
01:14:38,00 --> 01:14:42,720
communication, meaning that we can type something in the text box and it immediately 

1069
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:47,440
hits the server. Or if the server was to want to communicate with the client, it 

1070
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:48,640
could do that as well.

1071
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:53,400
Now all the code and prompt sequences are available up on the GitHub repo. If you 

1072
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:57,400
want to access that, there's a link to my community down below.

1073
01:14:57,400 --> 01:15:02,760
Now next up we're going to work on epic two, which is the Claude Agent SDK. And what 

1074
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:08,240
that's going to allow us to do is put the equivalent of Claude Code into our server. 

1075
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:12,960
So all the sorts of stuff you've seen me doing with Bmad, which is creating code, 

1076
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:18,600
writing documents, doing research. Hopefully we can do that from our own application 

1077
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:23,840
so that we can build HTML pages and we can generate product and blog posts content.

1078
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:28,700
So we'll head back to Claude Code and we've got our scrum master set up and we're 

1079
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:31,250
going to draft story 2.1. 

1080
01:15:31,250 --> 01:15:37,280
And so we have our story created. It's as a developer, I want a Claude agent, SDK 

1081
01:15:37,340 --> 01:15:39,260
installed and authenticated, 

1082
01:15:39,260 --> 01:15:45,170
so that I can integrate the agent driven conversational capabilities into the application. 

1083
01:15:45,320 --> 01:15:50,300
Now we'll do one extra step this time and we're going to go over to the product owner 

1084
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:56,390
agent. And with this we are going to run this validate story, draft 2.1, and what 

1085
01:15:56,390 --> 01:15:56,990
that'll do 

1086
01:15:56,990 --> 01:16:02,900
is run a validation on the story that we've already done. And what it's really attempting 

1087
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:08,990
to do here, and this is an optional task, is just ensure that there were no hallucinations 

1088
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:12,440
or mistakes made in generating the story. 

1089
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:17,960
Now, I don't normally do the validation system because it slows down my general workflow, 

1090
01:16:18,50 --> 01:16:23,660
but sometimes what you notice is that code goes off the rails and if you'd have done 

1091
01:16:23,660 --> 01:16:27,440
the validation, you would've saved yourself a lot of headaches. So let's have a look 

1092
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:33,320
at what the validation system is trying to do. So firstly, it's an anti hallucination 

1093
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:34,760
protection is going on, 

1094
01:16:34,940 --> 01:16:35,930
what it does is a QA 

1095
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:38,660
against just inventing stuff. 

1096
01:16:38,660 --> 01:16:42,980
Then what it does is make sure that all the documentation it needs is in 

1097
01:16:42,980 --> 01:16:45,200
internally stored within that story. 

1098
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:49,910
And then finally a whole lot of checks and balances on the template and the sequence 

1099
01:16:49,970 --> 01:16:50,870
of the story. 

1100
01:16:50,870 --> 01:16:56,270
so use the product owner agents validate story with discretion, like when you think 

1101
01:16:56,270 --> 01:16:57,290
something's complex, 

1102
01:16:57,290 --> 01:17:02,30
because this will save a lot of future headache if things go off the rails during 

1103
01:17:02,30 --> 01:17:06,920
the development cycle. Now so far we've gone through a full epic without any issues, 

1104
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:10,910
so I didn't really need to do it, but I thought I'd just throw it in so you can see 

1105
01:17:10,910 --> 01:17:11,510
what it does. 

1106
01:17:11,510 --> 01:17:17,330
So after that, we go into developing the 2.1 task and everything was going really 

1107
01:17:17,330 --> 01:17:22,460
well, created all the code that we needed, ran the definition of done checklist, 

1108
01:17:22,460 --> 01:17:25,160
and this is when a bunch of warnings popped up. 

1109
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:30,50
So you can see here that there's an external dependency that we need, which is to 

1110
01:17:30,50 --> 01:17:35,210
authenticate into Claude. So we'll just open up a new terminal window and we'll paste 

1111
01:17:35,210 --> 01:17:36,470
that in and see what happens. 

1112
01:17:36,470 --> 01:17:42,140
So I ran into a couple of problems doing authentication and apparently I was on the 

1113
01:17:42,140 --> 01:17:45,770
wrong version of Claude. So what I've done is an update and I'm going to take you 

1114
01:17:45,770 --> 01:17:52,610
through the workflow. As it stands, I've just logged into 2.0 0.42 and I'm just going 

1115
01:17:52,610 --> 01:17:56,360
to do a logout. So this ensures that we are now out of Claude. 

1116
01:17:56,360 --> 01:18:00,350
And down below I've created a little test, SDK script. 

1117
01:18:00,410 --> 01:18:00,530
and 

1118
01:18:00,530 --> 01:18:05,360
we're seeing an SDK test fail because we're not logged in. So what we'll do is we'll 

1119
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:06,290
come back up here 

1120
01:18:06,290 --> 01:18:10,970
and we'll run the login function and we'll say yes and yes, 

1121
01:18:10,970 --> 01:18:15,980
we're using our browser subscription. So we can just come up and click on the authorized 

1122
01:18:15,980 --> 01:18:16,370
button 

1123
01:18:16,370 --> 01:18:20,690
and we'll come back to the terminal. It says we're signed in, so let's clear this 

1124
01:18:20,690 --> 01:18:22,10
and try it again. 

1125
01:18:22,10 --> 01:18:26,960
And it's just going to say hello in exactly five words and hopefully it gets something 

1126
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:31,70
back. And so now we can see that our SDK is actually working.

1127
01:18:31,70 --> 01:18:38,270
So at the moment the 2.1 story is finished. If we go and look at the main story acceptance 

1128
01:18:38,270 --> 01:18:43,470
tests that we need to look for, it's just that we've got colored timestamp with the 

1129
01:18:43,510 --> 01:18:49,590
Agent SDK running successfully. If we go down to our terminal, we can see that entry 

1130
01:18:49,590 --> 01:18:53,910
just here. So from a terminal point of view, the server seems to be working.

1131
01:18:53,910 --> 01:18:57,110
All of our acceptance tests have worked. 

1132
01:18:57,110 --> 01:19:02,190
And the little test tool that was created is also returning valid data that the authentication 

1133
01:19:02,190 --> 01:19:03,30
is working.

1134
01:19:03,30 --> 01:19:08,830
Now for story 2.2, the basic Agent event loop. I've run this ahead of time and so 

1135
01:19:08,830 --> 01:19:13,470
we'll go straight into testing it. So here we can put in a message. I'm going to 

1136
01:19:13,470 --> 01:19:20,270
say can you help me with the cloud SDK. We'll press send to agent and you'll see 

1137
01:19:20,270 --> 01:19:24,630
a message coming through here. And currently it's saying processing.

1138
01:19:24,630 --> 01:19:29,870
And we've got this great formatted HTML response. I'd be happy to help you with the 

1139
01:19:29,870 --> 01:19:36,350
SDK. However I need to clarify that I'm an HTML application building bot, 

1140
01:19:36,550 --> 01:19:41,590
And the messaging that's here happens to be because of a system prompt that was created 

1141
01:19:41,590 --> 01:19:42,870
in the last story.

1142
01:19:42,870 --> 01:19:47,520
So let's go and check out the flow that we did in conversation. And you can see that 

1143
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:49,830
we started off with the scrum master 

1144
01:19:49,830 --> 01:19:53,580
and we just asked Bob to draft story 2.2. 

1145
01:19:53,580 --> 01:19:58,200
And with the story created, we can see that it's about doing the minimal event loop 

1146
01:19:58,200 --> 01:20:00,240
for communicating with the SDK. 

1147
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:05,400
And we can already see from the success criteria that we were able to send a message, 

1148
01:20:05,430 --> 01:20:06,330
see it logged, 

1149
01:20:06,420 --> 01:20:06,660
and then 

1150
01:20:06,660 --> 01:20:08,520
see it displayed in HTML. 

1151
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:11,520
Now the main file created will be the agent event loop. 

1152
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:15,660
And we've got this solid readiness score and we've also got a list of things that 

1153
01:20:15,660 --> 01:20:20,160
the development could do. But we'll notice at the bottom that it does suggest that 

1154
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:25,410
we could use a validation. We don't really have to with this sort of story, but I've 

1155
01:20:25,410 --> 01:20:29,70
run one. So we look at Sarah, the technical product owner, 

1156
01:20:29,70 --> 01:20:31,290
we can then validate the next story. 

1157
01:20:31,290 --> 01:20:36,780
Now it's just comparing the story to other documents in the system, previous documents 

1158
01:20:36,780 --> 01:20:41,340
goals, making sure that everything's in alignment. Everything's great. There's one 

1159
01:20:41,340 --> 01:20:44,460
little yellow flag here, so we'll go have a look at it. 

1160
01:20:44,460 --> 01:20:46,980
There's a slight little question here, 

1161
01:20:46,980 --> 01:20:51,540
but we won't worry about it in the story or rectifying it because the development 

1162
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:53,790
agent, we'll figure this out pretty easily. 

1163
01:20:53,790 --> 01:20:58,110
And so next we just install the dev agent, which is James, 

1164
01:20:58,110 --> 01:21:01,920
and then we can just run the develop story command. 

1165
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:07,230
As James gets all the work done, it's all being marked off on the task list. 

1166
01:21:07,230 --> 01:21:10,710
The story document is being filled in along the way 

1167
01:21:10,710 --> 01:21:15,60
and we're seeing a little bit of a state change in the document, just making sure 

1168
01:21:15,90 --> 01:21:16,830
that it's now ready for review. 

1169
01:21:16,830 --> 01:21:21,00
We see confirmation of what was either created or modified. 

1170
01:21:21,00 --> 01:21:26,10
And so with the code complete, I just now need a plan of action written up for me. 

1171
01:21:26,10 --> 01:21:31,530
So the story acceptance test is what will kick off. This is that new agent we created. 

1172
01:21:31,830 --> 01:21:34,590
We've loaded it up, Taylor is in place, 

1173
01:21:34,590 --> 01:21:40,800
And we just run the create story acceptance test for 2.2. So a new document is created 

1174
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:46,410
and that helps us understanding things like what are the new files or the modifications 

1175
01:21:46,410 --> 01:21:48,720
going on if we want to go and have a look at the code, 

1176
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:54,610
a writeup of what the code is, plus a little bit of key implementation details just 

1177
01:21:54,610 --> 01:21:54,970
to help, 

1178
01:21:54,970 --> 01:21:57,700
just so that you can understand it a little bit easier. 

1179
01:21:57,700 --> 01:22:02,560
So we'll go and have a look at that document. We've got the acceptance test guide 

1180
01:22:02,620 --> 01:22:07,300
with the prerequisites, how to set it up. And then we go straight into the human 

1181
01:22:07,300 --> 01:22:07,900
test. 

1182
01:22:07,900 --> 01:22:12,520
And we started all of this off by running this particular test where we saw the information 

1183
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:15,610
coming through, we saw the log messages coming through. 

1184
01:22:15,610 --> 01:22:17,560
Now you got to see the happy path. 

1185
01:22:17,740 --> 01:22:19,660
if we put in, hello, can you help me? 

1186
01:22:19,660 --> 01:22:23,440
We'd get some sort of clean response coming back from the agent SDK. 

1187
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:30,10
So what I did for the acceptance Test eight happy path is I pasted in the console 

1188
01:22:30,10 --> 01:22:30,310
log, 

1189
01:22:30,310 --> 01:22:35,890
with a little bit of a message saying that I don't see anything suggesting that this 

1190
01:22:35,890 --> 01:22:37,510
actually got all the way through. 

1191
01:22:37,510 --> 01:22:42,130
It said that I probably need to do a hard reset on the HTML. So I did that 

1192
01:22:42,130 --> 01:22:47,200
and I started getting a response. This was very good, except what I was seeing was 

1193
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:50,380
object, object all the way through the response. 

1194
01:22:50,380 --> 01:22:55,60
So I just asked it, was it expecting that that was all we were going to get? 'cause 

1195
01:22:55,60 --> 01:22:58,270
I didn't go in thorough enough reading the story to know whether 

1196
01:22:58,270 --> 01:23:02,530
I was going to get clean data. It said, no, it's not right. So went and made some 

1197
01:23:02,530 --> 01:23:04,30
modifications to the code. 

1198
01:23:04,30 --> 01:23:08,560
It first started by suggesting what those modifications were, and then it made the 

1199
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:10,00
changes automatically. 

1200
01:23:10,00 --> 01:23:12,730
And that brings us to where we are at the moment 

1201
01:23:12,730 --> 01:23:17,20
where we can now put in a message, we'll say, what do you think would be a good application 

1202
01:23:17,410 --> 01:23:19,270
to build with the Claude SDK? 

1203
01:23:19,270 --> 01:23:22,690
And we've got a conversation, a stream that makes a whole lot of sense. 

1204
01:23:22,690 --> 01:23:27,670
and remember that this agent is paired with a system prompt, which is about building 

1205
01:23:27,670 --> 01:23:28,750
web applications.

1206
01:23:28,750 --> 01:23:34,910
So we clean up the end of the story by just using the QA agent, which is Quinn, and 

1207
01:23:34,910 --> 01:23:38,870
we ran the review story to build this quality Gate document.

1208
01:23:38,870 --> 01:23:43,670
So we have this audit trail of things that have happened, including that the initial 

1209
01:23:43,670 --> 01:23:46,30
implementation did have a failure in it.

1210
01:23:46,30 --> 01:23:50,790
Now I've just implemented 2.3, which is real time streaming. And one of the interesting 

1211
01:23:50,790 --> 01:23:56,870
things is I was also able to create a BMAD workflow to do all the work for me in 

1212
01:23:56,870 --> 01:24:01,150
one sequential flow. We'll look at that in a moment, but for now, let's just test 

1213
01:24:01,150 --> 01:24:01,470
it out.

1214
01:24:01,470 --> 01:24:07,30
So I've created a bunch of testing prompts that we can work with. The idea is that 

1215
01:24:07,30 --> 01:24:11,550
I want to see chunks come through the system. So we'll go and select this particular 

1216
01:24:11,550 --> 01:24:17,110
one and come back to our web form. Now I've made a minor change to the system prompt 

1217
01:24:17,110 --> 01:24:21,470
so that it has a command called test. What I want it to do is ignore the idea that 

1218
01:24:21,470 --> 01:24:26,150
it's a web application building agent. And we'll just paste this information in. 

1219
01:24:26,190 --> 01:24:31,190
And it's starting to write some information. And you can see here it's saying processing 

1220
01:24:31,190 --> 01:24:32,30
at the moment.

1221
01:24:32,30 --> 01:24:36,230
And all of this has been done in one chunk. So

1222
01:24:36,230 --> 01:24:41,150
the interesting thing about the Claude Agent SDK is that you can't stream word by 

1223
01:24:41,150 --> 01:24:46,150
word. It is done in chunks. So it's a little bit slow between updates, 

1224
01:24:46,150 --> 01:24:50,510
But you can see that the streaming is working between where my initial message came 

1225
01:24:50,510 --> 01:24:52,550
through, and then the agent got involved.

1226
01:24:52,550 --> 01:24:58,230
We'll try a different version where we're testing of reading the package.json. We've 

1227
01:24:58,230 --> 01:25:03,470
got I'll help you read the package.json. So we see chunk zero coming through right 

1228
01:25:03,470 --> 01:25:03,830
here. 

1229
01:25:04,270 --> 01:25:06,910
and now it'll do an analysis MD. 

1230
01:25:06,910 --> 01:25:10,710
And we can see the three chunks coming through over in the console log.

1231
01:25:10,710 --> 01:25:16,50
So the last test is what would happen if we bombarded it with ideas. So I'm going 

1232
01:25:16,50 --> 01:25:21,450
to put in number 10 and we'll press enter. Then we'll paste and we'll put 20 and 

1233
01:25:21,450 --> 01:25:25,590
we'll paste and we'll put 100 and then we'll paste and we'll do 10 again. 

1234
01:25:25,590 --> 01:25:30,720
And we can see that counting to 10, this is what it's come up with. Count to 20, 

1235
01:25:30,870 --> 01:25:35,70
it's done that for us, count to 20 and notice things are starting to get a little 

1236
01:25:35,70 --> 01:25:40,860
bit out of order. So it's basically, as the information comes in is when it's written 

1237
01:25:40,860 --> 01:25:41,610
to the stream. 

1238
01:25:41,610 --> 01:25:46,440
And what I notice about this, that is that it works very much similar to how Claude 

1239
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:50,580
Code would work, which is different to chat GPT, where you actually have to wait 

1240
01:25:50,580 --> 01:25:52,320
for each response to come through. 

1241
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:57,750
Now I don't personally know whether the way we've Claude code, if I was to rapid 

1242
01:25:57,750 --> 01:26:00,990
fire prompts like this, I kind of get aggregated 

1243
01:26:00,990 --> 01:26:05,760
you can put in an idea and then follow it up with a change of idea and it takes it 

1244
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:10,50
into account. I don't think that's happening here, but we've got the rudimentary 

1245
01:26:10,50 --> 01:26:13,740
ideas of what you can already do with Claude code or working.

1246
01:26:13,740 --> 01:26:19,350
Now let's get back to the workflow because I created a custom workflow to build all 

1247
01:26:19,350 --> 01:26:23,850
this out so that it could just run without too much input from me. And it's called 

1248
01:26:23,850 --> 01:26:29,220
the affidavit workflow. What it does is it starts off by asking a question, what 

1249
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:34,470
story do you want to have? So we did 2.3 At that point it started creating the story 

1250
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:39,630
and it did that by starting up the scrum master and running the draft story command. 

1251
01:26:39,630 --> 01:26:45,840
And as per normal, we got a detailed story written, it's in draft format at the moment, 

1252
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:49,650
and it's, as a developer, I want to stream responses 

1253
01:26:49,650 --> 01:26:54,180
so that the end users can see information progressively. Now we've seen that working, 

1254
01:26:54,180 --> 01:26:55,830
so we know it's all going on. 

1255
01:26:55,830 --> 01:27:00,420
It wrote the initial plan of what the code should look like in the story 

1256
01:27:00,420 --> 01:27:05,160
and then it gave me this status update so we can see that it's in draft 

1257
01:27:05,610 --> 01:27:10,320
acceptance criteria is there and it's got a couple of questions. Do I want to continue? 

1258
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:12,240
Do I wanna skip or exit? 

1259
01:27:12,240 --> 01:27:18,90
so we got a final summary of the creation of the story. We can see that it's in draft 

1260
01:27:18,90 --> 01:27:22,980
mode at the moment and it's asked me do I want to continue on to validation or skip. 

1261
01:27:23,220 --> 01:27:28,470
Now I said that the validation is optional, but I decided to just press continue 

1262
01:27:28,470 --> 01:27:34,110
and we can see that it's now going into to the product owner and validating the information 

1263
01:27:34,110 --> 01:27:35,980
in the story against other documents. 

1264
01:27:36,700 --> 01:27:42,280
Now we're onto story 2.4, which is all about reading the JSON document. And you can 

1265
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:47,440
see that I've done a basic test here. We can see the conversation, finding information 

1266
01:27:47,860 --> 01:27:51,430
on the computer. It's got three sample products in place. 

1267
01:27:51,430 --> 01:27:56,20
And if we jump down to the conversation, it started as usual with the new AppyDave 

1268
01:27:56,260 --> 01:28:00,70
of workflow. We've got 2.4 being the story that we want to run. 

1269
01:28:00,70 --> 01:28:03,430
It created that story and then I just typed in continue 

1270
01:28:03,430 --> 01:28:09,970
this, moved on to validating the file that gave a 9.5 out of 10. And the little issues 

1271
01:28:09,970 --> 01:28:13,750
that were there were all dealt with pretty cleanly during the development phase. 

1272
01:28:13,750 --> 01:28:15,40
So we didn't need to do anything. 

1273
01:28:15,40 --> 01:28:20,290
Once I then set the status to develop, we were able to come in and click on the developed 

1274
01:28:20,290 --> 01:28:20,920
story. 

1275
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:26,590
It also set up some sample data automatically. So we had some test products in place. 

1276
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:31,00
we also have broken data, which we haven't done a test case on just yet. 

1277
01:28:31,00 --> 01:28:36,730
Next, it built the story acceptance test based off the story and the code that we've 

1278
01:28:36,730 --> 01:28:42,340
developed. It also ran for me all the automated tests that it could do anything that 

1279
01:28:42,340 --> 01:28:46,210
was to do with the terminal or something that could be run from a command. 

1280
01:28:46,210 --> 01:28:47,860
Now during the SAT 

1281
01:28:47,860 --> 01:28:52,300
generation, it also generated a couple of files that were very unexpected. There 

1282
01:28:52,330 --> 01:28:55,330
was this human test, there was also a quick test 

1283
01:28:55,510 --> 01:29:01,30
So what I had to do was let it know that the SAT agent that we had created earlier 

1284
01:29:01,30 --> 01:29:06,730
in this project probably has some flaws and if it could go through and rectify them 

1285
01:29:06,910 --> 01:29:11,350
at the same time as cleaning up these files and putting them in the correct location. 

1286
01:29:11,350 --> 01:29:15,610
And this is the sort of bespoke issue that you can get from time to time. 

1287
01:29:15,610 --> 01:29:20,170
as soon as you see something out of the ordinary. With BMAD method, it's important 

1288
01:29:20,170 --> 01:29:22,330
that you probably fix it in the moment 

1289
01:29:22,330 --> 01:29:26,680
and let the system know either through learning documents or your claude.md or in 

1290
01:29:26,680 --> 01:29:31,570
this case an agent's file that it's not quite right, can it go and update itself? 

1291
01:29:32,50 --> 01:29:38,200
So we can see right here that the create SAT task has been updated with new instructions 

1292
01:29:38,620 --> 01:29:42,700
and the cleanup of unnecessary files has happened right here. 

1293
01:29:42,700 --> 01:29:48,190
now when I went to read the JSON using the AI agent, there were a couple of problems 

1294
01:29:48,190 --> 01:29:53,290
that needed to use the development agent to fix. The first one was a little permission 

1295
01:29:53,290 --> 01:29:58,240
issue. It rectified that really quickly based off documentation. Then there was the 

1296
01:29:58,240 --> 01:30:02,770
wrong folder. It got that fixed up as soon as I gave it an example of where I was 

1297
01:30:02,980 --> 01:30:07,420
trying to read and where the files actually were. And then lastly, which was the 

1298
01:30:07,420 --> 01:30:12,910
hardest one, was that we were implementing this concept of Read Jason, but it didn't 

1299
01:30:12,910 --> 01:30:18,10
have any ability to figure out what JSON documents were available or to discover 

1300
01:30:18,10 --> 01:30:19,240
the one you actually wanted. 

1301
01:30:19,240 --> 01:30:24,910
So it suggested and then quickly built two extra tools. The list would show any files 

1302
01:30:24,910 --> 01:30:25,870
that were available 

1303
01:30:26,20 --> 01:30:30,100
and the preview would let the agent interrogate the files to figure out which one 

1304
01:30:30,100 --> 01:30:31,30
you actually wanted.

1305
01:30:31,30 --> 01:30:36,590
So let's go and test the Raid system. We've got a little products document and we've 

1306
01:30:36,590 --> 01:30:42,30
also got a broken document. And we'll just head over to our site and we'll say, can 

1307
01:30:42,30 --> 01:30:46,670
you get me a list of products? We'll send that to the agent. It's processing at the 

1308
01:30:46,670 --> 01:30:47,350
moment.

1309
01:30:47,350 --> 01:30:51,630
I'll help you get a list of products first. Let's discover them. I've found some 

1310
01:30:51,630 --> 01:30:55,670
products. Let me read them. And it's got the file. And look at that. It's got the 

1311
01:30:55,710 --> 01:30:59,470
AppyDave on school. So it's got that file that we just updated.

1312
01:30:59,470 --> 01:31:04,390
And we'll see if this test against the broken JSON document will work, we'll say. 

1313
01:31:04,430 --> 01:31:09,870
Can you get a list of items from broken? And it's doing some processing at the moment. 

1314
01:31:09,870 --> 01:31:14,510
It's found that we have a broken JSON document. Let's read it.

1315
01:31:14,510 --> 01:31:19,990
And this is perfect. It's giving a nice message that the data is malformed and the 

1316
01:31:19,990 --> 01:31:21,750
system is not falling over.

1317
01:31:21,750 --> 01:31:27,570
just finished story 2.5, which is the ability to write information to the different 

1318
01:31:27,570 --> 01:31:30,300
data files. I've done a few use cases, 

1319
01:31:30,300 --> 01:31:35,470
but let's go through the individual changes that have happened. So from the appydave 

1320
01:31:35,790 --> 01:31:39,120
workflow point of view, there's a little bit of an improvement 

1321
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:44,340
because on load it has a look through to see what the last story was that was done 

1322
01:31:44,340 --> 01:31:48,780
and suggests the next story to go and write. So I've just put in 2.5 here. 

1323
01:31:48,780 --> 01:31:53,640
So it's created the story really quickly. But the challenge I had with the last story, 

1324
01:31:53,640 --> 01:31:57,240
was that we added a couple of new tools. That was the list, 

1325
01:31:57,240 --> 01:31:58,630
and the preview JSON. 

1326
01:31:58,890 --> 01:32:03,00
And so what I did at the time of validation, which is the next thing 

1327
01:32:03,30 --> 01:32:05,370
I then gave it some extra context 

1328
01:32:05,370 --> 01:32:07,350
by talking about the list and preview 

1329
01:32:07,350 --> 01:32:11,710
from the previous story and also giving it a little bit of a use case. 

1330
01:32:11,710 --> 01:32:17,230
So I was able to talk through the capabilities it could already see with adding Jason, 

1331
01:32:17,230 --> 01:32:22,210
but then it went on to document a bunch of critical gaps, which is exactly what we 

1332
01:32:22,210 --> 01:32:27,430
want. We want it to pick up old ideas, bring 'em into the new story and make it available 

1333
01:32:27,430 --> 01:32:28,390
for the development. 

1334
01:32:28,390 --> 01:32:33,130
So it gave me a bunch of options. I went with number one, that's just fix or update 

1335
01:32:33,130 --> 01:32:33,790
the story. 

1336
01:32:33,790 --> 01:32:37,210
So we're seeing new information being added to the story 

1337
01:32:37,210 --> 01:32:42,550
and that allowed us to go into developing with the new capabilities thought of along 

1338
01:32:42,550 --> 01:32:47,800
the way. And then when it wrote the SAT plan, one of the things that did automatically 

1339
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:53,230
this time, this because I'm gradually improving agents and workflows as we go, is 

1340
01:32:53,230 --> 01:32:56,710
that it did the automated tests of the terminal commands. 

1341
01:32:56,710 --> 01:33:01,930
But I did ask it to run up more one more time and just give me a summary of what's 

1342
01:33:01,930 --> 01:33:06,460
going on. So we can see the eight tests that are from the terminal are all working. 

1343
01:33:06,460 --> 01:33:11,50
And then it started listing eight different tests that I as the human could go and 

1344
01:33:11,50 --> 01:33:15,490
test and the steps to work on 'em. Now, the first one actually failed 

1345
01:33:15,490 --> 01:33:21,220
and the failure was simply that it wrote the Jason document out in quote mark, so 

1346
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:24,760
as a string. So I let it know that there was an issue there, 

1347
01:33:24,760 --> 01:33:28,60
quickly found and rectified that particular problem. 

1348
01:33:28,60 --> 01:33:32,590
Then I ran into a new problem, which didn't end up being a bug, but just a gap in 

1349
01:33:32,590 --> 01:33:37,360
the requirements. And you can see the basic idea here is that I had a conversation 

1350
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:43,150
that said Add sugar for 50 cents. Now, I said that statement after a prior statement 

1351
01:33:43,210 --> 01:33:47,950
of looking in the products table. So I assume contextually it would just work. 

1352
01:33:47,950 --> 01:33:51,190
And the issue is that it had no conversational memory 

1353
01:33:51,190 --> 01:33:54,220
each time it went back to the SDK, 

1354
01:33:54,220 --> 01:33:59,620
So it suggested we could either fix it or create a new story. So what I've done is 

1355
01:33:59,650 --> 01:34:02,140
added a new story to this epic called 2.7 

1356
01:34:02,990 --> 01:34:05,540
just based directly off the information right here. 

1357
01:34:05,540 --> 01:34:09,750
so the ability to have conversational memory is something we'll do in two stories 

1358
01:34:09,750 --> 01:34:10,80
time.

1359
01:34:10,80 --> 01:34:15,270
So let's test the idea of adding and updating files in the data folder. We've gotta 

1360
01:34:15,270 --> 01:34:19,260
test products. We can see the information that's here. We've got one broken file 

1361
01:34:19,260 --> 01:34:19,740
as well. 

1362
01:34:19,740 --> 01:34:24,360
And we'll come over and say, can you add a product? We want sugar and we want it 

1363
01:34:24,360 --> 01:34:25,380
to be 50 cents. 

1364
01:34:25,380 --> 01:34:30,750
After that, we'll just go down to our use cases and we've got this create an electronics 

1365
01:34:30,750 --> 01:34:35,250
js document under the catalog folder. So it'll be a nested file 

1366
01:34:35,250 --> 01:34:38,190
and it's saying it will do it with a laptop and a phone. 

1367
01:34:38,190 --> 01:34:43,770
Now we'll head down to our Jason document. We can see that this is expanded to have 

1368
01:34:43,770 --> 01:34:48,660
sugar at 50 cents. Looks like we've got our new file. Let's just drag that in. We've 

1369
01:34:48,660 --> 01:34:53,970
got an electronics catalog and we've got multiple items coming in here and they're 

1370
01:34:53,970 --> 01:34:55,20
quite detailed. 

1371
01:34:55,20 --> 01:35:00,390
Now let's try out a couple of discovery commands. So we'll go what Jason exists 

1372
01:35:00,390 --> 01:35:03,120
in the data directory. Let's see what comes through. 

1373
01:35:03,120 --> 01:35:07,410
We can see the broken and the test products. We don't have the catalog so it hasn't 

1374
01:35:07,410 --> 01:35:08,310
looked deeply, 

1375
01:35:08,310 --> 01:35:13,380
but what we'll do is we'll add a category field to the test products table. 

1376
01:35:13,380 --> 01:35:15,330
So click that center agent. 

1377
01:35:15,330 --> 01:35:19,20
It's telling us it'll add a category, now it's done it, 

1378
01:35:19,20 --> 01:35:24,90
and if we head over to VS code, we can now see that on products. We've got these 

1379
01:35:24,120 --> 01:35:26,520
categories. So we've got groceries over here. 

1380
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:31,260
And there was a couple of other interesting use cases that all worked, which I didn't 

1381
01:35:31,260 --> 01:35:36,420
even think of. It just created these and the ability to create a file outside of 

1382
01:35:36,420 --> 01:35:38,490
the data directory was blocked. 

1383
01:35:38,490 --> 01:35:40,920
Creating a file with circular references. 

1384
01:35:40,920 --> 01:35:47,940
And the last useful example is to just add five items, an array to a new table. 

1385
01:35:47,940 --> 01:35:50,460
So here we have five sites added. 

1386
01:35:50,460 --> 01:35:55,680
So what we're seeing now is this really powerful mechanism where we can read, we 

1387
01:35:55,680 --> 01:35:57,270
can write, we can update, 

1388
01:35:57,270 --> 01:36:02,140
we can work with sub directories of files back on our server. Now these are data 

1389
01:36:02,140 --> 01:36:07,690
files. Next we'll be looking at how we can do HTML files. But the whole idea of this 

1390
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:11,830
is more for an internal tool. I wouldn't, it's not the sort of tool that we would 

1391
01:36:11,830 --> 01:36:16,150
use up on a public website where it can write to your server. But if you're trying 

1392
01:36:16,150 --> 01:36:20,830
to build a little application for yourself and you want the ability to dynamically 

1393
01:36:20,860 --> 01:36:25,240
update data just by talking into the microphone, then this is a perfect technique 

1394
01:36:25,240 --> 01:36:26,170
that we can be using.

1395
01:36:26,170 --> 01:36:32,770
Now is star 2.6. Our conversational bot is now starting to get really powerful. So 

1396
01:36:32,810 --> 01:36:37,850
what we'll do is we'll start off with a simple question. And that's what HTML files 

1397
01:36:37,850 --> 01:36:39,970
exist in the public directory. 

1398
01:36:40,130 --> 01:36:45,130
And you can see here it's saying that there are currently no HTML files in the public 

1399
01:36:45,130 --> 01:36:50,890
directory. And if we head down to VS code we can confirm that. So we've got our data 

1400
01:36:50,890 --> 01:36:55,810
directory from the last session available. But in the server when we click on public 

1401
01:36:55,810 --> 01:36:57,290
there's nothing there right now.

1402
01:36:57,290 --> 01:37:01,70
So the full conversation for this workflow was that we started with the AppyDave 

1403
01:37:01,160 --> 01:37:06,560
workflow. It figured out that it had done 2.5 and that it could move on to 2.6, 

1404
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:12,110
and so it was able to start up the scrum master and create the story for us. Now, 

1405
01:37:12,110 --> 01:37:19,460
because we'd made a lot of extensions within the 2.4 and the 2.5 story, I decided 

1406
01:37:19,460 --> 01:37:24,500
to let it know that it was modeling these two stories, except rather than for data 

1407
01:37:24,500 --> 01:37:26,360
it was going to be for HTML. 

1408
01:37:26,360 --> 01:37:31,280
And so while there were major differences, like the type of file and the location 

1409
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:35,150
that they were going to be, the actual tooling was pretty much the same. 

1410
01:37:35,150 --> 01:37:39,470
And so I suggested that it have a look at the 2.4 and the 2.5 

1411
01:37:39,560 --> 01:37:42,860
before updating this story with new capability. 

1412
01:37:42,860 --> 01:37:46,820
From that, it was able to notice all the critical gaps that were in place 

1413
01:37:46,820 --> 01:37:51,230
and come up with four separate tools to implement. Before that, it had only had one 

1414
01:37:51,380 --> 01:37:53,450
tool, which was writing the HTML. 

1415
01:37:53,450 --> 01:37:59,210
Now to show that this was an extensive change, we can see as we scroll through that 

1416
01:37:59,210 --> 01:38:03,170
there's a lot of green and reds, a lot of stuff being taken out, a lot of new stuff 

1417
01:38:03,170 --> 01:38:03,980
being added, 

1418
01:38:04,280 --> 01:38:10,190
and the public directory is the 2.6 story. So then we changed over to the development 

1419
01:38:10,190 --> 01:38:13,130
agent. Everything pretty much went off without a hitch 

1420
01:38:13,130 --> 01:38:17,150
There were two different problems that I did need to address and you can see them 

1421
01:38:17,150 --> 01:38:21,830
here. The first one was that it wasn't actually serving from the public directory. 

1422
01:38:21,980 --> 01:38:26,30
I was able to test all the HTML, but not from the application. So that was a bit 

1423
01:38:26,30 --> 01:38:26,570
of a problem. 

1424
01:38:26,570 --> 01:38:30,650
the other problem was that when I was trying to display data that we created in the 

1425
01:38:30,650 --> 01:38:33,590
previous story, it, it also wasn't showing through. 

1426
01:38:33,590 --> 01:38:37,370
so it did a little bit of prompt engineering just to get the code working. It was 

1427
01:38:37,370 --> 01:38:38,570
really easy to do 

1428
01:38:38,570 --> 01:38:43,670
because Claude Code gave me option A, B, and C, and I just said, let's go with A 

1429
01:38:43,670 --> 01:38:46,520
and C, and it just wrote all the code that we needed, 

1430
01:38:46,520 --> 01:38:51,590
So with our chat agent set up to story 2.6, we'll just put in a simple prompt that 

1431
01:38:51,590 --> 01:38:55,760
says, can you createa HTML page for AppyDave? 

1432
01:38:55,760 --> 01:39:00,140
And along with that question, I'll just paste in a little bit of information I just 

1433
01:39:00,140 --> 01:39:04,430
copied from my website and we'll press enter and see what it does with that. 

1434
01:39:04,430 --> 01:39:08,420
Now you'll notice as it's building it that we've got this concept down the bottom 

1435
01:39:08,420 --> 01:39:13,730
of pages. So I've also added a little menu to the bottom of the chat box to show 

1436
01:39:13,970 --> 01:39:16,40
any public pages that are being created. 

1437
01:39:16,40 --> 01:39:18,320
So it's just come back with, I'll create 

1438
01:39:18,320 --> 01:39:23,660
page. Let me check. I'll create it. And it looks like a bunch of stuff's being created 

1439
01:39:23,660 --> 01:39:27,980
and we can see this little index. Let's click on that and see what we get. We've 

1440
01:39:27,980 --> 01:39:33,170
got AppyDave, and this is actually a whole lot of information from my main website. 

1441
01:39:33,170 --> 01:39:37,250
We'll just pop over and have a look at that. And we can see Master AI and prompt 

1442
01:39:37,250 --> 01:39:41,630
engineering different projects and down the bottom different channels. So if we come 

1443
01:39:41,630 --> 01:39:45,620
through and look at it here, it looks like it's all the same information. 

1444
01:39:45,620 --> 01:39:50,900
all it's done is created this little HTML file for us, and it's put all the colors 

1445
01:39:51,110 --> 01:39:51,530
in there. 

1446
01:39:51,530 --> 01:39:55,580
Let's see if we can do something a little bit more complex. And we'll do a prompt 

1447
01:39:55,580 --> 01:40:03,110
that says, can you create a HTML page called Cat dash Dog and do it talking about 

1448
01:40:03,110 --> 01:40:08,900
a pet store that is about cats and dogs. And let's go with the colors of brown, yellow, 

1449
01:40:08,900 --> 01:40:09,740
and green. 

1450
01:40:09,740 --> 01:40:13,400
So we'll just let this prompt come through as soon as it's typed in.

1451
01:40:13,400 --> 01:40:16,200
So we'll send that through to the agent.

1452
01:40:16,200 --> 01:40:22,00
And we can see all our product data down here. We can see our cat dog and our HTML 

1453
01:40:22,00 --> 01:40:22,320
file.

1454
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:28,410
So what I think I wanna do now is create a new HTML file. We'll go with a CSS file 

1455
01:40:28,470 --> 01:40:29,280
as well 

1456
01:40:29,580 --> 01:40:31,260
So the prompt will go, 

1457
01:40:31,260 --> 01:40:35,820
can you create a HTML file called a AI-TLDR 

1458
01:40:36,750 --> 01:40:40,770
And can we create a cs s file to go with that? 

1459
01:40:40,770 --> 01:40:47,820
can the colors of that CSS be light blue, dark blue and white? And can we make sure 

1460
01:40:47,820 --> 01:40:52,620
that we're displaying a whole lot of products? Can the products come from our test 

1461
01:40:52,710 --> 01:40:53,310
products 

1462
01:40:53,310 --> 01:40:53,940
document? 

1463
01:40:53,940 --> 01:40:59,190
So I'll just let that prompt come through. There it is. And we'll press enter. So 

1464
01:40:59,250 --> 01:41:00,930
there's a couple of typos in there, 

1465
01:41:00,930 --> 01:41:05,130
but it looks like we're going to create A HTML file matching CSS file. 

1466
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:08,520
Perfect. Now let me check what pages exist 

1467
01:41:08,520 --> 01:41:13,890
and while that's happening, what AI TLDR is is one of my other channels. This is 

1468
01:41:13,890 --> 01:41:18,270
a faceless YouTube channel where most of the focus is on 

1469
01:41:18,270 --> 01:41:19,560
YouTube storytelling. 

1470
01:41:19,560 --> 01:41:23,670
so we've got something coming through. They're not necessarily the colors we normally 

1471
01:41:23,670 --> 01:41:29,430
use, but let's go and click on this and see what we get. A-I-T-L-D-R product catalog. 

1472
01:41:29,430 --> 01:41:34,680
And this is really interesting from a few points of view. So the actual widgets that 

1473
01:41:34,680 --> 01:41:39,540
are in the product listing, aby school sugar, this has all come through, but we've 

1474
01:41:39,540 --> 01:41:44,400
even got the HTML links so we can get to the homepage. Can we get to 

1475
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:45,240
the cat and dog? 

1476
01:41:45,540 --> 01:41:49,770
We can get to the cat and dog. What about products that's taking us to where we are 

1477
01:41:49,770 --> 01:41:51,540
And if we go back to the chat interface, 

1478
01:41:51,630 --> 01:41:55,980
So at this point, we've almost achieved everything I wanted with this project. It 

1479
01:41:55,980 --> 01:42:00,840
was the ability to create any sort of data we want. Let's go and test the idea of 

1480
01:42:00,930 --> 01:42:01,950
updating data. 

1481
01:42:01,950 --> 01:42:08,340
Can you go and add three different products about nail polish? Let that come through 

1482
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:13,860
and send that to the agent. And what I'm hoping it'll do is it'll come up with three 

1483
01:42:13,860 --> 01:42:18,480
interesting products. It should be able to add it to the only file we've got, which 

1484
01:42:18,480 --> 01:42:19,260
is the test 

1485
01:42:19,260 --> 01:42:19,830
products. 

1486
01:42:19,830 --> 01:42:23,730
probably should go and rename that. Well, let's just go back to this. 

1487
01:42:23,730 --> 01:42:28,500
It can see the file. It's now apparently added things. Oh, look at that. It's showing 

1488
01:42:28,500 --> 01:42:33,870
them as well. So we'll go and click on the AI TLDR page and see what that's showing. 

1489
01:42:33,870 --> 01:42:35,580
Okay, we've got five products. 

1490
01:42:35,580 --> 01:42:40,980
Now our page hasn't updated, but if I go down to Visual Studio, we can see that three 

1491
01:42:41,40 --> 01:42:47,880
actual products have been added. So my assumption is it's not reading from the JavaScript 

1492
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:51,900
and it's not, it's actually been hard coded. So maybe we can modify that. 

1493
01:42:51,900 --> 01:42:58,210
So we're going to work with the idea of can we update the HTML of AI-TLDR so that 

1494
01:42:58,210 --> 01:43:03,520
the products are actually just reading from that URL. So we'll send that through. 

1495
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:08,530
While that's doing its theme, we can have a look at the URL. This is the data that's 

1496
01:43:08,530 --> 01:43:09,730
available to us. 

1497
01:43:09,730 --> 01:43:14,530
It says that the page is working. Let's go and click on it and look at that. We've 

1498
01:43:14,530 --> 01:43:19,300
got eight products, we've got three new products added. So yeah, we're using our 

1499
01:43:19,300 --> 01:43:21,340
chat interface to both, 

1500
01:43:21,340 --> 01:43:27,250
create data, update data, delete it, or we dunno whether it can delete and to actually 

1501
01:43:27,250 --> 01:43:31,510
modify the HTML. So let's see if we can do one more compound idea. 

1502
01:43:31,510 --> 01:43:36,590
So we'll go with the idea of can it delete widgets from the test products

1503
01:43:36,590 --> 01:43:43,430
table, the JSON document, can we also go to the AI-TLDR CSS and we'll start changing 

1504
01:43:43,430 --> 01:43:48,950
the colors to be a light pink, blue and yellow. We'll send that through to the agent. 

1505
01:43:48,990 --> 01:43:54,270
We should see it coming down the bottom here. So currently it's doing a search broadly 

1506
01:43:54,270 --> 01:43:59,510
for the CSS files. It's found them. It's now going to read the full content from 

1507
01:43:59,510 --> 01:43:59,790
them.

1508
01:43:59,790 --> 01:44:04,790
It's found widget A, B and C which it's going to remove from the JSON. Then it's 

1509
01:44:04,790 --> 01:44:09,230
going to go and update the CSS. And it looks like it's done that.

1510
01:44:09,230 --> 01:44:13,670
And what we'll do is click on AI-TLDR and look at that. 

1511
01:44:13,670 --> 01:44:18,590
we got pinks blues and yellows. And we've removed the three widgets.

1512
01:44:19,580 --> 01:44:25,400
Moving on to story 2.7, which is a new story that came about 'cause we encountered 

1513
01:44:25,400 --> 01:44:30,710
a bug where if you typed in a couple of messages it didn't understand the previous 

1514
01:44:30,710 --> 01:44:36,140
messages. So we've put it in place and what I thought we'd do is test it by maybe 

1515
01:44:36,140 --> 01:44:42,50
changing the title of this particular website and at the same time also change the 

1516
01:44:42,50 --> 01:44:45,950
price of just cats. And we'll do that in two separate messages. 

1517
01:44:46,100 --> 01:44:47,630
So here's our first prompt. 

1518
01:44:47,630 --> 01:44:53,00
Can you change the title of the cat dog website so that rather than saying cat and 

1519
01:44:53,00 --> 01:44:55,850
Dog Pet store, it just says Pet store. 

1520
01:44:55,850 --> 01:44:59,480
So we'll kick that off and then we'll start the next prompt. 

1521
01:44:59,480 --> 01:45:04,460
Can you go to the Cat Dog website and change every product 

1522
01:45:04,460 --> 01:45:08,690
that is related to a cat so that it is $100 more? 

1523
01:45:08,690 --> 01:45:13,940
And we'll just press enter on that one. Now, if we look at the current website, it 

1524
01:45:13,940 --> 01:45:18,170
says Cat and Dog Pet Store. Now I've done a refresh on it and we can see that the 

1525
01:45:18,170 --> 01:45:20,390
pet store has been updated. 

1526
01:45:20,570 --> 01:45:24,260
we wanna see ifthe 24.99 becomes 124.99. 

1527
01:45:25,70 --> 01:45:31,70
And they have changed. So there's the new value and we've got the old value as 24 99 

1528
01:45:31,70 --> 01:45:32,390
and Cat and Dog Pet store. 

1529
01:45:32,390 --> 01:45:37,370
So from a conversational point of view, it was pretty much the standard workflow. 

1530
01:45:37,370 --> 01:45:43,520
We started off with the appydave-workflow. We created the 2.7 story, we validated 

1531
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:43,700
it. 

1532
01:45:43,700 --> 01:45:48,920
The minor change here was that I asked it to go and read the documentation around 

1533
01:45:48,920 --> 01:45:49,790
the SDK. 

1534
01:45:49,790 --> 01:45:53,960
And we have a second brain of information around that particular tool. 

1535
01:45:54,290 --> 01:45:58,910
the basic findings from that were all listed and updated the story. 

1536
01:45:58,910 --> 01:46:03,890
We then just did our standard development phase. We did an SAT. There was nothing 

1537
01:46:03,890 --> 01:46:06,590
in there other than to run the two commands that I did. 

1538
01:46:06,590 --> 01:46:11,60
And so we just finish off with a review from the QA agent 

1539
01:46:11,60 --> 01:46:17,150
So that brings us to the end of Epic two, and what we can now do is we can add products 

1540
01:46:17,150 --> 01:46:21,620
or any sort of data that we like. We can update it. We can also play around with 

1541
01:46:21,620 --> 01:46:23,960
HTML, CSS or JavaScript 

1542
01:46:23,960 --> 01:46:28,550
and we could call this a complete application, but if we look at what Epic Number 

1543
01:46:28,550 --> 01:46:30,110
three is going to be about, 

1544
01:46:30,110 --> 01:46:34,790
we'll be able to give the chat interface a much needed upgrade 

1545
01:46:34,790 --> 01:46:40,760
and we'll do that by going to React where we'll use VI Shad cn, tailwind CSS, and 

1546
01:46:40,760 --> 01:46:46,610
we'll use the Vercel AI elements to give a really clean chat interface. 

1547
01:46:46,610 --> 01:46:51,830
Now it's a fairly simple epic, we're going to initialize the React application, then 

1548
01:46:51,830 --> 01:46:58,190
we're going to install the Shad CN and configure Tailwind CSS. Then we'll build the 

1549
01:46:58,280 --> 01:47:03,890
chat interface again using Vercel AI elements. And lastly, we'll implement a simple 

1550
01:47:03,890 --> 01:47:05,750
dark mode, light mode toggle.

1551
01:47:05,750 --> 01:47:10,970
So one of the things that we have to do before we actually start the first story 

1552
01:47:10,970 --> 01:47:16,190
for Epic number three is we just need to do a little bit of a retrospective. So I've 

1553
01:47:16,190 --> 01:47:22,160
got a basic question just asking it to think about what it would need to do a retrospective, 

1554
01:47:22,160 --> 01:47:27,410
and it's come up with a long list of tasks that it should perform to build up that 

1555
01:47:27,410 --> 01:47:28,400
particular document. 

1556
01:47:28,400 --> 01:47:33,800
I've specifically told it to think deeply, and I've also given it as much time as 

1557
01:47:33,800 --> 01:47:39,320
it needs to do a detailed job. And so it goes through and it writes this long document 

1558
01:47:39,320 --> 01:47:41,780
and we don't have to read the document, but 

1559
01:47:41,840 --> 01:47:46,220
It will have information from here that it can pull on when generating the stories 

1560
01:47:46,220 --> 01:47:47,90
for Epic three.

1561
01:47:47,90 --> 01:47:53,290
So story 3.1 is finished. There's not actually a lot to see. There's a little bit 

1562
01:47:53,290 --> 01:47:59,250
of console logging. We can see now that it's using React and Vite. And from a front 

1563
01:47:59,250 --> 01:48:04,530
end point of view, all we've got is hello world, be mad Claude SDK and the fact that 

1564
01:48:04,530 --> 01:48:06,170
it says vite connected.

1565
01:48:06,170 --> 01:48:11,970
and we'll just check that the hot module reloading is working. That's working. Okay.

1566
01:48:11,970 --> 01:48:17,650
So we have a foundation now for the react version of the chat client. 

1567
01:48:17,650 --> 01:48:19,730
Let's move on to story 3.2.

1568
01:48:19,730 --> 01:48:26,130
Now we are on story 3.2 and there's not a lot to be seen just yet. We've got an installation 

1569
01:48:26,130 --> 01:48:33,90
of Shadchan and UI, and if we pop it up, what we'll see is this user interface with 

1570
01:48:33,130 --> 01:48:37,730
the basic typing area in place. We've got to click me and we've got some buttons. 

1571
01:48:37,730 --> 01:48:40,370
And the styling is very ordinary at the moment.

1572
01:48:40,370 --> 01:48:45,770
And according to the component verification, that's exactly what we want to see at 

1573
01:48:45,770 --> 01:48:46,130
the moment.

1574
01:48:46,130 --> 01:48:52,130
We've just completed story 3.3, and we're really close to the end of building the 

1575
01:48:52,130 --> 01:48:57,730
application. And what you can see now is that it started to come together quite nicely. 

1576
01:48:57,770 --> 01:49:02,250
We'll demonstrate where it's at in a moment, but I'll point out that this is the 

1577
01:49:02,250 --> 01:49:08,690
14th story that we've done, and every story we've done up until this one just came 

1578
01:49:08,690 --> 01:49:13,650
across without a hitch. It was able to be created. It was validated. 

1579
01:49:13,650 --> 01:49:17,130
It was written by the software developer. We were able to do 

1580
01:49:17,130 --> 01:49:21,930
the story acceptance testing, and we were able to do the QA afterwards. And everything 

1581
01:49:21,930 --> 01:49:27,370
was really quite quick. This is the one story where everything changed. So I'll do 

1582
01:49:27,370 --> 01:49:31,970
a little bit of a postmortem analysis of it as well, after I've demonstrated where 

1583
01:49:31,970 --> 01:49:32,530
we're at.

1584
01:49:32,530 --> 01:49:37,750
So let's test out our new chat bot. And what we'll do is we'll search for products 

1585
01:49:37,750 --> 01:49:43,420
first. So can you tell me what products are available? And we'll let this prompt 

1586
01:49:43,420 --> 01:49:48,760
come through. We'll press enter. And so we can see this little bubble coming up here. 

1587
01:49:48,790 --> 01:49:54,730
That's what the user has said. This is what the agent SDK is responding with at the 

1588
01:49:54,730 --> 01:50:00,190
moment. And there are our products. We've got some groceries, we've got some beauty 

1589
01:50:00,190 --> 01:50:04,810
products, nail art sort of stuff. So let's create a little website. 

1590
01:50:04,810 --> 01:50:11,230
Can you create a little HTML website called Beauty and Joy? Can this be a nail art 

1591
01:50:11,350 --> 01:50:17,230
sort of store? Can we get both a HTML page and a CSS file? 

1592
01:50:17,230 --> 01:50:23,140
And we'll let that kick off. And in a moment it'll come up with a plan of action. 

1593
01:50:23,320 --> 01:50:28,600
And here it's starting to happen. And what we can also do is just head over to VS 

1594
01:50:28,600 --> 01:50:33,280
code where we can see what we currently have. We have a couple of websites here, 

1595
01:50:33,280 --> 01:50:40,720
cat Dog Index and AI-AITLDR. And if we come back and we look at these little pages 

1596
01:50:40,720 --> 01:50:45,880
here, this is where we can see this and look at that. It just created beauty and 

1597
01:50:45,880 --> 01:50:50,80
joy. So maybe that's already started. Let's go back and see whether it's created 

1598
01:50:50,80 --> 01:50:56,140
here. Yes, we can see it. We've got a CSS file and a HTML file, and that's why that 

1599
01:50:56,140 --> 01:51:02,170
came about. So let's go and click on that and see what we get. Okay, we've got a 

1600
01:51:02,200 --> 01:51:03,610
interesting looking 

1601
01:51:03,610 --> 01:51:09,400
nail art shop. I think we can do better styling than that. So what I'll do is I'll 

1602
01:51:09,400 --> 01:51:17,80
bring it back here and say, can you update the CSS styling for the Beauty and Joy 

1603
01:51:17,110 --> 01:51:23,290
website? And can you use this basic guidelines? So what we'll do is we'll just go 

1604
01:51:23,290 --> 01:51:29,260
down and paste some extra work and hopefully this will show up plainly. Here we go. 

1605
01:51:29,260 --> 01:51:34,420
We've got soft, modern, feminine. We got some primary colors coming through 

1606
01:51:34,420 --> 01:51:37,810
and it should be updating the CSS very soon. 

1607
01:51:37,810 --> 01:51:43,600
And it looks like it's finished. It's actually created a different HTML. So if we 

1608
01:51:43,600 --> 01:51:48,370
go up, we now have two. We have beauty and joy. And we have beauty. Let's look at 

1609
01:51:48,370 --> 01:51:54,400
the old one. Here's the old one. And the new one is looking a fair bit more elegant. 

1610
01:51:54,400 --> 01:51:59,230
Now, ideally, I would've liked that to actually update the original website, but 

1611
01:51:59,350 --> 01:52:06,340
for a first pass at a chat bot that can create data, read data, and also use it for 

1612
01:52:06,340 --> 01:52:07,60
websites. 

1613
01:52:07,90 --> 01:52:08,650
This is working really well.

1614
01:52:08,650 --> 01:52:14,530
Now I said that this story wasn't actually as successful in the coding as any other 

1615
01:52:14,530 --> 01:52:18,490
story that we've done, but let's have a look at what it was originally. It's build 

1616
01:52:18,490 --> 01:52:24,760
a chat interface with Sal AI as a developer, a chat interface using the AI element 

1617
01:52:24,790 --> 01:52:30,670
patterns so that users can send messages and have streaming agent responses. Now 

1618
01:52:30,670 --> 01:52:33,70
that's working and so pretty happy with that. 

1619
01:52:33,70 --> 01:52:39,160
but let's have a look at the post mortem. And this is where a number of issues happened. 

1620
01:52:39,160 --> 01:52:42,940
Now, part of the issues happened because I think when I was doing it, I was really 

1621
01:52:42,940 --> 01:52:44,830
tired, so I wasn't paying attention, 

1622
01:52:44,830 --> 01:52:49,810
to different things going on. But the main issue, which I seem to run into every 

1623
01:52:49,810 --> 01:52:53,830
time I do tailwind and totally forgot about it in this particular case, 

1624
01:52:53,830 --> 01:52:59,410
is that it got configured with V3 syntax, but it was a V4 Tailwind. 

1625
01:52:59,410 --> 01:53:03,460
and you might've noticed in the last story that there was styling that looked pretty 

1626
01:53:03,460 --> 01:53:07,270
average. And I said, well, that's actually how it's meant to be. Well, that's not 

1627
01:53:07,270 --> 01:53:12,400
the case. And the reason is that the tailwind styling was misconfigured and it took 

1628
01:53:12,400 --> 01:53:17,80
a little while to find it out. Another issue that was happening under the hood for 

1629
01:53:17,80 --> 01:53:20,560
me is that one of the servers there, there are two in this, 

1630
01:53:20,560 --> 01:53:26,830
was meant to be running on 5173, but Claude was actually running a separate one on 

1631
01:53:27,10 --> 01:53:32,650
5174. And so I was trying to see updates and nothing was coming through, and I kept 

1632
01:53:32,650 --> 01:53:37,210
saying to Claude, this is not working. And he kept saying, I've fixed it, but I wasn't 

1633
01:53:37,210 --> 01:53:41,140
seeing anything visually. Now, again, a lot of that was me tied at the time, 

1634
01:53:41,140 --> 01:53:46,360
but this is one of the realities of having AI agents that can run the servers for 

1635
01:53:46,360 --> 01:53:50,770
you is that if they've got a conflict with your current server, then it's just going 

1636
01:53:50,770 --> 01:53:53,470
to spawn a new one on a different port. 

1637
01:53:53,470 --> 01:53:59,530
Then it had a bunch of issues with the bubbles and the dropdown menu that we saw 

1638
01:53:59,740 --> 01:54:02,50
go showing up underneath the bubbles. 

1639
01:54:02,50 --> 01:54:07,60
Now, the reason I actually wrote this document wasn't just so that I could show you 

1640
01:54:07,60 --> 01:54:11,260
the sort of challenges that you can run into, but because once you write a document 

1641
01:54:11,260 --> 01:54:16,660
like this, you can make it a part of your documentation system. So if any other issues 

1642
01:54:16,660 --> 01:54:21,490
happen in the future and you notice it, you can say, can you go and read other documentation 

1643
01:54:21,490 --> 01:54:23,560
or lessons learnt that, 

1644
01:54:23,560 --> 01:54:24,670
we've done in the past? 

1645
01:54:24,670 --> 01:54:30,550
and this can be a perfect way of training the AI model to you to write code the right 

1646
01:54:30,580 --> 01:54:34,450
way if you see a certain problem showing up again and again.
