00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:05,600
I'm AppyDave, and in this video we're looking at a talk that I gave last night for 

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:11,480
Ecamm Live Tech Summit on multi-agent workflows. And specifically, we're looking 

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:16,80
at a framework that I've been putting together called Emotional Support Spiders.

4
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:20,760
In this video, we'll be covering the prompt engineering the AI workflows and agents, 

5
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:26,40
and also talking about how I'm putting together a system for multiple character, 

6
00:00:26,40 --> 00:00:29,720
multiple storylines with videography to fit. 

7
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:36,660
So if you're currently a YouTuber or a storyteller online and you're using AI at 

8
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:42,540
the moment, you might be concerned about whether in the future AI is going to get 

9
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:47,540
rid of you from the picture, or is it something that's going to give you superpowers 

10
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:53,740
over time? So in this video, we're looking at different aspects of storytelling and 

11
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:59,500
visualization with AI. For instance, in the next five years, it's predicted that 

12
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:07,140
90% of all content online will be AI generated one way or another. So here I'm talking 

13
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:13,740
about the AI workflows that I use, and what I'm suggesting might be good for creators. 

14
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,740
And I do it through what I call the scale framework.

15
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:22,750
So let's power up, get on our superpowers and have a look at what we can do Today 

16
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,600
with video content generation and movies 

17
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:28,860
are forged in the fires of the YouTube battlefield. 

18
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:33,880
Only the strongest, the most persistent, the most clickbait driven warriors 

19
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:35,270
will survive 

20
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:38,580
in the kingdom of contempt, views our power 

21
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:44,680
and the shows. No Mercy AppyDave was once just a creator, but when the prophecy called 

22
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:53,50
for 555 videos in 55 weeks across five channels, he answered, he has climbed the 

23
00:01:53,50 --> 00:01:58,150
treacherous mountain of mastery where many have fallen. He has battled burnout, 

24
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:03,410
braved the shadow band swamps, and faced the dreaded demonetization dungeon. 

25
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:08,520
He has studied the sacred texts, viral thumbnails, retention graphs in every cat 

26
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:16,230
video in search of the ultimate truth. Is he a genius, a madman, a man haunted by 

27
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:19,740
the ghosts of unfinished edits? No one knows, 

28
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,940
but one thing certain he won't stop 

29
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:31,420
until he finds the answer or loses his mind. Trying. This is the ridiculous legend 

30
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:35,320
of AppyDave and the 5 5 5 Manifesto. 

31
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:42,240
So that was AppyDave, the 5 5 5 Manifesto, which is a Hollywood style blockbuster 

32
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:48,420
video trailer that I put together a couple of months ago for a different tech summit. 

33
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:53,430
And what I wanna do is talk about how I'm putting these together across multiple 

34
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,300
channels.

35
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:59,660
So let's look at one of the fundamental ideas that are needed to succeed on YouTube. 

36
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:05,100
And this comes from MrBeast. When asked the question why after I've done ten videos, 

37
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:10,140
am I not seeing any subscribers or views? And he says that unless you've done 100 

38
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:14,940
videos and looked at how to improve on each and every video, don't bother wasting 

39
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:21,460
his time. And what I did a couple of years ago was to think, can I do that 100 videos? 

40
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,980
But can I do it across five different channels?

41
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:29,620
So for some time now, I've been using this metaphor called the Mountain of Mastery, 

42
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:34,120
which is a spiral learning metaphor that says that as you go around the mountain, 

43
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:39,460
at each stage you can see something different. But as you go around the mountain 

44
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:43,900
a couple of times and you look at a higher level, you have more clarity around what 

45
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:48,760
it is you're seeing. And I find this happens to be the case across concepts like 

46
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:54,520
YouTube titles, how to write descriptions, how to do hooks, how to do outros. As 

47
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:59,230
I go through the mountain of mastery, over time I learn a little bit more. 

48
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:04,700
and what I wanted to do with that knowledge is encapsulate it into AI agents for 

49
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:10,100
YouTube automation. And that's where the 5 5 5 Manifesto started a couple of years 

50
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:17,840
ago in a conversation with ChatGPT, where I said, can I create 555 videos in 55 weeks 

51
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:23,90
across five different channels? And looking to do that using automation systems.

52
00:04:23,90 --> 00:04:29,150
Now to start achieving that, I had to put in place a new system of thinking and automation, 

53
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:33,950
and I call that the scale framework. And the idea of the scale framework is that 

54
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:38,870
we start from the point of view of structured prompt engineering. The ability to 

55
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:44,30
communicate with AI is one of the fundamental skills that we need. The way we're 

56
00:04:44,30 --> 00:04:46,70
using large language models today.

57
00:04:46,90 --> 00:04:50,950
Once you understand how to do the prompt engineering, you can move into prompt chains 

58
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:57,390
or crafting different workflows or standard operating procedures that automate certain 

59
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:03,350
parts of your business or your YouTube content creation. After that, I like to package 

60
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:08,390
it all up in agents. Now, these agents might be pure automations, or they might be 

61
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:11,190
automations with human in the loop concepts. 

62
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:15,680
After that we want to hook into low code tools. So let's say you've done a video, 

63
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:20,920
you've generated an article based off the video. You then want to be able to push 

64
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:26,40
that directly into your WordPress site. Or you might want to upload assets to Canva. 

65
00:05:26,40 --> 00:05:30,640
And this is where low code automation can kick in. The last thing that we're ultimately 

66
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:35,640
trying to do is become more productive. So how do we empower content creators to 

67
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,400
get a whole lot of stuff done, which is involved with this business, with the limited 

68
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,520
resources of just some AI agents?

69
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:49,210
So let's start off with a tutorial on effective prompt engineering. And to do that, 

70
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:54,530
we're going to do it from a storytelling perspective by talking about a woman and 

71
00:05:54,530 --> 00:06:00,410
her cat in New York as a storytelling construct. And when I'm doing prompt engineering, 

72
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:04,890
it's all about breaking it down into the component parts, such as, in this case, 

73
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:09,530
a structured sequence of events. We've also got the protagonist, which happens to 

74
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:13,930
be the woman, the environment, or the scene which happens to be New York, and the 

75
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:16,970
fact that she has another character being her cat.

76
00:06:17,00 --> 00:06:20,970
With that information in place, we give the structure of what we want to create, 

77
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:26,10
which is a five scene write up, and we would like something dramatic maybe in the 

78
00:06:26,10 --> 00:06:31,410
third scene. And from there we end up getting storytelling that's over five different 

79
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:36,650
scenes. Now, the next thing that we want to do from here is get some sort of visualization. 

80
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:41,170
But before we do the visualization, we need to create what's called a shot list.

81
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:46,690
Now the shot list is just a simple continuation of the story we just created, just 

82
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:51,210
with a little bit of output formatting. In this case, create a simplified shot list, 

83
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:55,810
and we see that information coming through. And there's a lot of visual componentry 

84
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,770
going into what's being written.

85
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:02,380
Now that we've got the story and the shot list, we can go into generating prompts 

86
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:06,580
that allow us to generate these images in something like Leonardo AI.

87
00:07:07,30 --> 00:07:11,960
Now to create images effectively. The things that are important is that firstly, 

88
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:16,920
we continue the context of the previous part of the conversation with an output format, 

89
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:21,960
which is generate a concise image prompt. After that, we give the aesthetic style 

90
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:27,400
that we want. It's pretty simple here. It's just New York City, a woman 2025. And 

91
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:31,680
then lastly, because there are multiple characters, we want to make sure that each 

92
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:37,640
of the characters are stylistically the same in every scene. Last thing we need is 

93
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:41,960
to see a cat that's brown in one scene and black in the next scene.

94
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:46,690
So we continue the conversation. And one of the things that you notice is that all 

95
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:51,650
the image prompts that have been generated all have the same fluffy orange tabby 

96
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:57,90
cat in each of the scenes. So hopefully we're going to get visual consistency. So 

97
00:07:57,90 --> 00:08:01,450
when we start running this through Leonardo AI, you end up with a bunch of images 

98
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:06,170
that look pretty good. We can notice in the third scene that there is a dramatic 

99
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:09,290
issue going on here. The cat is escaping in the park.

100
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:15,110
So we have our final story of the woman in her 30s in New York with her cat. But 

101
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:20,150
what if we want to take this same story and restructure it for a different period 

102
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:26,230
in time? And for this, let's go with Elizabethan times or Shakespeare Hamlet sort 

103
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:32,150
of style. From that, we can just take a new prompt, a reframe prompt. We ensure that 

104
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:36,150
the woman and the cat are in each scene, but the scene should be quite different 

105
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:41,30
because it's a different period in time. And we do have a reinforcement part of the 

106
00:08:41,30 --> 00:08:45,870
prompt that says that only image prompts are expected. The woman and the cat should 

107
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:49,150
have visual consistency across every scene.

108
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:54,620
And so now we have our noble woman and her cat in London. It's a similar sort of 

109
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:58,780
concept, but one of the things that you notice when you see them side by side is 

110
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:03,820
that there is a little bit of a flaw. The blonde woman in the first scene is a little 

111
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:08,380
bit different colored blonde, and then she becomes silver and then a darker brunette, 

112
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:13,460
followed by silver at the end. And what we're looking at is what I call instructional 

113
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:18,220
collapse in prompt engineering. So in the next section let's see how we can improve 

114
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,180
that with AI workflows.

115
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:24,500
So in the scale framework we've just looked at Structured Prompt engineering. Now 

116
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:29,420
we're going to look at crafting workflows. And these are simple prompt chains that 

117
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:34,980
you put in place to execute the same sort of instructions over and over again in 

118
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:40,940
a systematic way. And I like to use them in three main areas business optimization, 

119
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:44,930
creative processes like you're seeing in this presentation or in a lot of the YouTube 

120
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:50,770
videos I do, or personal productivity, maybe writing an email or a Facebook message.

121
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:56,450
Now, if you're doing workflows correctly, you also have extended tools such as fine 

122
00:09:56,450 --> 00:10:02,10
tuning, retrieval, augmented generation, memory, human in the loop to interact with 

123
00:10:02,10 --> 00:10:07,450
the AI, and maybe different models to solve different problems. So let's have a look 

124
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:12,890
at it from a marketing agency point of view. So let's say you're a digital marketing 

125
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:17,730
company and you've got a lot of workflows that you're doing for many clients. And 

126
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:21,890
it's the same workflows over and over again. And this was one such company I was 

127
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:25,690
working with. And we were looking at the different workflows they've got and just 

128
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:30,570
putting them into structured, prompt chains that they could run over and over again.

129
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:34,470
Now, one of the things I found interesting about working with this company, that 

130
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:39,230
is that there's a lot of similarity between being a YouTuber, publishing LinkedIn 

131
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:44,30
articles and being an SEO agency, creating various forms of content. 

132
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:50,430
I also worked recently with a branding agency, and what they had put in place already 

133
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:56,190
was competitive analysis, market research tools in the form of prompt packs. And 

134
00:10:56,190 --> 00:11:00,710
these prompt packs were done in Canva. They had nice little video walkthroughs of 

135
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:05,190
how to use them, and they were quite simple in nature. Basically a bunch of prompts 

136
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:10,430
that a customer could just copy paste into large language model of choice, maybe 

137
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:16,350
modify a few input variables. So this is a simplistic way of getting your first prompt 

138
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,550
chains up and running.

139
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:23,80
Now as a YouTuber, using prompt chains can be effective in all sorts of areas, like 

140
00:11:23,80 --> 00:11:28,560
creation and optimization of your content. You might want to repurpose and redistribute 

141
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:34,920
it as an article or as a carousel, or you might want to deal with analyzing the comments 

142
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:39,200
or building some sort of offer to a sponsorship deal.

143
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:44,550
So let's look at a tool I use internally called the Agent Workflow Builder to create 

144
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:49,680
videos. And one of the workflows I go through is the YouTube Launch Optimizer. It's 

145
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,390
a 30 step workflow that I go through every time I release a video, but one of the 

146
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:59,790
steps involved here is the YouTube titles. So when we were looking at the video at 

147
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:05,910
the beginning of this session called the 5 5 5 Manifesto and the Mountain of Mastery, 

148
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:10,440
I would've run that through a title generator. I would've said the short title is 

149
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:16,230
the 5 5 5 Manifesto. It's main topic is it's about spiral learning, and I would put 

150
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:20,460
in a couple of content highlights. Now, the good thing about this is it would run 

151
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:26,100
a prompt through Chat GPT in this case, and we'd get a bunch of YouTube titles ready 

152
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,00
to get started. 

153
00:12:27,30 --> 00:12:33,10
Now, personally, I use Vid IQ a lot when I want to use Title Generation, but what 

154
00:12:33,40 --> 00:12:38,650
I love about doing it within the age of Workflow Builder is I have full control over 

155
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:43,180
the way titles of being created. So I use it as a first pass, and then I finish off 

156
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:43,780
with Vid iq.

157
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:49,730
So let's get into a more detailed workflow. Let's look at story building. And in 

158
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:53,570
the video that we saw at the beginning, it starts off with legends are forged in 

159
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:58,190
the fires of the YouTube battlefield. Let's just play that for a second so that you 

160
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:02,870
can see what it sounds like. Again, legends are forged in the fires of the YouTube 

161
00:13:03,50 --> 00:13:03,740
battlefield. 

162
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,480
Only the strongest, the most persistent. 

163
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:11,130
And so you can see there that we've got nothing more than a transcript, and with 

164
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:15,730
this transcript we can run it through various processes. So the first one I wanna 

165
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:20,830
look at is the shot list that we talked about with the woman in New York, and we're 

166
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:24,870
doing some prompt engineering around coming up with shot lists. And one of the things 

167
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:30,550
that you notice with a scene is that there's more than one concept going here. Firstly, 

168
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:35,200
we've got the scene itself is a mountain in the background, but in the foreground 

169
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:40,90
we've got two different ideas going on. Firstly, we've got the protagonist, the hero 

170
00:13:40,90 --> 00:13:45,390
in the story, in the red robes. The second thing we've got is a main artifact or 

171
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:48,490
item. In this case, it happens to be a sword.

172
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:54,790
Now, the specific details are really important when you're generating graphics and 

173
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:59,470
prompts and stuff like that. So I start off with the primary character generator, 

174
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:04,430
and this is where I work through and solidify what the character is going to look 

175
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:08,710
like. After that, I'll look at the other characters that might be the villains, they 

176
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:14,230
might be the other characters within the story, and how do I get them consistently 

177
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:18,630
looking the same across different scenes? After that, I want to work on the scenes 

178
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:23,150
themselves. Can I come up with a style that's repeatable that I can reuse to get 

179
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:26,910
nice effects? And one of the things that you see in a scene is there's all sorts 

180
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:32,30
of objects, but sometimes there's a major object, and the major object would be something 

181
00:14:32,30 --> 00:14:37,750
like the 555 manifesto, where I want to define that and work through consistently 

182
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:41,830
being able to reproduce it in various scenes of the video.

183
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:46,840
Now as an example, and we'll only talk about the primary character. I've developed 

184
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:51,150
two different styles. So here I've put myself in a black shirt and I've run it through 

185
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:56,510
style one and style two. I decided I liked style two more, but I didn't want to work 

186
00:14:56,510 --> 00:15:00,70
with the black shirt, so I just took a different picture of myself 

187
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:04,940
And you can see that the image on the right was used in the Mountain of Mastery YouTube 

188
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:05,580
trailer.

189
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,330
Now we've crafting workflows out of the way. Let's look into the next two sections, 

190
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:17,810
which is AI agents and using low code tools. So an AI agent is an automation generally, 

191
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:23,330
but quite often we'll also do a human in the loop sort of visual interface. So when 

192
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:29,90
it comes to using Vidiq, we can see that a video that I did, I put in a title and 

193
00:15:29,90 --> 00:15:34,850
it said your score is only 66. But what it did was suggest better ones. And I went 

194
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:40,450
with the one that was 96. So this is a very simple human in the loop interface, backed 

195
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:46,250
by agent workflows such as the one that I build for myself. But another way of looking 

196
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:50,770
at this, and this is where low code tools can come in, is that you can use a tool 

197
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:51,770
like pickaxe.

198
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:57,810
Now I've done four videos on this particular tool, but just as a recap, if we look 

199
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:04,650
at these little tools that are AI driven, such as the YouTube title generator, again, 

200
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:08,530
working on similar principles to what we saw in the Agent Workflow Builder,, you 

201
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:13,970
can come along, fill in a little bit of information, and get a list of titles generated 

202
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:18,850
or using a tool that you can market, you can reuse, you can give away to different 

203
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:24,330
people. Another tool that I've done is the video advertisement script writer. And 

204
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:29,650
the idea of this is creating an advert script that converts. So you put in a few 

205
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:34,60
inputs and here we've got the hook that says, "hey, yeah, you scrolling mindlessly, 

206
00:16:34,60 --> 00:16:39,840
still thinking of those get rich quick videos will save your ass. Spoiler alert they 

207
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,570
won't." And that's a hook. 

208
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:45,750
We've got the pain in the villain, the reveal and then the call to action all at 

209
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:46,470
the end of it.

210
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:53,70
So with the scale framework out of the way, let's move on to Emotional Support Spiders. 

211
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:58,150
And this is something that I came up with a couple of years ago working with ChatGPT,.

212
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:03,400
And the idea was looking at the concept of emotional support animals or companion 

213
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:09,40
animals and doing it differently, doing it as a storytelling in a multiverse sort 

214
00:17:09,40 --> 00:17:14,640
of event. And so this is called Emotional Support Spiders. It's an idea in which 

215
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,400
there are two sentient races. You've got humans and you've got spiders. And what 

216
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,160
we're trying to do within it is create buddy stories.

217
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:28,390
this has been thought of from the very beginning as a multi-agent storytelling system, 

218
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:33,830
where each story can have irony and contrast. We can create trust and connection 

219
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:38,190
between two different characters that are quite different from one another. We can 

220
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:43,910
explore concepts like truth and trauma, hopefully so that we can get inspiration 

221
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:45,150
and hope out of it all.

222
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:49,490
Now, from the multi-agent point of view, the images that you're seeing, which were 

223
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:55,490
done in Midjourney a couple of years ago, were the idea, could you take individual 

224
00:17:55,530 --> 00:18:01,530
images of the spider and the human and create a story narrative back stories? Can 

225
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:07,170
we create forward stories? Join us stories where people come together to form relationships. 

226
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:12,770
And this is where various agents that arrive, a one off character related or storytelling, 

227
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:15,210
are being reused over and over again.

228
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:20,650
So the way I start storytelling is from a world narrative. This is a set of one-off 

229
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:26,800
agents that define the world that we live in. And the first agent is around philosophical 

230
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:31,120
view of the world. Do I want to have a bit of Buddhism? Do I want some Christianity? 

231
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:35,920
Do I want something else? And the way I like to do this is have a simple human in 

232
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:40,480
the loop interface where I fill in a few values and then behind the scenes use an 

233
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:47,170
agent workflow system such as NA 10 or Zapier to implement and build out all the 

234
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:53,170
information. After that, we can move on to a design and visualization agent. And 

235
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:58,120
when you look at the images in this screenshot at the moment, if we go back one and 

236
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:03,820
we see the spider and the man, and we've got all this stone work, it's a rock mural 

237
00:19:04,60 --> 00:19:08,770
sort of system. And this is going to be repeated through the next set of slides. 

238
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:15,640
And to do this, we need to get a design guide going. So we start off by another human 

239
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:20,380
in the loop sort of input form, run it through a bunch of agents to come up with 

240
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,600
a consistent style that we want to use.

241
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:27,590
Now. After that, we need to come up with a detailed fact sheet of what is a human 

242
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:33,270
and what is a spider. And you can think of it the same way as you might a role playing 

243
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:37,630
game, a Dungeons and Dragons, where you've got these attribute sheets that make sense 

244
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:42,350
for humans, and you've got a different attribute sheets that make sense for monsters 

245
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,470
as an example. 

246
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:48,610
With our general worldview agents in place, especially this species traits one, we 

247
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:54,10
can now move on to the character development itself. So if we are developing a human 

248
00:19:54,10 --> 00:19:58,270
character, one of the things that we wanna do is come up with the attributes, the 

249
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:03,610
sort of stuff that happens when they're born. So with that, do we want to know what 

250
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:08,950
their hair color is? The height that they grow to, what are their general fears and 

251
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:14,80
problems going on in life? What are their desires? We want to do this same concept 

252
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:20,50
with the spiders themselves, and we use a different agent, mainly because the goals, 

253
00:20:20,80 --> 00:20:24,460
the behaviors, they're going to be different between the two different species. With 

254
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:29,530
that in place, we can then start to build a timeline of where they are in life, so 

255
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:31,420
they got born, but where are 

256
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:37,560
maybe we've got a human that's 13 years of age. Can we build up a storyline from 

257
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:42,540
the attribute sheet all the way up to that period in time? Now, if we can do that, 

258
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:48,150
we can then start to determine the sort of behaviors and mannerisms that each character 

259
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:48,780
has.

260
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:54,40
Now, before we build any stories around these characters, a couple of additional 

261
00:20:54,40 --> 00:20:59,680
agents that can be useful is that if a scene, a scenario, an action happens, how 

262
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:06,80
does that change their behavior? What's their motivations? Do they lead into a positive 

263
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,680
sort of let's move forward in the world, or do they become a bit of a victim now, 

264
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:15,840
no matter what the mapping comes with, the next thing is to read that and put it 

265
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:21,320
back into the character. So if I have a confronting situation and I rise above it, 

266
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:26,840
how do we write that information back into the DNA of who I am as a character? 

267
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:32,140
With all our character development, our timelines in place, we can move on to scenario 

268
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:37,20
writing. And I like to have a different agent for the different types of scenarios 

269
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:42,100
that can happen in the Emotional Support Spiders world. So the first one is that 

270
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:46,420
when you've got two characters that have never met, what brings them together, and 

271
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:51,860
usually that's a dramatic scene, such as a bird attacking the spider and a human 

272
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:55,380
coming in to save the spider. In this particular 

273
00:21:55,690 --> 00:22:00,610
Now that dramatic, emotionally charged scene can lead to a bonding. And with the 

274
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:06,90
bonding, we can then go into them sharing their backstory, sharing what they've done, 

275
00:22:06,90 --> 00:22:09,730
and finding commonality in hanging out with one another.

276
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:15,280
Now the Buddy story scenario is a classic in Hollywood. We've seen it in Lethal Weapon, 

277
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:20,890
Dumb and Dumber Bill and Ted's excellent adventure. So what I like to do is now that 

278
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:25,660
we've got this in place, how do these two characters move forward in the future? 

279
00:22:26,20 --> 00:22:31,540
And we do that using a new sort of writer that is more on an episode by episode basis 

280
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:36,940
or a day-to-day basis. And so the first one we have is what we saw when we were looking 

281
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:42,610
at the woman and her cat a day in the life story. So we do a scenario based story 

282
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:48,310
based on the idea that we have a world philosophical view. We had the design of the 

283
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:52,900
world. We understand what a human and a spider is from a characteristics point of 

284
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:53,320
view. 

285
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:58,490
We now also have the individual profile or DNA of the spider and the human, their 

286
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:03,530
timeline, their backstory. We also know how they came together in traumatic fashion 

287
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:08,990
to become friends. So now when we just paint a simple scene for a day in the life 

288
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:14,300
story, we've got all this rich information to drive it. After that, we wanna move 

289
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:19,10
into the actual shot list. Again, we did that with the woman and her cat. One of 

290
00:23:19,10 --> 00:23:23,600
the things that happens though, when you are doing shot lists, and we can use agents 

291
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:29,900
to do this, is not all scenes will be correct. So let's say we wanted grays and oranges 

292
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:33,50
throughout every scene and we get one that's pink. 

293
00:23:33,60 --> 00:23:37,410
In this particular case, we will tell the agent and say, look, you got this one a 

294
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:41,940
little bit incorrect. Can you regenerate the prompt so that we can regenerate the 

295
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:42,630
images?

296
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:47,220
So that gives you some context of how emotional support spiders are put together 

297
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:51,330
with different agents. The next thing is looking a little bit at the technicality 

298
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:56,850
of it all, and it's really quite simple. What we do is we build little agent workflows. 

299
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:02,340
We can use tools like N 18 or we can code them directly in Python or JavaScript. 

300
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:07,710
From there, we just need to hook 'em up to human in the loop interfaces. So when 

301
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:12,360
we're building in the world philosophy, we'll run in a few pieces of information, 

302
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:16,350
send it to a workflow. After that, we want to figure out what's this world going 

303
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:21,60
to look like? It's just another workflow. When we get onto dealing with the human, 

304
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:25,740
this is on a per human basis or on a per spider basis, 

305
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:29,440
we're defining, how they look, what their motivations are. After that, we run both 

306
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:35,230
workflows through the Backstory generator and we just continue to do this for each 

307
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:37,210
of the different agents that we're trying to build.

308
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:42,250
So with everything in place, the next thing is to create a story of some form and 

309
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:47,920
the day in the life stories can look like this. Here we have a boy and an emotional 

310
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:53,500
support spider in this particular case, and the boy has been invited to a party but 

311
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:58,240
doesn't know how to associate with people. So from there, we add in a little bit 

312
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,130
of a narrative over the top of it, 

313
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:06,600
put in some magic animations sort of stuff that we can do in DZine or Leonardo ai. 

314
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:11,910
I've got links in the description for both of them. And from there we simply animate 

315
00:25:12,00 --> 00:25:17,850
the scene. We've got the boy down at the beach and being befriended by a spider in 

316
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:23,700
this particular case. Later on they're at his house where he's teaching them about 

317
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:28,320
computer programming and stuff like that. Later in the day, there's a dramatic scene. 

318
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:32,400
This time the father is angry upstairs, so there's a bit of comfort going 

319
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:37,570
and then we finish the scene with a little bit of hope. They're down at the beach 

320
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,950
and they're playing together.

321
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:45,670
So this was the presentation I gave over at Ecamm Live Leap last night, and it talks 

322
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:50,860
about the scale framework, the structured prompts, creative workflows, the agents, 

323
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:56,20
the low code frameworks, and how we put it together to empower creators. And then 

324
00:25:56,20 --> 00:26:01,240
moving on to the emotional support spiders, which is a system that's in developed 

325
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:07,270
by myself so that I can do multi-agent storytelling. Now, if you wanna find out more 

326
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:12,190
about how the actual video structures are being put together, you can come over to 

327
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:17,830
the A-I-T-L-D-R channel where we do a lot of videos that are all AI generated and 

328
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:22,90
there's a lot of storytelling going on. Or if you wanna learn more about the agent 

329
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:25,660
