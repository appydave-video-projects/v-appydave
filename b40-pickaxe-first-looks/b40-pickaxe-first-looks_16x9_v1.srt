1
00:00:00,066 --> 00:00:03,533
In this video, we're taking a first
look at Pickaxe,

2
00:00:03,533 --> 00:00:06,733
which is an AI workflow builder or chat
bot builder.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,166
Now here we are on the home page.

4
00:00:09,166 --> 00:00:10,566
Scroll down. You can have a look

5
00:00:10,566 --> 00:00:13,666
at the different capabilities
that are available right here.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,933
So the first thing is that you can build
your own chat bot or wizards.

7
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:20,400
You can customize the look and feel.

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,333
This is so that you can put it
on your own website.

9
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:24,533
You can monetize it.

10
00:00:24,533 --> 00:00:29,433
So set up different payment plans for
your customers that are using your tools.

11
00:00:29,633 --> 00:00:34,766
And lastly, you can monitor the analytics
and the capability of the chat bots

12
00:00:34,766 --> 00:00:35,600
that you're building.

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,333
So let's dive
a little deeper into this application.

14
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:42,333
And we can say that it's a no code
platform

15
00:00:42,366 --> 00:00:45,533
that builds human in the loop
AI workflows.

16
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:51,466
What that means is that your end users
can use simple forms or chat bots

17
00:00:51,766 --> 00:00:56,833
to interact with AI workflows that you've
pre-configured with your own prompts.

18
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:00,300
Now, if you scroll down,
you'll see that it's a bunch of FAQs.

19
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,500
But if you're interested

20
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,566
in learning any specific capability
within Pickaxe after this

21
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:09,033
first video, then check out the playlist
that'll be at the end.

22
00:01:09,366 --> 00:01:12,866
But moving forward,
what we're going to do is work with this

23
00:01:12,866 --> 00:01:16,366
first option in creating a Pickaxe,
which is the form.

24
00:01:16,633 --> 00:01:21,366
So we also have conversational bots,
which is a little bit like ChatGPT.

25
00:01:21,766 --> 00:01:26,133
Now the form system is similar to a tool
that I use internally called

26
00:01:26,133 --> 00:01:30,733
the Agent Workflow Builder, and I use this
whenever I'm launching a video.

27
00:01:30,733 --> 00:01:33,133
I go through all these different
workflow steps,

28
00:01:33,133 --> 00:01:36,633
and the one that we're going to look at
today is the title ideas.

29
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,800
So with this particular form
that I've used in the past,

30
00:01:41,033 --> 00:01:44,500
I can take a transcript and I can feed
in a little bit of information

31
00:01:44,633 --> 00:01:47,300
and get a rich YouTube title from it.

32
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,600
We'll see if we can do the same thing
by clicking on here.

33
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,066
And let's get started.

34
00:01:52,066 --> 00:01:54,633
Now when you're in the form builder
you have two areas.

35
00:01:54,633 --> 00:01:57,100
The area on the right
is what we're building.

36
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,533
The area on the left is where
we're doing a lot of the configuration.

37
00:02:00,566 --> 00:02:03,900
Now there is the ability
to add information on the right as well.

38
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:08,533
So what we're going to do is we'll call
this a YouTube title generator.

39
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,366
Now I've just gone to the next page.

40
00:02:11,366 --> 00:02:12,766
This is started drawing.

41
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:17,566
So it's taken whatever title you did
and come up with a starter image

42
00:02:17,566 --> 00:02:18,933
that you might want to work with.

43
00:02:18,933 --> 00:02:21,600
If we click on it
we can give it a different prompt.

44
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,566
I'm just gonna go with this
and I might just call it logo for now.

45
00:02:25,566 --> 00:02:27,100
I think that'll be the simplest.

46
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,200
And let's see what we get from this.

47
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,466
And so it's drawn something
which is not very readable.

48
00:02:32,466 --> 00:02:35,033
So I think we'll go back to illustrated.

49
00:02:35,033 --> 00:02:38,600
We'll do a generate
one more time and see what comes through.

50
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,800
And with a little bit of experimentation
we'll go with this one.

51
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,533
Now the next step I want to do
is describe what this tool does.

52
00:02:45,533 --> 00:02:49,633
And I think the easiest way is
if we go and select all the information

53
00:02:49,633 --> 00:02:53,633
from the original prompt, and what we'll
do is we'll head over to checkpoint.

54
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,200
We've got a pasted in
and we just got a little

55
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,600
turn it into a description
sort of capability.

56
00:03:00,866 --> 00:03:02,633
And we'll copy all that information.

57
00:03:02,633 --> 00:03:07,266
And if we head back over here and paste it
in, this 300 character

58
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,233
description should be enough
to give a basic information

59
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:14,100
to a user about what
the tool is going to do.

60
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:17,933
Now, at this point,
I want to generate the prompt for this.

61
00:03:17,933 --> 00:03:21,166
So if we click over on the prompt menu
you've got both

62
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:24,333
the main prompt
for generating the information you want.

63
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:25,966
But we've also got the role.

64
00:03:25,966 --> 00:03:28,300
And I'm just going to take a copy
of this information.

65
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,866
What we'll do
is we'll head over to ChatGPT

66
00:03:30,866 --> 00:03:33,266
where I'm just giving it that example.

67
00:03:33,266 --> 00:03:34,500
We just copied it.

68
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,900
I've also just asked it
to write a role for me.

69
00:03:38,033 --> 00:03:40,400
So let's see what it comes up with.

70
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,300
And it's going.

71
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,300
You are a seasoned
YouTube title strategist,

72
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:48,300
SEO, ten compelling, under 70
characters, etc..

73
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,600
Now, I've just mentioned

74
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:54,033
to my own chat bot
that this information we're currently got,

75
00:03:54,066 --> 00:03:55,866
it's already
going to be in the main prompt.

76
00:03:55,866 --> 00:04:01,000
So we'll just simplify the role right
here, and we'll come back and take a copy

77
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,500
of the prompt that we do want to build
what they're calling the prompt frame.

78
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:06,833
And we'll paste that in.

79
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:09,633
And then we'll figure out what we need
to change in here.

80
00:04:09,633 --> 00:04:13,500
So with my prompt in place,
the main change I've done is

81
00:04:13,533 --> 00:04:17,533
I've just added a title between each
input that I want to have.

82
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,033
We've got this “You are a specialist”.

83
00:04:20,033 --> 00:04:24,300
We can get rid of that because this
information is going to be up in the role.

84
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,300
But the rest of the rules
are what we can configure

85
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,500
over time and find improvements from now.

86
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,400
Let's have a look at the model

87
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,733
we can choose from.

88
00:04:33,733 --> 00:04:38,200
So when you click on this you're
going to see that we are on a free plan.

89
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,933
And we can pick the GPT-4.1 nano
or the mini.

90
00:04:42,133 --> 00:04:43,633
And it's come with mini by default.

91
00:04:43,633 --> 00:04:46,433
But nano model’s had be a great one
to work with.

92
00:04:46,433 --> 00:04:51,200
Now I found it a little confusing
what was considered pro and gold.

93
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:56,066
So we've got this Claude 3 Opus
and GPT 4.1 as pro.

94
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,933
Now when you look at the pricing model,
the Pro is actually the top plan.

95
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:05,333
And I would have thought that something
like the GPT 3.7 Sonnet

96
00:05:05,633 --> 00:05:08,066
might have been something
that would appear in the pro,

97
00:05:08,066 --> 00:05:09,466
but you get it in the gold.

98
00:05:09,466 --> 00:05:13,533
So if you do an upgrade to $23/month,
again,

99
00:05:13,533 --> 00:05:15,733
there's an affiliate link
in the description.

100
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:20,300
You'll be able to select that particular
model when you're generating information.

101
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,800
Now at the moment I've got this
three areas where I want to put the

102
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,700
user inputs.

103
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,866
And the way you can do
it is by adding a user input like this.

104
00:05:27,866 --> 00:05:29,500
And you'll see these values.

105
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,333
So what we'll do is would go under shot
title add one.

106
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:37,066
There we go under video topic same
and we'll go under Content Highlights.

107
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:40,333
Now if there's something
that you don't want like this one

108
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:43,600
we can just come over here
and press the delete button.

109
00:05:43,866 --> 00:05:47,800
But with that in place
we should go and copy the different titles

110
00:05:48,033 --> 00:05:53,200
and make sure it's just nice
for the user to read and understand.

111
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,800
We'll find content highlights.

112
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,866
Now, I think the control is covering
is covered

113
00:05:59,866 --> 00:06:03,766
by my head at the moment, but to the right
is this little short answer.

114
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:08,500
And for the content highlights down here,
I'm going to make it long answer.

115
00:06:08,533 --> 00:06:11,766
So if I just go and do that
and press long answer.

116
00:06:11,766 --> 00:06:13,366
This will get a little bit bigger.

117
00:06:13,366 --> 00:06:16,333
Gives us access
to a thousand characters of input.

118
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:20,266
What I'd like to do next is test it out
so we can fill in values

119
00:06:20,266 --> 00:06:21,966
down in the bottom right hand corner.

120
00:06:21,966 --> 00:06:25,133
There's a test prompt,
but to get us started,

121
00:06:25,133 --> 00:06:28,133
let's work with one I've done in the past.

122
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:31,333
This is that same prompt
with some values filled in,

123
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:32,833
and we'll use it as a reference.

124
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:36,900
So I'm going to copy the
AI workflows for content creators.

125
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:41,166
I haven't actually done a video in
about a month for being moving over space,

126
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:44,166
and I've just arrived in Chiang Mai,
Thailand,

127
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:49,066
and it's taken me a while to get back up
and running with video content.

128
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,466
But what we'll do
is we'll take all this content highlights

129
00:06:52,866 --> 00:06:55,866
that are done
when whenever I did this video

130
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:00,733
and we'll paste all the information in
and I'm going to click the test prompt.

131
00:07:00,733 --> 00:07:04,100
We're currently
running the GPT 4o mini.

132
00:07:04,366 --> 00:07:10,333
Let's press that looks like I went 51
characters over the limit of 1000,

133
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,700
but in the original one, this is the
sort of information I had before.

134
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:17,266
And when we look at it over here,

135
00:07:17,266 --> 00:07:21,666
it looks like a pretty good list of titles
that we can work with.

136
00:07:21,933 --> 00:07:24,700
Now, have we used a credit?

137
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,400
And the answer is, I don't know.

138
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,400
This is the first time
I've used this myself

139
00:07:29,633 --> 00:07:33,633
and what we'll do is we'll
just jump into Nano and we'll just test

140
00:07:33,766 --> 00:07:35,366
the prompt one more time.

141
00:07:35,366 --> 00:07:38,766
And AI responds right here and look,

142
00:07:38,866 --> 00:07:43,833
without actually going deep
and having a look at them side by side.

143
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:46,433
And this is actually something
I wasn't aware of,

144
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:50,200
is that I've lost the output
of the previous example.

145
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:55,033
But from here, these are
pretty good titles to get started with.

146
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:59,033
Now, before I demonstrate the Pickaxe,
I just want to explain a couple of things,

147
00:07:59,033 --> 00:08:01,733
including a big problem
that I encountered.

148
00:08:01,733 --> 00:08:03,966
So the first is, from a cost
point of view,

149
00:08:03,966 --> 00:08:07,533
the two tests that you've seen me
do have cost to credit.

150
00:08:07,533 --> 00:08:10,000
So we've got 48 to go.

151
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Now, if you go and have a look
at my dashboard at the moment,

152
00:08:13,133 --> 00:08:17,333
one of the things that you'll notice
is that there are no Pickaxes listed.

153
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:22,433
There is a studio and the reason
this happened is that I was configuring

154
00:08:22,433 --> 00:08:26,333
the Pickaxe that you just saw in the video,
and then I pressed a button

155
00:08:26,733 --> 00:08:30,300
which took me to an information screen
and everything got lost.

156
00:08:30,433 --> 00:08:35,800
So what we're going to do is we're going
to click on the new Pickaxe again.

157
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,800
We're going to go in and click on the form
and I'm going

158
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,533
to show you a recreation
and what not to do.

159
00:08:42,633 --> 00:08:46,266
So here we are
at the new Pickaxe now on a different tab.

160
00:08:46,266 --> 00:08:48,766
I've gone and recreated it again.

161
00:08:48,766 --> 00:08:52,533
And the reason this all happened
is that I lost all the information

162
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:56,666
is that as you're filling
this out, it's not actually being saved.

163
00:08:56,833 --> 00:09:00,133
And I was just having a look around down
below and I clicked on this

164
00:09:00,133 --> 00:09:01,433
“more options”.

165
00:09:01,433 --> 00:09:02,233
And what it did was

166
00:09:02,233 --> 00:09:05,300
take me to a different page
and I couldn't figure out how to go back.

167
00:09:05,466 --> 00:09:08,666
So I press the back button
and everything was gone.

168
00:09:08,866 --> 00:09:12,100
So what we'll do right now
is press the publish button

169
00:09:12,266 --> 00:09:15,133
and hopefully what's going to happen
is this now site.

170
00:09:15,133 --> 00:09:18,933
So just be aware that at the moment
there's probably a few changes

171
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:22,233
I need to make to this product
to make it a bit more sound,

172
00:09:22,233 --> 00:09:27,000
but we now have a YouTube
title generator, so we're now on a page

173
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,333
where we've got a URL, which would be
to our YouTube title generator.

174
00:09:31,533 --> 00:09:35,633
We've also got this concept
called website, and that's telling us

175
00:09:35,633 --> 00:09:38,733
your website is a canvas
to hold all your Pickaxes.

176
00:09:38,966 --> 00:09:43,166
So I think what we can do
is just go and open that.

177
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:47,400
And it's again, it's opening it in page,
not in a new page.

178
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,466
So we've got it all listed here.

179
00:09:49,466 --> 00:09:53,700
It says home
and we're not saying our title generator.

180
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,300
And what I think that is because of

181
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:00,500
if we go and click on it right here,
there's this website unlisted.

182
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,666
So what we'll do
is we'll say listed right here.

183
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:07,433
And you can't see it
because my head is covering it I think.

184
00:10:07,533 --> 00:10:13,100
But we'll go and click back on this
and see if that's become available.

185
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:17,600
Yes. It has now got the YouTube title
generator, which I can click on

186
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,866
and that should take us to 
our title generator.

187
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,800
If we just go back one more time,

188
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,833
we should also be able to click on it
by using this button.

189
00:10:27,933 --> 00:10:30,966
So if we use this button right here
that actually opened it

190
00:10:30,966 --> 00:10:34,400
in a new tab, which was more
what I wanted to see happen before.

191
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:39,300
And we can minimize this area
and start working with it.

192
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,633
Now it's got the information that I left in.

193
00:10:42,633 --> 00:10:46,366
So the next thing I'm going to have to do
is go back and edit this

194
00:10:46,533 --> 00:10:50,800
so that that's actually
this is classed as placeholder text.

195
00:10:50,933 --> 00:10:52,933
So this is really good.

196
00:10:52,933 --> 00:10:55,366
So what we'll do now
is will test it for real.

197
00:10:55,366 --> 00:10:59,933
And what I've got down here is a bunch
of videos that I've done in the past.

198
00:10:59,933 --> 00:11:04,300
One was when I was recently made
redundant, and I did a video

199
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:08,900
on how I'm planning to create a digital
AI agency.

200
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:12,300
And so if we move further down
in this conversation,

201
00:11:12,566 --> 00:11:16,433
we should be able to find a short title
that we can work with.

202
00:11:16,433 --> 00:11:19,866
So a copy of that information,
I will just paste it in here.

203
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,633
And then we'll copy that information
and we'll grab that information

204
00:11:23,633 --> 00:11:25,266
and paste it in here.

205
00:11:25,266 --> 00:11:28,733
And we're within the limits
which is good to see.

206
00:11:28,966 --> 00:11:32,900
And these were the titles that were done
at that period of time

207
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,666
when I used it in ChatGPT.

208
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:37,600
But we'll just press submit.

209
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,566
And there is a “See history”.

210
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:43,400
So that's something I had an issue
with when testing it.

211
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:47,600
I wasn't able to see the earlier
title list,

212
00:11:47,733 --> 00:11:51,400
but apparently this has a “see history”,
so maybe we can see more.

213
00:11:51,733 --> 00:11:54,066
We've got information going down here.

214
00:11:54,066 --> 00:11:55,633
What does this do?

215
00:11:55,633 --> 00:12:00,633
And okay, maybe I'm
going to test it with another video.

216
00:12:00,633 --> 00:12:03,533
But let's just see
a comparison side by side.

217
00:12:03,533 --> 00:12:06,200
So what we've got on
the left is what it's come up with.

218
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,400
It's a good set of titles
now where it's a little different to

219
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,966
what I've done in the past
is that when I generated the titles

220
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:18,233
the first time around, I kind of liked
this particular one for the video.

221
00:12:18,233 --> 00:12:20,366
It's “Lost my job, found my purpose:

222
00:12:20,366 --> 00:12:21,533
Here's what I did”.

223
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:25,600
But I had access to conversation bot
because I was in ChatGPT

224
00:12:25,933 --> 00:12:29,833
and I was actually able
to improve this particular title.

225
00:12:30,033 --> 00:12:33,433
And where that ultimately got to
was this video

226
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:37,466
where according to VidIQ,
it had a 91 score.

227
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:41,600
And one of the things I just noticed
right now is that it's unlisted.

228
00:12:41,766 --> 00:12:46,200
I had it unlisted because there were
people that I was communicating with,

229
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,266
and I didn't want to tell them
that I had lost my job, mainly

230
00:12:50,266 --> 00:12:54,400
because for me, it was
this all happened a month and a half ago.

231
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:59,133
This is why I'm in Chiang Mai
and ended up with this great opportunity.

232
00:12:59,133 --> 00:13:02,366
But after four years,
it was also a little bit of ego

233
00:13:02,366 --> 00:13:05,366
busting going on because of the job
I was in.

234
00:13:05,533 --> 00:13:09,100
But that said, well, here
we've got on the right the titles

235
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,100
that you can see

236
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,766
and the improvements I can have,
because the conversational capability,

237
00:13:13,933 --> 00:13:17,633
we've got the titles
that are here on the left and earlier on

238
00:13:17,633 --> 00:13:22,966
I was looking to see how I could implement
chat capability into this,

239
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,066
which was the reason

240
00:13:24,066 --> 00:13:27,866
I actually lost all the information
which I talked about earlier in the video.

241
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:32,566
But what we'll do is we'll come back
to this particular list,

242
00:13:32,566 --> 00:13:37,733
we'll go to videos right here
and we'll find another one to work with.

243
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:40,733
So let's go with b10.

244
00:13:40,733 --> 00:13:44,333
And in here, if we look for that

245
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:48,633
title again, we've got another set of data
that we can use,

246
00:13:48,633 --> 00:13:53,666
so synthesizing multi conversational chats.

247
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:57,266
And is it a case of we can just update it
I think we can. Yep.

248
00:13:57,266 --> 00:13:58,800
All pretty easy.

249
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,933
We'll just press submit on that.

250
00:14:00,933 --> 00:14:04,333
And while that's generating whatever
it's doing we can go and have a look

251
00:14:04,366 --> 00:14:07,800
to what I had originally streamlined
ChatGPT chats

252
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,966
into actionable documents. 
And what have we got here?

253
00:14:11,966 --> 00:14:13,200
So there we go.

254
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,200
So the original one we just did
is down here

255
00:14:17,533 --> 00:14:21,900
and we've got the new one going on
right here, which is pretty cool.

256
00:14:21,933 --> 00:14:24,966
Now another thing to notice
is that the history of

257
00:14:24,966 --> 00:14:29,233
we can click on this particular one
if you want to go to them quickly.

258
00:14:29,433 --> 00:14:30,800
Now, if you're actually interested

259
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,166
in that particular video, like I said,
I've just made it public right now.

260
00:14:35,266 --> 00:14:38,966
It got a bunch of views in the first week,
and then I just turned it off.

261
00:14:39,366 --> 00:14:43,866
So let's go back and look at one
more aspect of this system.

262
00:14:43,866 --> 00:14:46,033
So one of the things you notice on
this page

263
00:14:46,033 --> 00:14:47,633
is that you've got this beautiful image.

264
00:14:47,633 --> 00:14:51,766
We've got a title, getting started,
and this is all customizable.

265
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:54,166
I'm going to do another video
on that in the future.

266
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:56,933
But I think we just need
to look at the usage.

267
00:14:56,933 --> 00:14:59,833
It's not quite showing you exactly
what's going on.

268
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:03,000
We've got the total users is two.

269
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,300
One use this today. Two users today.
And we can see the information going on.

270
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,800
But this is from the public facing
aspect of it.

271
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,433
It doesn't include the actual tests
we did.

272
00:15:13,433 --> 00:15:16,666
If we move over to the dashboard
we've got information here.

273
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:19,400
You click on the username,
you'll be taken over to this page

274
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,833
where you can see the actual pricing

275
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:24,966
and you can see the actual credits
we used, which is four

276
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:30,366
have been used. Two in testing, two
as part of the little micro application

277
00:15:30,366 --> 00:15:33,466
that we've published to the internet
for people to use.

278
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:34,633
So that's Pickaxe.

279
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:37,966
What we've done is we've created
our YouTube title generator.

280
00:15:37,966 --> 00:15:41,600
It's a little tool
that's been hooked up to a little website.

281
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,333
In the next video,
what I'll do is I'll play around

282
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:47,733
with a little bit of the designs
and create another workflow just to see

283
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:51,566
how flexible
this is in other sorts of situations.

284
00:15:51,566 --> 00:15:56,200
But if you want to work with me
one on one, then just head over to AppyDave.com

285
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,766
There's a there's a book
a call button that you can click on

286
00:15:58,766 --> 00:16:03,566
and that will take you to an area where
we can have a discovery call or just work

287
00:16:03,566 --> 00:16:08,766
one on one in a strategy session on prompt
engineering or AI agent workflows.

288
00:16:08,766 --> 00:16:11,833
I'm AppyDave.
Look forward to seeing you in the next video.
