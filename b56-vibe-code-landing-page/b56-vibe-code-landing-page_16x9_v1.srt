1
00:00:00,266 --> 00:00:04,566
You know, you can build landing pages
for websites like this one

2
00:00:04,566 --> 00:00:09,166
and a variation on it
just here using three simple prompts

3
00:00:09,166 --> 00:00:12,333
in most of the various AI pair programmers,

4
00:00:12,566 --> 00:00:14,833
and with a little bit of a custom
instruction,

5
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:19,133
you can even change it up a little bit
by giving it a bit of a Christmas theme.

6
00:00:19,167 --> 00:00:23,967
So stay tuned as we explore three prompts
that build these landing pages.

7
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,534
AI is all the rage. And you've decided that you want to create a little business 

8
00:00:29,634 --> 00:00:34,400
around something to do with AI and thought, I need a website, I need a landing page. 

9
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:39,134
And now you're researching. Should I use Wix? Should I use WordPress? How do I create 

10
00:00:39,134 --> 00:00:43,934
this? In this video, what I'd like to do is see if we can use three simple little 

11
00:00:43,934 --> 00:00:49,401
prompts, a little bit of prompt engineering and vibe coding, and create our own landing 

12
00:00:49,401 --> 00:00:52,768
page for a brand new business. I'm AppyDave,. Let's get into it.

13
00:00:53,001 --> 00:00:56,901
Vibe coding is getting really powerful in the last couple of months. We're seeing 

14
00:00:56,901 --> 00:01:02,301
an influx of people doing videos around this topic here at couple. I've done on building 

15
00:01:02,301 --> 00:01:07,968
application shells recently. You can check out these videos over on my YouTube channel, 

16
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:13,001
but I've also been using it to work through React and Tailwind Componentry. This 

17
00:01:13,001 --> 00:01:18,335
was a little application I put together yesterday and in the last week I've been 

18
00:01:18,335 --> 00:01:23,502
working on this application that uses ai. We can press little buttons here to preload 

19
00:01:23,502 --> 00:01:29,502
it with data, and as it works through, it can go off to external systems like N8N 

20
00:01:29,802 --> 00:01:35,602
this application will go off and use AI to get questions relating to an incident 

21
00:01:35,602 --> 00:01:37,069
in a medical situation.

22
00:01:37,069 --> 00:01:42,302
Now. The client for that project came to me yesterday, gave me a few pieces of information, 

23
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:47,802
such as a logo and a couple of supporting documents and said, can you turn this into 

24
00:01:47,802 --> 00:01:49,302
a website landing page? 

25
00:01:49,302 --> 00:01:53,269
And so today that's what we're going to try and do using just three prompts.

26
00:01:53,269 --> 00:01:58,836
So I think for today I am just going to go into ChatGTP and just get a starter conversation 

27
00:01:58,836 --> 00:02:04,303
going on with the main ideas. So if I was building a landing page for a new business 

28
00:02:04,303 --> 00:02:10,203
in HTML and Tailwind CSS, this is all the technology that I've said is available 

29
00:02:10,203 --> 00:02:10,903
at the moment 

30
00:02:11,203 --> 00:02:16,803
We need an agent or a person who is skilled in the art of making landing pages for 

31
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,603
websites, they understand marketing, that sort of stuff. 

32
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:24,470
the next thing we would need is the business or marketing collateral. So the information 

33
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,203
about the company or the business that we're trying to 

34
00:02:27,203 --> 00:02:31,737
promote on the website. And the last thing we need to know is what would be the requirements 

35
00:02:31,737 --> 00:02:36,904
document for the landing page? What would be the structure of the site? So I'm just 

36
00:02:36,904 --> 00:02:40,104
going to put this information in and press enter for now. 

37
00:02:40,104 --> 00:02:45,770
And what that's done is given us a breakdown of those three areas in just better 

38
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:50,637
writing than I could have done through the inputs. So we've got this role or agent 

39
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:56,571
definition, which is a marketing landing page designer. We've got the skills required 

40
00:02:56,571 --> 00:02:57,971
for that particular entity. 

41
00:02:57,971 --> 00:03:01,604
Now we've got the sort of information we should collect. I don't know that I'm gonna 

42
00:03:01,604 --> 00:03:06,038
have it all, but we've got brand identity, like the logo. We do have colors and fonts. 

43
00:03:06,038 --> 00:03:09,671
I don't have that at the moment. Don't currently have a mission and vision. I think. 

44
00:03:09,771 --> 00:03:13,671
I haven't actually read all the documents and I don't think that matters too much. 

45
00:03:13,871 --> 00:03:17,671
What you really wanna do is the better the information you have available, you just 

46
00:03:17,671 --> 00:03:21,238
feed it all in. But this is the sort of information you're trying to come up with. 

47
00:03:21,505 --> 00:03:26,572
And then the last one is, what would a requirements document or a product requirements 

48
00:03:26,572 --> 00:03:31,372
document look like and the structure? So we've got all this information here. We're 

49
00:03:31,372 --> 00:03:35,305
not going to implement it all. We're going to let AI do a lot of the work and we're 

50
00:03:35,305 --> 00:03:38,339
just gonna vibe code something that we're happy with. 

51
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:43,305
So because this is a video and we're doing things visually, I just turned that information 

52
00:03:43,305 --> 00:03:47,872
firstly into a PowerPoint presentation so I can describe it better to you. We need 

53
00:03:47,872 --> 00:03:52,106
an agent role definition. We need business marketing collateral. And we're going 

54
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:53,806
to need a requirements document.

55
00:03:53,806 --> 00:03:58,572
And I'm showing you this because when you're coding keep in mind that all the marketing 

56
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:03,839
imagery you want is as simple as taking the information and just shaping it into 

57
00:04:03,839 --> 00:04:09,673
a picture of a particular style. This particular image I just said create image 1609 

58
00:04:09,706 --> 00:04:15,639
aspect ratio. Use the Golden Age of Comics as the style that represents. And I said 

59
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:19,306
the three part section above as if it was a PowerPoint presentation.

60
00:04:19,306 --> 00:04:24,040
Now, the first prompt that I want to create is going to be a persona. So the way 

61
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,440
we'll do that is we will just select the information it has right here. And I've 

62
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,740
just started. Can you take the following information and turn it into a persona. 

63
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,807
We'll paste it in and we'll just press enter on that.

64
00:04:36,807 --> 00:04:42,540
So starting to write out information that we'll use in a variety of vibe coding environments. 

65
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:47,740
Now we have a persona document has been created. What I like to do here is just go 

66
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:53,240
into canvas mode. This information, we could use it from any number of vibe coding 

67
00:04:53,274 --> 00:04:58,341
tools, but we just copy the information. We can close that down. Head over to VS 

68
00:04:58,341 --> 00:05:03,241
code in this case. And I've just set up three blank documents. So the one we're starting 

69
00:05:03,241 --> 00:05:05,841
off with is going to be the persona. 

70
00:05:06,074 --> 00:05:10,874
we can see all the information that's there. We could edit it over here if we wanted 

71
00:05:10,874 --> 00:05:11,308
to.

72
00:05:11,308 --> 00:05:16,708
So the next thing we want to do is go and have a look at these documents. We've got 

73
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:23,908
two PDFs and a word document, and I'll just take us back to our GPT window. And essentially 

74
00:05:23,908 --> 00:05:28,675
I want to build this area using that information. So I've just started a prompt that 

75
00:05:28,675 --> 00:05:34,042
says can you develop a detailed overview of the company information using the attached 

76
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:37,908
documents? I'm also going to just paste in this regular information.

77
00:05:37,908 --> 00:05:43,042
Now if we bring up the folder view that we had earlier, we can see these three documents. 

78
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:47,409
And hopefully we can just drag them in here. They're now attached and they're loading 

79
00:05:47,409 --> 00:05:53,275
into memory. What I'd like it to do is read through all of these and apply the information, 

80
00:05:53,275 --> 00:06:04,076
and just see if we can get a detailed brief related to this particular organisation.
So that's just finished creating the information. We've got the company, it's called 

81
00:06:04,076 --> 00:06:10,176
Supporting Signal. We've got a mission and a vision. We've got brand identity pillars, 

82
00:06:10,176 --> 00:06:14,943
taglines, visual identity. So it looks like we don't have colors. 

83
00:06:14,943 --> 00:06:20,809
edit this document dynamically here to adding some colors that make sense for this 

84
00:06:20,809 --> 00:06:26,510
sort of organization. We've got a target audience personas, we've got social proof, 

85
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:31,743
differentiation, and we've got a little bit of existing information. 

86
00:06:31,943 --> 00:06:36,710
I think for the colors, we should just be able to go back to the logo, which already 

87
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:42,310
has some colors in it. Well, we'll just add that in there and say, can you extract 

88
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,410
branding colors 

89
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:45,477
from logo? 

90
00:06:45,477 --> 00:06:47,277
And we might also say, 

91
00:06:47,277 --> 00:06:51,010
I've also added a little bit. You can add more branding colors 

92
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:53,044
if you think it makes sense. 

93
00:06:53,044 --> 00:06:59,044
So we've got new colors being created. Now let's go and turn everything into a document. 

94
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:03,411
So I've just said, can you create brand details document using the recommended color 

95
00:07:03,411 --> 00:07:09,111
palette from the AI's point of view? Plus I'm just gonna paste in the rest of the 

96
00:07:09,111 --> 00:07:14,111
information that we had above. And this should turn it into a Canvas document. Start 

97
00:07:14,111 --> 00:07:18,811
writing everything. There's a little button at the top of this where I can press 

98
00:07:18,811 --> 00:07:23,044
copy and we'll just move it directly over to the file system. 

99
00:07:23,044 --> 00:07:28,678
So here's our document. We'll go and press copy, go back to Visual Studio in this 

100
00:07:28,678 --> 00:07:32,978
case, and we'll click on the brand details document and just paste everything in 

101
00:07:32,978 --> 00:07:33,678
and save it.

102
00:07:33,678 --> 00:07:38,011
So the last piece in the puzzle is to create a requirements document that we can 

103
00:07:38,011 --> 00:07:42,912
use. Now, we do need to be careful that whatever we create right now doesn't get 

104
00:07:43,112 --> 00:07:48,545
too influenced by the other two documents we've done. The role and the marketing 

105
00:07:48,545 --> 00:07:53,478
collateral, mainly because we have detailed information there, it's in this conversation, 

106
00:07:53,745 --> 00:07:58,212
but when we use it in another tool, I'll be using Claude Code, but it could be replit, 

107
00:07:58,445 --> 00:08:03,912
it could be cursor. They are already provided as tangible finished documents. 

108
00:08:03,912 --> 00:08:07,612
so what I've done is started a prompt that says, can you create a requirements document 

109
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:14,979
for me? The project is pure HTML and Tailwind CSS landing page. No JavaScript frameworks 

110
00:08:14,979 --> 00:08:20,813
or backend logic. Keep the tech minimal and focused. Now, I've also said this prompt 

111
00:08:20,813 --> 00:08:25,946
is being used in a separate chat bot and already has access to the two supporting 

112
00:08:25,946 --> 00:08:30,046
documents, which is the brand details and the persona document that we've just talked 

113
00:08:30,046 --> 00:08:35,413
about. You can let these documents inspire the structure, but don't integrate it. 

114
00:08:35,413 --> 00:08:39,213
So in this case, it's a little bit fuzzy. I would write this prompt a little bit 

115
00:08:39,213 --> 00:08:44,913
differently if I was going to do the actual vibe coding inside ChatGTP, but in this 

116
00:08:44,913 --> 00:08:46,680
case, I'm just preparing documents. 

117
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:51,680
I might also just take the original information that was right here and throw it 

118
00:08:51,680 --> 00:09:00,714
down the bottom. You can use this and we'll paste it in 
and let's see what sort of a requirements document it produces for us. 

119
00:09:00,714 --> 00:09:05,314
So we've got a detailed document with the project scope. The technology is listed. 

120
00:09:05,314 --> 00:09:09,580
It looks like the page is going to have a hero, which is the main image at the top 

121
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:14,714
of the website. We've got some features who, it's for compliance and intelligence 

122
00:09:14,714 --> 00:09:15,247
section. 

123
00:09:15,281 --> 00:09:19,814
this is for government sponsored programs. So this is important. We've got testimonials, 

124
00:09:20,047 --> 00:09:25,181
frequently asked questions, and a call to action and footer. We've got all the layout, 

125
00:09:25,214 --> 00:09:30,348
SEO media and assets. I think we've even got the location of the file. So a simple 

126
00:09:30,348 --> 00:09:34,814
HTML file with simple CSS and an assets folder. 

127
00:09:34,814 --> 00:09:39,315
So we'll just copy the information and we'll go down to our requirements document 

128
00:09:39,315 --> 00:09:40,981
and we'll paste everything in.

129
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:45,815
Now I plan to do a few versions of the landing page, and I'll do it from a few different 

130
00:09:45,848 --> 00:09:50,415
techniques. So we'll start off in regular Claude at the moment and put in a prompt 

131
00:09:50,415 --> 00:09:54,815
that says, can you become. Now what do we want to become? We want to become the persona 

132
00:09:54,815 --> 00:10:00,948
that we set up earlier. So if we go over and drag the persona into here and press 

133
00:10:00,982 --> 00:10:01,382
go, 

134
00:10:01,382 --> 00:10:06,549
it's loading in, the idea of what a marketing landing page designer really encompasses.

135
00:10:06,549 --> 00:10:12,849
Next we'll put in a simple prompt will go. Can you absorb branding design guidelines? 

136
00:10:12,982 --> 00:10:17,449
We're waiting for further instructions. We'll go back down to our files. This time. 

137
00:10:17,449 --> 00:10:19,682
We'll put in the brand details

138
00:10:19,682 --> 00:10:24,682
and we'll just let that come in. So now we've loaded up this clean conversation with 

139
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:29,849
two useful pieces of information. One is an employee of sorts, 

140
00:10:29,883 --> 00:10:34,949
a web designer, in this case. And we've loaded in all of the details around the brand.

141
00:10:34,949 --> 00:10:40,049
And the last prompt is, can you create a website using brand details that we've already 

142
00:10:40,049 --> 00:10:44,550
inputted and the following requirements. And we can just drag that information in 

143
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:49,816
and press go. And what it should start to do is create an artifact for us and start 

144
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:54,283
generating the code over on the right. One of the things that we can see here is 

145
00:10:54,283 --> 00:10:59,017
that we've got tailwind CSS. This actually might be a little bit problematic, because 

146
00:10:59,017 --> 00:11:05,050
I find this particular CDN implementation not to be the best. So we may need to change 

147
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:11,084
that. But at the moment it's just writing all the HTML. We need to do some sort of 

148
00:11:11,084 --> 00:11:15,984
visual landing page. And this will change every time you do it. So the good thing 

149
00:11:15,984 --> 00:11:20,884
about this technique is that you can run it multiple times, and I'll show you a better 

150
00:11:20,884 --> 00:11:25,417
way of doing that soon so that you can test different iterations.

151
00:11:25,417 --> 00:11:30,384
So it failed to create. And it's happened because of an uncaught reference error 

152
00:11:30,384 --> 00:11:35,684
to tailwind. I see this fairly regularly, and when I went to go into fix mode, it 

153
00:11:35,684 --> 00:11:41,018
just randomly did 6 or 7 tests. That all failed, and I had to give it a little bit 

154
00:11:41,018 --> 00:11:45,851
of instructions. And on the ninth one it did work. And so we've got this landing 

155
00:11:45,851 --> 00:11:52,051
page that's been created correctly. It's following the branding guidelines that it 

156
00:11:52,051 --> 00:11:53,751
assumed would be the right way to go. 

157
00:11:53,785 --> 00:11:58,485
I think we could play around with colors a fair bit, but let's test a couple more 

158
00:11:58,485 --> 00:12:02,752
ways of generating this same landing page with other tools.

159
00:12:02,752 --> 00:12:07,852
So to test out the next technique, we'll just go to a clean ChatGTP window and I'll 

160
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:12,252
say, I'll give you three documents. I want you to become the persona. I want you 

161
00:12:12,252 --> 00:12:16,585
to read and understand the brand details for the client. And lastly, I want you to 

162
00:12:16,585 --> 00:12:21,819
create a simple HTML page using the requirements I've also just said for reinforcement, 

163
00:12:21,852 --> 00:12:27,519
in other words, as persona rebrand details and create HTML following the requirements. 

164
00:12:27,752 --> 00:12:33,219
And if we pop on down to our file system before where we had these files, we should 

165
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:38,953
be able to just drag them in. Once they've loaded, we can just press go and hopefully 

166
00:12:38,953 --> 00:12:43,853
it'll start writing html and we'll be able to visualize it in ChatGTP. 

167
00:12:44,286 --> 00:12:49,920
So it started writing index html. Maybe it's something that we've gotta bring down 

168
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:57,220
to Visual Studio to edit and run from. One of the things I noticed high up is that 

169
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:03,153
we've got Tailwind CSS, but we don't actually have a link to it to A CDN. So this 

170
00:13:03,153 --> 00:13:07,920
wouldn't run the way it is right now. We also don't even have these icons, so things 

171
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,653
will be a little bit different when running it this way. And quite frankly, it's 

172
00:13:11,653 --> 00:13:15,687
a very small HTML file. So let's just see 

173
00:13:15,687 --> 00:13:22,387
what would happen if we just go into the edit mode. So from edit mode, we can actually 

174
00:13:22,454 --> 00:13:26,654
preview it. There's a little button up in the top right hand corner, and so we can 

175
00:13:26,654 --> 00:13:29,754
see that none of the CSS has come through for us. 

176
00:13:29,754 --> 00:13:31,887
So I'm just gonna test whether I can bring this 

177
00:13:31,887 --> 00:13:38,887
alignment and working directly from ChatGTP, I've just said, can you make this complete? 

178
00:13:38,921 --> 00:13:43,588
In other words, can you replace the asset icons that we had, which were images with 

179
00:13:43,588 --> 00:13:45,454
just scalable vetor graphics? 

180
00:13:45,454 --> 00:13:49,754
And can we make sure that the CSS is calling A CDN? 

181
00:13:49,754 --> 00:13:53,555
And we'll just run that. It'll rewrite the code for us. 

182
00:13:53,588 --> 00:13:57,788
We can see the scalable veto graphics being drawn here and here. I don't know what 

183
00:13:57,788 --> 00:14:01,721
shape they are, they're just a bunch of mathematical numbers from my point of view 

184
00:14:01,721 --> 00:14:02,655
at the moment. 

185
00:14:02,655 --> 00:14:09,322
Now, like in Claude, we had similar issues with the tailwind CSS showing up, so I 

186
00:14:09,322 --> 00:14:13,722
just gave it a screenshot and said what are the suggestions? Came up with a few. 

187
00:14:13,755 --> 00:14:18,355
I said, can you just use the recommended change and rewrote it for us? And what that 

188
00:14:18,355 --> 00:14:24,022
means is that if we hit play on this particular one, we now do have a working version 

189
00:14:24,022 --> 00:14:26,322
on the screen. It's a little bit different to the other. 

190
00:14:26,322 --> 00:14:31,422
But now let's go to the last technique, which I prefer to use over these two. 

191
00:14:31,422 --> 00:14:35,756
which is to use Claude Code. So I've come down to Visual Studio. We've got our three 

192
00:14:35,756 --> 00:14:40,656
files that we're interested in here, and I'm just going to open up a terminal. 

193
00:14:40,656 --> 00:14:46,056
with the terminal open, I can start typing Claude and this will open up, we can initialize 

194
00:14:46,056 --> 00:14:49,856
it, we can do options, but I'm just going to use it the way it is right now and start 

195
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:50,823
writing a prompt. 

196
00:14:50,989 --> 00:14:55,756
So I've just said, can you become, I'll put in the at symbol and I'll start writing 

197
00:14:55,756 --> 00:14:58,390
persona and that becomes available. 

198
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:03,556
Then I say using the brand details again. I put in the at sign, I start typing brand. 

199
00:15:03,556 --> 00:15:08,456
I've said create a HTML file called, we can put in anything we want. We can even 

200
00:15:08,456 --> 00:15:12,823
use the at symbol, even though it won't make a lot of sense 'cause it doesn't exist 

201
00:15:12,823 --> 00:15:17,790
right now. I'll do index one point HTML in this case. And the reason I'm doing the 

202
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:21,957
one is we should be able to create two, three, and four and see different look and 

203
00:15:21,957 --> 00:15:24,324
feel. And the last thing we should write here 

204
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:29,824
is follow the requirements. So at that point we can just start typing requirements. 

205
00:15:29,857 --> 00:15:33,590
There's the document and we press enter. And press go. 

206
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:38,457
So now it's reading all three files and coming up with a plan of action for what 

207
00:15:38,457 --> 00:15:43,624
it wants to do. It says I'll create a marketing landing page for support signal using 

208
00:15:43,624 --> 00:15:46,357
the brand details and the requirements provided. 

209
00:15:46,357 --> 00:15:50,891
And now it has a list of steps that it's going to work through. We've got creating 

210
00:15:50,891 --> 00:15:52,358
the HTML structure.

211
00:15:52,358 --> 00:15:57,991
So it's created the code. It's asking if I want to write it into the system. So we've 

212
00:15:57,991 --> 00:16:01,958
got this new file called index one html going on, 

213
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:03,658
and it says it's finished everything. 

214
00:16:03,658 --> 00:16:08,191
It's told us everything it's done. If we right click on the file and I've got live 

215
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:12,725
server available, so I can click on that button there and here we have it. 

216
00:16:12,725 --> 00:16:17,892
One of the things I find about Claude Code over the last two techniques that we used, 

217
00:16:17,892 --> 00:16:23,592
which was ChatGTP plus, and the Claude conversation window as well, is that this 

218
00:16:23,592 --> 00:16:28,659
tends to work every time and the quality of the output tends to be a lot better. 

219
00:16:28,792 --> 00:16:33,592
This is using the Opus model. In this particular case, we're on index number one. 

220
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:39,125
even things work. So I clicked on a button and we saw start your free trial. 

221
00:16:39,359 --> 00:16:45,192
Now for the next example, we'll create index two and we'll start typing in Claude 

222
00:16:45,192 --> 00:16:50,326
again. But this time I'm going to put in a model and I'm going to use the sonnet 

223
00:16:50,359 --> 00:16:57,493
model. So if we pop this up like this and kick it off, where still in Claude, we're 

224
00:16:57,493 --> 00:17:01,226
just doing it from a different location. And I'm gonna paste in a prompt that says, 

225
00:17:01,226 --> 00:17:06,360
can you become persona, the same brand details, the same requirements only? We're 

226
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:12,026
going to put it into index number two, so it's gonna go through the same thing all 

227
00:17:12,026 --> 00:17:12,526
over again. 

228
00:17:12,526 --> 00:17:18,593
Now as that happens, we'll have our visual studio coming up. We can see everything 

229
00:17:18,593 --> 00:17:23,593
running down in the bottom right hand corner. And hopefully a new file called index 

230
00:17:23,593 --> 00:17:29,893
two will get generated here. 
When we look at it in the terminal, it's got all similar stuff to before, but it 

231
00:17:29,893 --> 00:17:34,527
will change things around. We could have even used a little bit of a custom instruction 

232
00:17:34,794 --> 00:17:38,494
to do something fancy, and we might do that with the third example. 

233
00:17:38,494 --> 00:17:42,960
So it's got all the information. It started writing a new file, 

234
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:50,061
So I'll right click on the index two and we can open it up. And here we have it. 

235
00:17:50,127 --> 00:17:55,527
Now it looks very similar. If we go down the bottom, let's look at them side by side 

236
00:17:55,527 --> 00:17:59,061
here with the other version that we had 
slightly different 

237
00:17:59,061 --> 00:18:00,094
and we come back.

238
00:18:00,094 --> 00:18:06,228
So we'll right click and open up index two. And here it is. If we look at it compared 

239
00:18:06,228 --> 00:18:07,461
to index one 

240
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:12,495
it the same way. It's called from reactive reporting to reformative intelligence. 

241
00:18:12,561 --> 00:18:17,661
If we look down at FAQ in number two and we move down, we've got FAQ. Again, it's 

242
00:18:17,661 --> 00:18:22,962
slightly different and we've got a different way of doing the email sign up down 

243
00:18:22,962 --> 00:18:23,562
the bottom.

244
00:18:23,562 --> 00:18:28,595
So for our final test, we'll just do something a little bit different. I've got exactly 

245
00:18:28,595 --> 00:18:34,028
the same prompt in the same conversation. This time I've called it index three, which 

246
00:18:34,028 --> 00:18:39,562
makes sense, but I want to give it more of a Christmas feel. So I'll just say it's 

247
00:18:39,762 --> 00:18:45,362
Christmas. And we have decided that the landing page needs a Christmas feel. So let's 

248
00:18:45,362 --> 00:18:47,095
see what it does the third time.

249
00:18:47,095 --> 00:18:52,462
So it's got our to-dos. It's a little bit different because we're going to structure 

250
00:18:52,462 --> 00:18:54,629
it with festive elements. 

251
00:18:54,629 --> 00:18:59,496
We're also going to have brand colors plus the Christmas color accents. 

252
00:18:59,496 --> 00:19:03,763
Now if you're wondering how long this should take, I'm finding that it's taking somewhere 

253
00:19:03,763 --> 00:19:08,729
between two to three minutes to generate these pages. But it is a one shot, it gets 

254
00:19:08,729 --> 00:19:09,829
it right each time 

255
00:19:09,829 --> 00:19:14,163
So that's finished. We'll go over to Visual Studio. We've got a third file. When 

256
00:19:14,163 --> 00:19:18,296
we look through, we've got some colors and look at that. We're starting to see concepts 

257
00:19:18,296 --> 00:19:24,096
like animations. We've got Christmas reds. What happens if we go to the web on this? 

258
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:27,297
And it's still our brand colors, but we've now got 

259
00:19:27,297 --> 00:19:30,997
Christmas trees, we've got presents, we've got snowflakes, we've got some sort of 

260
00:19:30,997 --> 00:19:36,197
border going around. Let's see, and the color of all the panels have all changed 

261
00:19:36,197 --> 00:19:41,530
quite a bit. Now this was created from scratch, so normally you wouldn't do it this 

262
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:46,964
way. Normally you might say modify the existing structure to have the Christmas feel. 

263
00:19:46,964 --> 00:19:49,430
But this has worked pretty well. I love this.

264
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:55,964
So to recap, we essentially used three prompts. We had the agent definition role. 

265
00:19:55,964 --> 00:20:01,897
So who was going to be building the website for us. We then had our marketing collateral, 

266
00:20:01,964 --> 00:20:06,364
our branding information, our second brain. And that could be any information that 

267
00:20:06,364 --> 00:20:11,631
you want to see going into the website. And lastly, we did the requirements. We tested 

268
00:20:11,631 --> 00:20:18,365
it on Claude OpenAI, ChatGPT plus and Claude Code,. And with the Claude Code,, we 

269
00:20:18,398 --> 00:20:22,598
were able to do three different variations, including a Christmas version.

270
00:20:22,598 --> 00:20:27,098
Now if you're interested in working one on one with me with Vibe coding, you can 

271
00:20:27,098 --> 00:20:31,998
come and book a call through that. We can arrange some time to work together, but 

272
00:20:31,998 --> 00:20:37,065
otherwise, if you just want to learn more about vibe coding and using Prompt Engineering
