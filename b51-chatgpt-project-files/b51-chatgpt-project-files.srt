00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:05,790
In this video, we're testing out what happens when you load too many files into a 

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:11,960
ChatGPT plus project folder. And this came about for me this morning because I'd 

3
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:17,80
loaded up all these files and I got this message saying responses may be of lower 

4
00:00:17,80 --> 00:00:22,510
quality due to the number of files used in the project. And I thought, can I work 

5
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:27,560
with this and give it information so it uses the correct files? And that's what we're 

6
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,480
testing today.

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:34,300
So for context, I have this project called 555 brand. Dave and I have a bunch of 

8
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:39,740
conversations around how I do my marketing, my branding, my mission statements, that 

9
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:46,20
sort of information. Now, I also follow a structured program from DENT international. 

10
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:50,540
This is Daniel Priestley and the key person of influence. And I'm in the startup 

11
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:56,100
accelerator program. And this morning I was doing one of the workshop lessons, and 

12
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,420
I ended up having all these files that I thought, I need to get this into ChatGPT. 

13
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:05,260
So I just loaded them. And the trouble is that we're seeing that message that says 

14
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,140
lower quality responses.

15
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:12,430
So what I did was I quickly went into another chat window and I just asked the question 

16
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:18,760
using the project files that are available in ChatGPT plus, can I deal with the fact 

17
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:23,920
that there's a message like this? What do we do to mitigate it? And it's given me 

18
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:29,950
the idea that if I actually specify the name of the file, I should be able to get 

19
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:35,290
it to use that effectively. So that will be our starting point. But what I think 

20
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:39,910
I'll also do while we're here is write a couple of prompts so that we can get this 

21
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:44,800
more into the custom instructions. 'cause when you're working with projects, you've 

22
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,700
got this area called instructions and I've already got instructions in here about 

23
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:54,400
my brand. But what would be useful is that if I already had a list of the files that 

24
00:01:54,400 --> 00:02:01,180
are available and a little bit of metadata or instructional data about when it should 

25
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:06,280
pick these particular files. So we will continue with some prompt engineering over 

26
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,500
here and we will test it over here.

27
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:13,850
Now what I've done at the moment is set up a little prompt designed to iterate over 

28
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:18,380
the 11 files I've got. I think that numbers are relevant really, but the fact that 

29
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:24,200
there are PDF documents is true and we're trying to describe the main purpose. Now, 

30
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:30,170
I was specific not to make this a synopsis. It's not about getting the summary of 

31
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:33,440
the document, but getting it in a specific format. 

32
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:38,10
And that format is known as a functional summary or retrieval guide. And the reason 

33
00:02:38,10 --> 00:02:42,840
for this is that we don't want to just know what's in the files, but we want to know 

34
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:48,660
when it would be useful to pick those particular files. So what I'm gonna do is select 

35
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:53,820
everything that's here and we will come over to our little document here and let's 

36
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,470
just test what happens. 

37
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:00,780
Let's just run this and see whether it can iterate through the PDF documents 

38
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:06,170
and write a functional summary for each particular file. So the first one, it's only 

39
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:11,710
done one of the files, so I think we might need to specifically state each file as 

40
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:16,460
we go. But the good thing about building this information is that we should be able 

41
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:20,600
to use it to create our customer instruction a bit later on.

42
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,300
Now I've just noticed that the bottom that it's suggesting that it can move on to 

43
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:29,580
the next file. So we're just going to run that. And it looks like we can just iterate 

44
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,340
through these one at a time. 

45
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:37,100
Let's look at this document here DENT value canvas. So a structured worksheet for 

46
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:43,660
articulating a value proposition by mapping pain points to emotional drivers. Now 

47
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:48,140
I was working on this particular document this morning. So that all makes sense.

48
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:53,400
And so we have a guideline of what it does how it helps people. But more importantly 

49
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,640
from the retrieval point of view, it tells us when to use this particular document.

50
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:02,130
So I've just gone through and done all 11 documents and they were pretty easy. All 

51
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:06,900
I had to do was press yes. Each time it would tell me the next file it was going 

52
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:11,820
to do. And that's what it's done here. DENT Origin Mission, we've got what the document 

53
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:16,770
is about and when you would use it. And as I was moving through, this was all working 

54
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:24,30
perfectly. I did get to a specific file of one of the people that is already a member 

55
00:04:24,30 --> 00:04:29,910
of the DENT program. This, her name is Colette. And I thought, this can't be written 

56
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:34,440
that way 'cause I don't necessarily want to use this as a source of truth. This is 

57
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,770
more an example. So I just made a simple statement 

58
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:42,800
that it should go back to this version and mention that it's one of the members 

59
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:46,750
and not a specific instruction from DENT. And this is great because it's come up 

60
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,760
with when you would use it. 

61
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:53,510
so it's come up with the fact that it's for a high impact person. This is actually 

62
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:59,00
a really good example, but it is only an example being described. The last one that 

63
00:04:59,00 --> 00:05:05,300
was also important was that I'd done a bunch of deep research using open ai. And 

64
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:09,890
that particular document is really good. It's really comprehensive, but it's not 

65
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:12,410
the direct instructions as per DENT. 

66
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:17,610
so I also ensured that when I asked it to process it, I gave it extra information 

67
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:20,40
to let it know when to use it. 

68
00:05:20,50 --> 00:05:24,810
And we can see here that it will be used if I'm ever working on my pricing structures, 

69
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:25,920
which is actually how I 

70
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,10
used it manually a couple of days ago. 

71
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,310
but also 

72
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:34,200
that it's not authored by DENT directly. It serves as a complimentary resource.

73
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,660
Now I've put together a prompt that will help us prepare the custom instruction. 

74
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:44,10
It's going to go through the PDF documents, describe when to use them. Keep a summarized 

75
00:05:44,10 --> 00:05:49,460
brief. We need a brief, but it needs to be quite small and emphasizes the retrieval 

76
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:54,660
relevance. So I'm going to take this information as we see it here. We'll come back 

77
00:05:54,660 --> 00:06:00,460
to our main conversation. Everything is here. But I will actually paste in the exact 

78
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,900
values. So if we just come down here and say

79
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:04,640
use

80
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,650
the following, something like that.

81
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:12,550
And the reason I'm doing that is because I've made changes as I was doing the conversation. 

82
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:17,310
So I don't want it to use the past. So we'll come down here, we'll press enter and 

83
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:20,990
we paste in all this information and let's see what happens.

84
00:06:21,00 --> 00:06:27,900
And here we have the custom assistant instruction DENT project file index. And this 

85
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:32,580
is looking great. We've got all the files listed. Look at this. It said this one's 

86
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:38,100
not from DENT. Use it for pricing model comparison which is great.

87
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:38,780
and we've got 

88
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:43,140
as not a DENT template but a real person example. 

89
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:46,810
So what we should be able to do is take all the information from here. 

90
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:52,330
if we go back to the project, we can click on the custom instructions and we'll just 

91
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:53,770
pop down to the bottom.

92
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:57,870
We'll just go up to here and paste all that information in hit save.

93
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:03,310
So let's test this out. I'm just going to copy a few words from one of them. This 

94
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:10,930
is Ideal Client Profiles. We'll head over to a new chat and I'll say, can you create, 

95
00:07:11,20 --> 00:07:15,370
and we'll just paste that information in using the following, 

96
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:22,440
information. And the information can come from my brand, information from my mission, 

97
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:23,250
and 

98
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,570
maybe my content, 

99
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:27,300
maybe the pillars that I work with. 

100
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,670
And now it's just a case of paste in a mission, paste in some pillars. So I'll come 

101
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:36,500
over to this document here. We've got a little bit of a mission going on. We'll copy 

102
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,150
that down and paste it in. 

103
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,590
we'll come down and let's look at the system. I use it's scale framework. I can either 

104
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:47,690
do the short version or the long version. I'll go with the short version. And we 

105
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:51,680
can already see that that's part of my mission anyway. But now we have a bit more 

106
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,810
of a definition to it and we'll just run this. And hopefully what it's going to do 

107
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,810
is look within a particular document. 

108
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:04,580
And it certainly has, I'm pretty impressed already 'cause I, I've been working through, 

109
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:09,980
this tutorial on this at the moment. So we've got ideal client profile, AI driven 

110
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:14,900
creator. That's the sort of person that I'm marketing to because what I do is I create 

111
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:20,390
AI workflows specifically for content creators, very much like myself. And that's 

112
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:25,610
what it's saying, creative systems thinkers, aspiring YouTubers, creators, 

113
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:29,110
solo content teams. So the client profile looks good, 

114
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:34,190
the core pain points look good, the deep fear and the desired outcome. And it also 

115
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:38,690
mentions my signature method. And one of the things to note is that I never use the 

116
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,10
term signature method. 

117
00:08:40,10 --> 00:08:46,250
I know that that comes from DENT International, so I'm already really happy with 

118
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:46,610
this. 

119
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:52,140
So that was just a little quick walkthrough on how you can improve your interaction 

120
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:57,500
with ChatGPT files, especially when you've got a lot of them. What we did was essentially 

121
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:02,540
just take a go through them and build up a custom instruction, put it into the custom 

122
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:07,780
instructions area so that when we're communicating with our project, it can pick 

123
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:12,900
the right files automatically. Anyway, I'm AppyDave. Please like and subscribe. And
