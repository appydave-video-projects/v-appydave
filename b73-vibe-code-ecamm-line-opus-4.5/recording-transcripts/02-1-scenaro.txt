Now that last segment I just created is sitting in this video and we'll just do a rename to
move it over.
Now not every progression that I talk about in this video we'll see here, but keep in
mind that all I'm doing behind the scenes is I'm either using one of my stream decks
to change scenes like I did just then, I'm using the Elgato pedal down below, I'm using
my stream deck pedal so I can do things like change my wardrobe mid recording, I'm using
a stream deck pedal down at my feet so I can change my wardrobe mid recording.
In fact someone who I work with in Tupelo, Arizona, or maybe what I want to do is bring
in a product to showcase, and I was recently in Tapello, Mississippi, and I was recently
in Tapello, Mississippi where I got this mug such as showing this water flask from
Tapello, Mississippi, such as showing this Elvis Presley water jug.
And all of this is achievable using a couple of stream decks, a stream deck pedal, the
wonderful software that is Ecamm Live, and this little application that I Vibe coded,
and the little application, and this application that I Vibe coded using, and this little application
that I Vibe coded using Opus 4.5 from Anthropic.
