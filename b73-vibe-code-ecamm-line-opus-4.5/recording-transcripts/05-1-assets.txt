so I've just finished that so we can see it updated and we're about to go on to
assets but before we do that let's just set ourselves up with a new chapter we'll
call it assets ahead of time so when I hit save on this this is where it's
going to go but let's talk about what it is so firstly we've got this set of
controls so I'll make sense in a moment and then under it we've got incoming
images and just below my head at the moment is also assets so currently we've
got our asset assignment and this is where we can label things correctly
we've got our incoming images and that's in the downloads directory I'll just
click on that button right now and we can see that it's popping up here and
there's nothing in there at the moment we haven't downloaded anything and we
do want to get our assets from the downloads directory over to our video
and the last area we've got is where the assets get assigned to now what is an
asset what I'll do is I'm just going to go over to a chat GPT window and this is
from another video and I've got a bunch of assets that have been generated using
just prompt engineering and a style guide and we'll just pick the bottom one
so we'll click on it and we'll press this little download button right here
and if we go down to our downloads directory or in this case finder we can
see that the image has just gone into this particular location now I didn't
generate this image for this video but let's say it was meant to work with the
04 to open finder now I didn't produce this image for this video but let's say
it was meant to work with the 04-1 opening finder what I can do is come
over to our web application what I can do is come over to our application it's
now automatically shown in the incoming images area it's got a time stamp of
midday it's currently two minutes past midday and the reason I put pauses in
in this particular case was a plane flew over my house and so I had to pause the
video by pressing the right foot pedal but what I want to do now is come up to
our asset control and say let's assign it to one of the videos now and we'll do
the last one which is number 2 open in finder but what we might do is just go
up to number 1 now I can control things from different locations I could say
it's part of chapter 3 instead and it'll do that chapter 2 or I can just go to
the end I can also do variations the reason I want variations is sometimes I
want to have more than one image that I'll let the video editor decide which
image to use and this is where I'll do A's and B's and what's going on here is
whatever I type in here we'll say Abby Dave the variation will put in there so
there's a variation if there's no variation then it'll just be a sequential
number and where's it related to chapter 4 sequence sequence 1 in the video now
I have other capabilities now I have other capabilities here I'll show you
there's a hover effect and we can make it small medium or large like that but
the only thing we really want to do is come up and press this assign button and
we're expecting the video to move out of the downloads folder and somewhere in
here and whatever location it goes into that should be the name so I'm going to
press assign and it's disappeared from the download we now have this new folder
called assets we'll click in there we've got one called images we'll click in
there and there's that image now I may not want to waste my time during the
recording of the video of doing the images I might instead just want to come
up with a prompt for an image and ask my video editor if he could generate the
image so I'm going to use a product right now called ito AI there is a link
in the there is a link to a video on this product on my channel but so what
I'm about to do is use ito AI now I do have a link to a video on what is an
awesome tool and another one of those productivity enhancements but what we're
going to do is write a prompt here and I'm going to I'm going to say can you
do some sort of infographic can you do this could you do some sort of
infographic about the quick brown fox jumping over the lazy dog we'll let that
go and what I'll do is it's just written that information into the text box now
when I press save here we still get a file but it's not a PNG this time it's
just the text that was actually in the prompt and that text is actually
recorded in the assigned assets so we've got a section down the bottom here
where we can see that we've got the 041 opening finder with an image we've also
got an 041 opening finder with an actual prompt and if I take that prompt now
I've just asked chat GPT to look at my previous infographics for style
guidelines rather than trying to come up with a prompt directly and I've just
taken that information and it's come up with some options for me I don't know
what this is looks good so we're just gonna see what it does when it creates
an image so it's generating some sort of infographic at the moment so it's
generating some sort of infographic at the moment and a few minutes later here
we have our infographic now it looks beautiful there's obviously some typos
going on in this but what we want to do is get it into the incoming images right
here so I'm just going to press the little download button right there and
in a moment it should just automatically appear it's just automatically appeared
that's great now I'm currently pretending that I'm the video editor
because he would have done the image himself using this text then what he can
do is click on this and that just resets to the correct location we've got the
opening finder notice it's saying image number three it's because it already
understands that there's a 1.png and a 2.appydavetext what I might do is I
might just leave it that way and say I might just leave it that way and do an
assign on it it should currently be in the assets folder if we want to make it
bigger we can either do it by pressing this or we can also do a hover effect
with the hover effect we see the size of the file the date and time and when we
head down to our folder we've got that new image now let's move on to the next
step and that's dealing with thumbnails for your video so I was able to vibe
code this little thumbnail section and currently there is a zip file there
we'll just delete that I don't think we need it and we'll come over to the
incoming I'm going to hit stop on this video which is all about the assets
