Now at the moment on my Ecamm Live downloads directory I have two video recordings in place,
they're both quite big and the one that we had earlier for 122 megabytes is not really
part of the intro of this video but it's more of a scenario.
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to come up here and create a new chapter, it's going
to automatically become chapter 2 and it's going to reset the sequence to number 1.
Now I don't have any predefined areas called scenario because if I click on that this will
just fill it in but I can type in whatever I want so we'll type in the word scenario
here, bring up our folder structure and we'll just do a rename of that and it moves over.
Now it asks me do I want to delete remaining files and in this particular case I want to
say no, normally I would have a few bad tates, I want to get rid of them but this particular
file here is also part of the same scenario so I'm just going to press rename one more
time and so now I've got two videos in chapter 2 on scenario already recorded.
Now what I'd like to do is maybe do a little bit of vibe coding right now just to fix a
little problem.
So I'm just going to hit save.
