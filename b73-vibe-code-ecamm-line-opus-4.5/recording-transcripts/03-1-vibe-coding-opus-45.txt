restart the video and show that this part is also part of the scenario so in
theory I could do a rename but what I'd like to know is how long is that in
seconds. Now to make the modification to this using Vibe coding I'm using a tool
called Claude code so what I've done is just gone down to the base folder on my
computer where this application is running and I'm just going to type in
Claude and in my case I'm going to turn on the dangerously skip permissions
which means it has full control of my system if it wants it and I'm just gonna
ask it a simple question what are we doing here in this folder and you can
see that it's got a couple of folders and these folders are nearly two years
old of this particular application in its earlier form and I used the
requirements that were in there the other day to build the application we're
about to see so I'm now asking it what is going on in the file name of folder
and you can see here that it's some sort of React and Node.js application that's
been built it's watching the Ecamm live directory now this could be configured
for something like OBS if that's the streaming software you're using then
there's this idea of dealing with thumbnail images for my videos images
for b-rolls so when I did this symbol so when I pointed to the screen here
what was happening was an image was generated and it was just going to get
put into that particular location but for now what I think we want to do is go
and change the little capability but for now but for now what I want to do is
come back to this and put in a little capability into the application so if we
come over to this little
