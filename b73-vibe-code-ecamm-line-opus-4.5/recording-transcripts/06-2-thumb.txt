So, what we'll do is come back to our incoming area, make sure we're on our recordings, we'll
just do a rename of that, so this is number six thumb, we can also go back to our recordings
right here.
Now, I don't currently have a restore all, but I can restore them one at a time, so we'll
click on that one, that one and that one, finally we'll do this one, this one and this
one and our safe directory is now empty, I could delete it manually.
