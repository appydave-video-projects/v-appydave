then we restart the video and we can see that there is a holding file going on
right now. We can go to the project directory, we can also go to the
downloads directory. Now the downloads directory won't make any sense until we
get to assets, this is where we can attach images to our videos, but what we'll do
is get this little ecamm live file over to our main application. Now we're not
on the demonstration of Opus 4.5 so what we'll do is we'll just create a new
chapter and we'll call this section the open in finder. Now one of the uses of
labeling my videos this way is that I use the large language model to help me
automatically generate the chapter links in the YouTube description. So when you
go down and look at this video from a YouTube description point of view you're
going to see you're going to see links that are based on the context of the
transcript but also around whatever this name is. Now that said let's just
do a rename we know it's 2 minutes and 50 seconds we know it's 2 minutes 57
seconds which is that new capability we know it's 68 megabytes we'll hit rename
and it's just moved over for us. So we'll come back to our recordings and we'll
turn off the safe because I don't really care about that this is where we're up
to in our video.
