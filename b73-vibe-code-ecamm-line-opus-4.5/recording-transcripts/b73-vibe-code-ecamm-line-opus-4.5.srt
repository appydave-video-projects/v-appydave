00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:05,200
Have you been hearing about Vibe coding and wondered, could you build an application 

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,350
for yourself? In this video, I'm just demonstrating an application that I built this 

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:16,230
week using Claude Opus 4.5. What it allows me to do is double the productivity with 

4
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:21,190
my own recording schedule as a YouTuber. It's allowing me to do short segment

5
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:26,390
recordings, put them directly into a folder, and named correctly. I can then add 

6
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:31,160
images directly and have the images labeled to match the recording that they're part 

7
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:36,240
of. I can also create thumbnails and add them against the video recording, and then 

8
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,550
at any time change to a different project.

9
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:42,210
Now, let me give you a little bit of context. We are looking at the application. 

10
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,920
There's a bunch of what are considered bad takes, which are all the white area and 

11
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,950
potential good takes in yellow, and what is probably the good take in green. And 

12
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:58,830
I'm using ECammLive. So what's good about using ECammLive is I can press buttons 

13
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:04,320
on my stream deck and I can go to pre-configured scenes. So if we wanted to look 

14
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,180
at the coding that's over here on this monitor right here, I can press this button. 

15
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:15,120
There's a coding going on. If I'm having conversations with a requirements document 

16
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,680
that's building the application, I can look here. 

17
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,990
Now another thing that I've got going on is I've got a little strand deck pedal. 

18
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:25,590
Now if I press the right pedal right now, 

19
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:31,980
I can pause the video long enough to reset up the scene with a prop as I've done. 

20
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,260
And if I press the button one more time, 

21
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,380
I could put the prop back on the shelf. 

22
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:44,370
Now another thing I could do is use my voice to create an image prompt and then have 

23
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,650
that image put right here. 

24
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:51,30
And the way this is happening is through the software that I've built that helps 

25
00:01:51,30 --> 00:01:53,100
me automate these workflows.

26
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:58,420
this little application that I've vibe coded using Opus 4.5 from Anthropic.

27
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:03,420
So let's go through what this application can do and maybe along the way fix a few 

28
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:08,190
things. And I think the first thing we need to fix is that the last recording that 

29
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:15,370
you just saw me doing is 122 megabytes in length and it's actually got a lot of errors 

30
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:20,880
in it. I was pausing, re-recording, pausing, re-recording, and that's not a normal 

31
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:25,300
workflow for me. I don't like having to do that because I really don't like doing 

32
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:30,810
video editing. I like to solve the problems in pre-production, not in post-production. 

33
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:33,90
And this is where e ECammLive has been 

34
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:37,680
such a beneficial piece of software. If I want to change my scenes, like to this 

35
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,960
one, I just go down to the stream deck, I press it. I want to go back to the scene 

36
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:47,400
that we were just looking at. It's really quick. You're seeing animations. There's 

37
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,840
absolutely no editing going on in this. 

38
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,400
But where ECammLive falls down for me is 

39
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:59,350
when it saves a file to the hard drive, it does it as a date timestamp. Now what 

40
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:03,870
I really want to do is put it into a chapter. Maybe I'm recording the introduction. 

41
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:09,250
So that's chapter one. And maybe there's going to be a few parts to the introduction. 

42
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:14,530
Maybe there's a scenario, a call to action or hook, anything like that. And I wanna 

43
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:20,110
make sure that every time I do a recording, not only does the file name change automatically, 

44
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:24,730
but it also goes into the correct project. It would be really good if I could record 

45
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,560
two different videos at once 

46
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,330
and quickly just switch from project to project by going to a bundle light projects 

47
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:35,980
and going, we are now working on this particular video, or we're back at this particular 

48
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:36,750
video. 

49
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:41,580
And so that's why I created this software. And now the actual requirements document 

50
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,400
for building it is nearly two years old, 

51
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:49,860
But recently I did a video and you can find out more about that right here. And that 

52
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,630
video is about how I used Opus 4.5 for the first time 

53
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:58,290
to build the initial part of this application that you've been looking at.

54
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:04,350
Now at the moment, on my e ECammLive downloads directory, I have two video recordings 

55
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:10,20
in place. They're both quite big and the one that we had earlier for 122 megabytes 

56
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,330
is not really part of the intro of this video, but it's more a scenario. So what 

57
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:19,410
I'm going to do is I'm going to come up here and create a new chapter. It's going 

58
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:23,970
to automatically become chapter two, and it's gonna reset the sequence to number 

59
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:24,270
one. 

60
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:29,220
Now I don't have any predefined areas called Scenario 'cause if I click on that, 

61
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,820
this will just fill it in. But I can type in whatever I want. 

62
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:37,320
So we'll type in the word scenario here, bring up our folder structure, and we'll 

63
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:42,670
just do a rename of that and it moves over. Now it asked me do I want to delete remaining 

64
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:47,620
files? And in this particular case, I wanna say no. Normally I would have a few bad 

65
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:52,180
tapes. I want to get rid of them, but this particular file here is also part of the 

66
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:56,50
same scenario. So I'm just going to press rename one more time. 

67
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:02,430
And so now I've got two videos in chapter two on scenario already recorded. Now what 

68
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:06,930
I'd like to do is maybe do a little bit of vibe coding right now just to fix a little 

69
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:09,90
problem. So I'm just gonna hit save.

70
00:05:09,90 --> 00:05:14,400
And restart the video and show that this part is also part of the scenario. So in 

71
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,860
theory, I could do a rename, but what I'd like to know is how long is that in seconds. 

72
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:25,620
Now to make the modification to this using Vibe coding, I'm using a tool called Claude 

73
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:31,290
Code. So what I've done is just gone down to the base folder on my computer where 

74
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:36,630
this application is running, and I'm just going to type in Claude. And in my case, 

75
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:41,310
I'm going turn on the -dangerously-skipped-permissions, which means it has full control 

76
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,990
of my system if it wants it. 

77
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:47,850
And I'm just gonna ask it a simple question, what are we doing here in this folder? 

78
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:53,70
And you can see that it's got a couple of folders. And these folders are nearly two 

79
00:05:53,70 --> 00:06:00,210
years old of this particular application in its earlier form. And I used the requirements 

80
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:03,810
that were in there the other day to build the application we're about to see. So 

81
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:08,100
I'm now asking it what is going on in the file-namer folder. 

82
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:13,200
And you can see here that it's some sort of React, node js application that's being 

83
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:18,480
built. It's watching the e ECammLive directory. Now this could be configured for 

84
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,230
something like OBS if that's the streaming software you are using. 

85
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:27,660
then there's this idea of dealing with thumbnail images for my videos, images for 

86
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,200
B roll. 

87
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:33,330
so when I pointed to the screen here, what was happening was an image was generated 

88
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:36,420
and it was just going to get put into that particular location. 

89
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:40,920
So I currently have three different terminals running The bottom terminal is the 

90
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,30
actual application. 

91
00:06:42,30 --> 00:06:47,500
so it's running and it's listening to the ECammLive directory and just sending information 

92
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:53,700
directly to the website. In here, this is my software architect or my product owner 

93
00:06:54,00 --> 00:06:54,870
conversation. 

94
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,280
this is where I'm building functional requirements or non-functional requirements. 

95
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:04,440
The difference is, is it visible and is it something that the user does, or is it 

96
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,40
something under the system like maybe communicating with a server. 

97
00:07:08,40 --> 00:07:12,250
and I recently asked it to create this functional requirement, which is, can you 

98
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:17,140
tell me how many seconds the video's actually going for? And what it did was write 

99
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:21,880
all this information in green. I don't tend to read it. I know this is working very 

100
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:27,370
effectively and it's created a non-functional requirement, number seven for us. And 

101
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:31,960
it's asking, do I want to hand this over to the developer? So I'm just going to say 

102
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:36,940
yes. And all it's doing at the moment is creating for me a little instruction set 

103
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:42,10
that includes the non-functional requirement it just wrote, and an instruction to 

104
00:07:42,10 --> 00:07:44,470
put it into a different conversation window. 

105
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:48,820
So it's finished writing that instruction. And what I can do is just select all the 

106
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:54,340
information down to the bottom, put it into my clipboard, and I just head over to 

107
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:59,140
the second conversation I've got going on in this system. And this is the developer. 

108
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:04,420
So all the requirements are done in the other conversation. This particular conversation 

109
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:09,730
is showing the developer. And so the developer is off writing code. We can see them 

110
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:11,470
side by side if we want to. 

111
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:17,200
I could even come over to the functional requirements area and start preparing the 

112
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,700
next bit of work to be done. 

113
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:23,110
but the main thing that I'm work hoping for is that when it gets to this area of 

114
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:28,750
updating the file card, it'll come over and will automatically see a new time sitting 

115
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,30
right next to this 71 megabytes. 

116
00:08:31,30 --> 00:08:35,650
We can see that the last section where I was making all these changes actually took 

117
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:36,430
four minutes. 

118
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:40,360
Now you might be thinking that's not how long the video is on YouTube. And that's 

119
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,910
because I will do some post editing 

120
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:47,920
because not every bad take I do, I stop the video if I've already got a really good 

121
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,940
starting part to that section and then I have a bad take, 

122
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:57,40
all I do is use my right foot to pause the video, compose myself, 

123
00:08:57,40 --> 00:08:58,510
and then record the next part. 

124
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:03,430
Now let's integrate these two into the main video. So this is a new chapter, so we're 

125
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:07,660
gonna go number three. We're on sequence one, and what we've been doing 

126
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:14,260
is vibe coding using Opus 4.5. So I'll just press rename on this particular one. 

127
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:19,690
That'll be number one. We will not discard and we will do another rename. And so 

128
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:24,250
both of those sections are now into my main video recording project. 

129
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:28,900
Now I did mention that a lot of files were also discarded, so were they deleted? 

130
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:33,730
And the answer is no. So one of the things going on in my video project is I do have 

131
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:38,650
a backup in the trash can of all the recordings that I said I didn't want, just in 

132
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:40,480
case I do want to go back and use 'em. 

133
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,800
But another thing that happens once you are recording a number of videos is that 

134
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,670
the list of current files here starts to get a little bit long. 

135
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:53,350
So let's start working through the capabilities that are in the recordings area. 

136
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:57,760
So what the recordings area is showing is the same videos that we were just looking 

137
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,860
at. If we press the folder button, we can see them right here. And we also have this 

138
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:07,30
little toggle called safe. And at the moment that's not doing anything because nothing 

139
00:10:07,30 --> 00:10:12,220
has been marked as safe. But what we could do is take the intro because I don't really 

140
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:17,980
need to refer to it anymore, and we'll just say Safe. And what that's done is moved 

141
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,90
it into a new fold 

142
00:10:19,90 --> 00:10:23,440
right here. And if we click on that, we'll see that the three intros are living in 

143
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,450
this position. Now, if we want to do 

144
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:30,10
the same thing for chapter two, which is the scenario, we can press that button there 

145
00:10:30,10 --> 00:10:30,520
as well. 

146
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,670
I've also put some quality of life features into the application. 

147
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:36,670
what this will do when I click on it is open finder 

148
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:40,990
and it's opened a second one for us, but it's opened it right where the recordings 

149
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:41,290
are. 

150
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:45,400
And I have this capability throughout the system. So if we go to the configuration, 

151
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,560
we can see where the ECamm files are. 

152
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:51,340
So they would get saved into here. In fact, let's stop the video.

153
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:56,170
And then we restart the video and we can see that there is a holding file going on 

154
00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:01,240
right now. We can go to the project directory. We can also go to the downloads directory. 

155
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,830
Now the downloads directory won't make any sense until we get to assets. This is 

156
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:10,30
where we can attach images to our videos, but what we'll do is 

157
00:11:10,30 --> 00:11:15,340
get this little ECammLive file over to our main application. Now we're not on the 

158
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:20,440
demonstration of Opus 4.5, so what we'll do is we'll just create a new chapter 

159
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:25,510
and we'll call this section the opening finder. Now, one of the uses of labeling 

160
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:31,270
my videos this way is that I use large language model to help me automatically generate 

161
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:35,500
the chapter links in the YouTube description. So when you go down and look at this 

162
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,900
video from a YouTube description point of view, 

163
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:43,90
you're going to see links that are based on the context of the transcript, but also 

164
00:11:43,90 --> 00:11:44,680
around whatever this name is. 

165
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:49,120
We know it's two minutes, 57 seconds, which is that new capability. We know it's 

166
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,560
68 megabytes. We'll hit rename and it's just moved over for us. 

167
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:58,450
So we'll come back to our recordings and we'll turn off the safe because I don't 

168
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:01,390
really care about that. This is where we're up to in our video.

169
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:04,390
So I've just finished that so we can see it updated 

170
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,90
and we're about to go onto assets. 

171
00:12:07,90 --> 00:12:12,520
So currently we've got our asset assignment, and this is where we can label things 

172
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:17,20
correctly. We've got our incoming images and that's in the downloads directory. I'll 

173
00:12:17,20 --> 00:12:18,700
just click on that button right now 

174
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:23,650
and we can see that it's popping up here and there's nothing in there at the moment. 

175
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:27,880
We haven't downloaded anything. And we do want to get our assets from the downloads 

176
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,780
directory over to our video. And the last area we've got 

177
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:34,150
is where the assets get assigned to. 

178
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:38,680
I'm just gonna go over to a chat GPT window. And this is from another video and I've 

179
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:44,20
got a bunch of assets that have been generated using just prompt engineering and 

180
00:12:44,20 --> 00:12:47,710
a style guide. And we'll just pick the bottom one. So we'll click on it and we'll 

181
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:49,870
press this little download button right here. 

182
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:55,120
And if we go down to our downloads directory, or in this case finder, we can see 

183
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,630
that the image has just gone into this particular location. 

184
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:02,470
Now, I didn't produce this image for this video, but let's say it was meant to work 

185
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:05,650
with the oh four dash one open in finder. 

186
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:10,930
What I can do is come over to our application. It's now automatically shown in the 

187
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:12,820
incoming images area. 

188
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:17,500
come up to our asset control and say, let's assign it to one of the videos. 

189
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,760
Now I can control things from different locations. I could say it's part of chapter 

190
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,710
three instead, and it'll do that chapter two, or I can just go to the end. 

191
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:31,390
there's a hover effect and we can make it small, medium, or large 

192
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:36,580
But the only thing we really want to do is come up and press this assign button. 

193
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:41,80
And we're expecting the video to move out of the downloads folder 

194
00:13:41,80 --> 00:13:45,700
and whatever location it goes into, that should be the name. So I'm going to press 

195
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,580
assign and it's disappeared from the download. 

196
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:51,910
called images. We'll click in there and there's that image. 

197
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:56,710
Now, I may not wanna waste my time during the recording of the video of doing the 

198
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:57,430
images. 

199
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:02,410
I might instead just want to come up with a prompt for an image and ask my video 

200
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:04,630
editor if he could generate the image. 

201
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:10,00
so what I'm about to dois use Ito.AI. Now I do have a link to a video on what is 

202
00:14:10,00 --> 00:14:14,20
an awesome tool and another one of those productivity enhancements. But what we're 

203
00:14:14,20 --> 00:14:15,760
gonna do is write a prompt here. 

204
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:21,880
could you do some sort of infographic about the quick brown fox jumping over the 

205
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,690
lazy dog? 

206
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:27,610
it's just written that information into the text box. Now when I press save here, 

207
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:33,730
we still get a file, but it's not a .png this time. It's just the text that was actually 

208
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:34,600
in the prompt. 

209
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:39,430
And that text is actually recorded in the assigned assets. So we've got a section 

210
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:40,330
down the bottom here 

211
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:44,650
We've also got an oh four one opening finder with a natural prompt. 

212
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:50,410
I've just asked chat GPT to look at my previous infographics for style guidelines 

213
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:53,410
So it's generating some sort of infographic at the moment. 

214
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:57,490
Now it looks beautiful. There's obviously some typos going on in this, 

215
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:01,930
what we wanna do is get it into the incoming images right here. 

216
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:07,00
I might just leave it that way and do an assign on it. It should currently be in 

217
00:15:07,00 --> 00:15:08,140
the assets folder. 

218
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:11,740
With the hover effect. We see the size of the file, the date and time, 

219
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:14,710
and when we head down to our folder, we've got that new image. 

220
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:19,120
Now let's move on to the next step. And that's dealing with thumbnails for your video. 

221
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,550
So I was able to vibe code this little thumbnail section, and currently there is 

222
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,680
a zip file there. We'll just delete that. 

223
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:31,280
I'm going to click on this field, which is all about the assets. Now, I did do a 

224
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:36,600
little error, but this is the one we're going to rename. And when we rename it it's 

225
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:41,880
going to end up in this location. So we'll let that happen. And it's also asking 

226
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,40
do we want to discard the error video. We'll say yes to that

227
00:15:46,40 --> 00:15:50,420
And we will come back and look at thumbnails. So firstly, start a new chapter. We'll 

228
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,440
call it thumb. 

229
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:53,660
I've just come into Canva 

230
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:58,940
we've got some thumbnails going on here. We can click through and see what they are. 

231
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,240
I would like to have these thumbnails in my video. 

232
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,750
I can come up and click on the share button, go to the download, 

233
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:10,70
make sure it's on the jpeg, and then select which images I want. So I'll turn 'em 

234
00:16:10,70 --> 00:16:16,580
all off. I'll take this little blue area, we'll go number 2, 3, 4, and five, and 

235
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:20,900
we'll hit done. And at this moment, we're saving it to the system. 

236
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:26,00
so let's go back to our application. And what should happen is once it downloads, 

237
00:16:26,00 --> 00:16:27,110
it should just pop up 

238
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:31,400
if we click on preview here, we can see the five images. 

239
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:32,750
let's go take that, 

240
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:39,80
and import it. And so now we've got our images right here, but it might've been smarter 

241
00:16:39,80 --> 00:16:44,300
if we came back, made a couple of modifications if we wanted to. And then when we 

242
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:49,910
shared it, do a much more focused set of images. So we'll get rid of that thumbnail 

243
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:52,340
area and we'll get rid of number five. 

244
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:58,40
And we'll do a download. And then when we come back to our application here, we should 

245
00:16:58,40 --> 00:17:00,140
get a new zip file being created. 

246
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:04,970
We'll click on delete. We'll click on this one where we can do a preview 

247
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:08,360
these are the images that we want in our video. 

248
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:14,870
come down to our assets. Notice that we do have a thumbs folder from before it has 

249
00:17:15,50 --> 00:17:20,240
the three that we had, but we're about to click, import the selected. So we'll click 

250
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,720
on that, and now they've been updated for us.

251
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,360
So what we'll do is come back to our incoming area,

252
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:32,800
make sure we're on our recordings. We'll just do a rename of that. So this is number 

253
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:37,680
six thumb. We can also go back to our recordings right here. 

254
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:42,280
I don't currently have a restore all but I can restore them one at a time. So we'll 

255
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,280
click on that one, that one and that one. 

256
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,320
And our safe directory is now empty. 

257
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:52,150
And so as I get towards the very end of the video, what you can see is that we've 

258
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:57,250
got the final set of files they'll need to be merged. I'll use Gling AI to do that. 

259
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:02,590
I've got all my chapters here. So the intro, the scenario, how we vibe coded, a little 

260
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,660
feature with Opus 4.5, 

261
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:10,30
how we pressed a little icon to open in finder, how we looked at the assets management, 

262
00:18:10,30 --> 00:18:10,840
the thumbnail. 

263
00:18:11,50 --> 00:18:14,890
The thing is with videos, when you're doing an intro or when you're doing an outro, 

264
00:18:15,40 --> 00:18:19,240
there are other components of it. So we'll click on there. And what we've just done 

265
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,830
really is the recap. 

266
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:26,20
what I'm gonna do is click on recap, and so when it saves this video, I will know 

267
00:18:26,20 --> 00:18:31,990
that the chapter is outro. But the very specific area within the video is the recap. 

268
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:35,560
So what we'll do is we'll stop the video right here.

269
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:39,160
Start the video and rename that segment right there. 

270
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,640
what we're going to do is go into the call to action.

271
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:49,520
I'm AppyDave if you enjoy learning about coding prompt engineering, context engineering, 

272
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:53,800
then that's what I talk about all the time on this channel. If you want to join my 

273
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,560
school community, there is a link in the description. And this is where you can find 

274
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,920
prompts and different projects that I'm working on. You can find a really cool image 

275
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:06,320
about whatever the school community looks like right about here.

276
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,800
And so now what we can do is come back to our play here. We'll press.

277
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,440
Stop and the video has appeared. 

278
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:17,840
So the things that are in yellow like that, they're only because we're on the outro. 

279
00:19:18,00 --> 00:19:23,120
So if I go to summary you won't see them, you will have custom. I could put in AppyDave 

280
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:27,40
as an example. If I just want something tagged in the video, 

281
00:19:27,80 --> 00:19:31,880
Come back to the outro. Know that I just did a call to action, but I did a specific 

282
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,960
one. I did one to the school community,

283
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,960
hope you enjoyed that. I'm AppyDave. Please like and subscribe and I'll see you in 

284
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,800
the next video.

285
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:43,960
Now in the next video we're going to extend the recording system and what we're going 

286
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:49,270
to look at is the recordings themselves and as they come into the system, automatically 

287
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:50,170
transcribe them. 

288
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,850
it'll be able to suggest when we need to do calls to action things that we need to 

289
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:59,380
talk about automatically. It will be able to generate the assets that we were looking 

290
00:19:59,380 --> 00:19:59,680
at 

291
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:03,730
by generating prompts for us automatically based off the transcript. 

292
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:08,320
We'll be able to put the timestamp where they're at, and then easily create the chapter 

293
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,210
links in the YouTube description. 

294
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:13,650
So check out the link to that video right here. I'm AppyDave.
