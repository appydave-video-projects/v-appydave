Now let me give you a little bit of context we are looking at the application
there's a bunch of what I consider bad takes which are all the white area and
potential good takes in yellow and what is probably the good take in green and
I'm using Ecamm live so what's good about using Ecamm live is I can press
buttons on my stream deck and I can go to pre-configured scenes so if we wanted
to look at the coding that's over here on this monitor right here I can press
this button there's the coding going on if I'm having conversations with a
requirements document that's building the application I can look here now
another thing that I've got going on is I've got a little stream deck pedal now
if I press the right pedal right now I can pause the video long enough to reset
up the scene with a prop as I've done and if I press the button one more time
I could put the prop back on the shelf now the other thing I could do is hit
pause now the other thing I could do is automatically generate an image now
another thing I could do is use my voice to create an image prompt and then have
that image put right here and the way this is happening is through the
software that I've built that helps me automate these workflows
