And we'll come back and look at thumbnails. So firstly start a new chapter
We'll call it thumb and we will just click on the thumbs area here
And I've just come into Canva where I've got a B64
This was one of the videos I did and we've got some thumbnails going on here
We can click through and see what they are and I've decided I would like to have these thumbnails in my video
So I can come up and click on the share button go to the download make sure it's on the
Make sure it's on the jpeg and then select which images I want. So I'll turn them all off
I'll take this little blue area. We'll go number 2 3 4 and 5 and we'll hit done and at this moment
We're saving it to the system. So let's go back to our
So let's
So, let's go back to our
Application and what should happen is once it downloads it should just pop up and it has so if we click on preview here
We can see the five images now. We might go. Okay, let's go take that that and that and
Import it and so now we've got our images right here
But it might have been smarter if we came back made a couple of
Modifications if we wanted to and then when we shared it do a much more focused set of images
So we'll get rid of that thumbnail area and we'll get rid of number 5 and we'll do a download
And we'll do a done and we'll do a download and then when we come back to our application
Here, we should get a new zip file being created. There it is
Now we might want to get rid of this
We can also click on this little button to open up the downloads directory, but we won't we'll click on
Delete we'll click on this one where we can do a preview and say no
These are the images that we want in our video now before I do that
We should just come down to our assets notice that we do have a thumbs folder from before it has
The three that we had but we're about to click import the selected
So we'll click on that and now they've been updated for us
