and so as I get towards the very end of the video what you can see is that we've
got the final set of files they'll need to be merged I'll use Gling AI to do
that I love using that product and I've got all my chapters here so the intro
the scenario how we vibe coded a little feature with Opus 4.5 how we opened in
Finder from how we pressed a little icon to open in Finder how we looked at the
assets management the thumbnail now what we're going to do is get into the
outro so we'll click on income right here and basically rephrase that we're
not in the outro so now that we're in the outro what part of the outro are we
in well I would suggest that we click on this little outro button when now
because we are in the outro we're going to need a new chapter so firstly we'll
click this button and then we have this little button called outro but we're in
a very specific part of the outro use the thing is with videos when you're
doing an intro or when you're doing an outro there are other components of it
so we'll click on there and what we've just done really is the recap so what
I'm going to do is click on recap and so when it saves this video I will know
that the chapter is outro but the very specific area within the video is the
recap so what we'll do is we'll stop the video right here
