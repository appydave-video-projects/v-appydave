So I currently have three different terminals running. The bottom terminal is
the actual application so it's running and it's so it's running and it's
listening to the Ecamm live directory and just sending information directly to
the website. In here this is my software architect or my product owner
conversation and in here this is where I'm building functional requirements or
non-functional requirements. The difference is is it visible and is it
something that the user does or is it something under the system like maybe
communicating with a server. And I just recently asked it to create this
non-functional and I just recently asked it to create this functional
requirement which is can we see a timestamp and I just recently asked it to
create this functional requirement which is can we see the time of the video on
our incoming and I recently just asked it and I recently just asked it to create
this functional requirement which is and I recently asked it to create this
functional requirement which is what how and I recently asked it to create this
functional requirement which is can you tell me how many seconds the video is
actually going for. And what it did was write all this information in green I
tend to read it I know this is working very effectively and it's created a
non-functional requirement number seven for us and it's asking do I want to hand
this over to the developer so I'm just going to say yes and all it's doing at
the moment is creating for me a little instruction set that includes the
non-functional requirement it just wrote and an instruction to put it into a
different conversation window. So it's finished writing that instruction
and what I can do is just select all the information down to the bottom put it
into my clipboard and I just head over to the second conversation I've got
going on in this system and this is the developer so all the requirements are
done in the other conversation this particular conversation is showing the
developer and so the developer is off writing code we can see them side by
side if we want to I could even come over to the functional requirements
area and start preparing the next bit of work to be done but the main thing that
I'm hoping is that when it gets to this point of updating the file card but the
main thing that I'm hoping for is that when it gets to this area of
updating the file card it'll come over and will automatically see a new time
sitting right next to this 71 megabytes
why did I need to do a page refresh is there is this information not coming
through on the socket
