we can see that the last section where I was making all these changes actually
took four minutes. Now you might be thinking that's not how long the video
is on YouTube and that's because I will do some post editing because not every
bad take I do I stop the video if I've already got a really good starting part
to that section and then I have a bad take all I do is I press the all I do is
use my right foot to pause the video compose myself and then and then record
the next part. Now let's integrate these two into the main video so this is a new
chapter so we're going to go number three we're on sequence one and what
we've been doing is vibe coding using Opus 4.5 so I'll just press rename on
this particular one that'll be number one we will not discard and we will do
another rename and so both of those sections are now into my main video
recording project so now both of those sections are in my video recording
project. Now I did mention that a lot of files were also discarded so were they
deleted and the answer is no so one of the things going on in my video project
is I do have a backup in the trash can of all the recordings that I said I
didn't want just in case I do want to go back and use them but another thing
that happens once you're recording a number of videos is that the list of
current files here starts to get a little bit long so let's start working
through the capabilities that are in the recordings area so what the recordings
area is showing is the same videos that we were just looking at if we press the
folder button we can see them right here and we also have this little toggle
called safe and at the moment that's not doing anything because nothing has been
but what we could do is take the intro because I don't really need to refer to
it anymore and we'll just say safe and what that's done is moved it into a new
file right here and if we click on that we'll see that the three intros are
living in this position now if we want to do the same thing for scenario if we
want to do the same thing for chapter 2 which is the scenario we can press that
button there as well now I've also put other quality of life instructions or
I've also put some quality of I've also put some quality of life I've also put
some quality of life features into the application so if we come up here and I
know there's some sort of bug going on but what this will do when I click on it
is open finder and it's opened a second one for us but it's opened it right
where the recordings are and I have this capability throughout the system so
if we go to the configuration we can see where the ecam files are so they would
get saved into here in fact let's stop the video
