00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:05,610
Okay, this video is to showcase how you can automate video creation of things like 

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:12,350
these tables. And it comes because this table showed up on the AI-TLDR channel. 

3
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:17,600
you can see the little animation of tools appearing. It's very much based off a social 

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,620
media graphic that you see all the time, the top 10 XYZs, 

5
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,800
and they all show up. And you notice that there's a little bit of image misalignment 

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,310
going on, and it's because of the nature of how these slides were created in Canva. 

7
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:35,810
So what happened was at different times, slides were duplicated, more information 

8
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,340
was happening, and somewhere it shifted a little bit to the left. We can also see 

9
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:45,230
some misalignment in these two bars. So this is actually quite time consuming to 

10
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:51,950
do in Canva. And it's not the prettiest. It's pretty good. It's is like it is Canva. 

11
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:56,870
You can do some pretty good stuff, but what if we could take that to a much greater 

12
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:59,840
level? And that's what I wanna show with Remotion. 

13
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,90
So here we have Remotion. It looks like a video editor, a timeline video editor, 

14
00:01:05,90 --> 00:01:09,710
and it looks like that 'cause it is. But what makes it very different to any video 

15
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:15,860
editor you've ever seen is that it's a programming language based video editor. So 

16
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:20,810
everything that we see here is just little micro applications that have been, 

17
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:25,610
built. And they've got things like color controls that we can do and we can play 

18
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:30,00
around with different settings. We could change the text, which I've already done 

19
00:01:30,00 --> 00:01:32,480
once and we'll just change that. 

20
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:36,860
Hello from David. So this little hello world application, 

21
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:41,730
came with the Remotion studio, but I built a bunch of other graphics. So I think 

22
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:47,600
the first one we're gonna look at is the top 10 reveal. So if we come back over to 

23
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:54,170
the video that we're seeing here from AI-TLDR, this is a top 10 AI tools, 

24
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:59,780
reveal where we've got categories down the left and we've got AI tools down the right. 

25
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:02,90
So what I ended up doing 

26
00:02:02,90 --> 00:02:06,530
was going into ChatGPT and describing different, 

27
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:08,900
micro apps that I wanted to create. One of them is 

28
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,940
the O one top 10 reveal. 

29
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,80
And we can see the, 

30
00:02:12,80 --> 00:02:13,670
requirements docs here. 

31
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:18,560
We can change information, stuff like that. And through a little bit of extra prompt 

32
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:25,370
magic, I went in and turned it into a complex structure for video animations within 

33
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:30,200
this Remotion Hello world. And so let's go and actually have a look at 

34
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:36,740
the top 10 AI reveal tools for 2025. And we've got number four, number five, number 

35
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:41,270
six. And these are all coming through in red. That is actually changeable. If we 

36
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:45,600
wanted, we can go with that, but we'll leave it at red because number one, two, and 

37
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:50,340
three are all now about to pop in. And the good thing about this animation is I could 

38
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:54,840
go and click the render button down in the bottom right and turn this into a video. 

39
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:00,780
Now that's one sort of animation, but I saw another variation of a animation online 

40
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,550
that I thought I wanted to do for myself. So what I did is I just went over to my 

41
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:08,400
GitHub username. It's got some 88, 

42
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,870
code repositories in this. 

43
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:15,180
I wanna see this information in an animation. Now, as I was building it, I did misalign 

44
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,260
the names a little bit. 

45
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:20,820
so we are going to see this in the tweet type on is where we're going to see the 

46
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:25,780
GitHub repository. So here it's coming through. Let's just change the size of it 

47
00:03:26,10 --> 00:03:29,850
so it's a little bit more readable and we'll get rid of the property grid over on 

48
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:36,750
the right. And what we are now seeing is an animation around my guitar programming 

49
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:41,160
repository. We can put my name in there, the name of the repository. We've got the 

50
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:47,200
pinned repositories all just typing across as we go and we can see the contributions. 

51
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:52,470
And all of this was done in a one shot prompt. So then let's look at the next one 

52
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:56,910
I did, which was really a tweet like what happens if we, and that's 

53
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:02,590
when we click on this particular thing, we've got an animated Twitter post. So we 

54
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:08,370
see AppyDave AppyDave just shipped a new feature, sometimes the smallest optimizations. 

55
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:13,900
And we've got all this information coming through. Now all the data is all configurable, 

56
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:19,500
as you can see over here on the right in the property grid. And all of it was generated 

57
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,260
in one shot prompt based on 

58
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,620
a little prompt structure that I put together for Remotion. 

59
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,140
Now for the last one, I wanted to, 

60
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,870
look into an idea that I've had on my channel a 

61
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:36,340
year and a half ago, and it was animated YouTube outros. Now it doesn't look like 

62
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:40,960
what I want, but most of the information is there. So what we're seeing at the moment 

63
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:46,90
is the sort of thing that I kind of say at the end of a YouTube video. Usually I 

64
00:04:46,90 --> 00:04:46,500
say, 

65
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:51,120
I'll do a little bit of a recap. I'll talk about what the next video is. I'll ask 

66
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,620
for a like and subscribe. 

67
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:52,830
I'll 

68
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,180
maybe suggest people, 

69
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,740
comment down below and tell 'em what's coming up next. So here it is AppyDave, we've 

70
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:03,630
got the number of subscribers. Here are three videos that you might find interesting. 

71
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:07,680
Please like and subscribe and I'll see you in the next video. And then the next video 

72
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,940
can pop up like this and that could be what it is. And I could also tell people about 

73
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:17,110
the chapter codes. So all of this animation, again, was a one shot prompt. 

74
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:21,790
and it built it all. Now it's just a case of tweaking it to make it look pretty. 

75
00:05:22,60 --> 00:05:29,770
So this is using prompt engineering, Claude code and promotion to generate any sort 

76
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:34,420
of animation that you want, where you're doing infographics and information like 

77
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:34,660
that.
