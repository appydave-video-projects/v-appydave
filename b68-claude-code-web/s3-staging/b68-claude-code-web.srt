00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:04,920
Have you become a fan of Claude Code? I certainly have, and in this video we're going 

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,480
to look at a new capability that they've created, which is Claude Code in the web. 

3
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:11,270
I'm AppyDave. Let's get into it.

4
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:16,110
On the weekend, I was at an AI meetup group and we were talking about Claude Code 

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,920
on the web, and one of the people in the meetup group was actually using his phone 

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:28,440
at the time and creating PRs on code with little requests to have agents do work 

7
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:33,560
for him while we were in the meetup group. And what I thought I'd do is test out 

8
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:39,350
Claude Code myself with a little problem that's plaguing me at the moment. It's to 

9
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,790
do with the amount of documentation that I've created 

10
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:47,550
And I thought this would be a great test to see what I can do with it. 

11
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:53,710
So the positioned Claude Code as a new way of interacting on the web. And the way 

12
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:58,790
it works is that if you've got a repo set up on your system and you've connected 

13
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:04,390
it to Claude Code, it can create a pull request and start executing the prompt that 

14
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:08,150
you give it. And the good thing is, if you have multiple tasks that you want to run, 

15
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:10,840
They all exist in their own pull requests, 

16
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,920
and they all get tested within isolated environments.

17
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,390
Now this stating here that it's flexible for every task will figure out whether that's 

18
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:23,590
actually true or not. But it's concepts like answering questions should be easy to 

19
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:26,750
do. Bug fixes that are done from well-defined

20
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:32,710
documentation should be easy. So we could use the BMAD method. Or we could do PRDs 

21
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:38,150
or requirements documents, and just making basic back end changes that can also be 

22
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:42,200
tested by unit tests. And the reason this will work is because it will spin up an 

23
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,590
isolated environment and do all the integration or unit tests for you.

24
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,120
Now, they say, from a security first cloud execution point of view, that every task 

25
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,880
is in an isolated sandbox environment. 

26
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,920
I've already connected up all my GitHub repositories, and I have a lot of them across 

27
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,320
multiple organizations coming through. So we've got little tutorial organizations 

28
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,920
that I've had. I've got 88 repositories in one of my main organizations, and then 

29
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,400
I've got stuff around AppyDave that I do right now. Now the one we're working with 

30
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,680
today is going to be Support Signal. 

31
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:22,680
And Support signal is a set of websites and cloud applications that have been put 

32
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:28,640
together using vibe coding or really context engineering using the BMAD method. It's 

33
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:34,520
got concepts like the ability to use AI to record incidents. We've got all these 

34
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,560
users, multi-tenancy, security, all that sort of stuff going on. A little bit of 

35
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:45,360
company management in the back end with the ability to update users, participants. 

36
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:51,560
So it's a fairly complex application designed to allow people to enter in an incident 

37
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:57,800
and have that incident enhanced with AI through asking different questions based 

38
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,00
on whatever was said.

39
00:02:59,00 --> 00:03:04,190
Now all of this application was done using Claude code and just using it from the 

40
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:08,720
terminal. And if we were to start it up, it's relatively complex. 

41
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,740
we've got three different servers that we run. One for the web, one for the convex 

42
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:13,310
database, 

43
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:18,50
and one for the log ingestion server. And under each of those, we've also got the 

44
00:03:18,50 --> 00:03:22,940
unit tests that we can run for each of those particular applications. So they're 

45
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,110
going through at the moment 

46
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:29,540
Now personally, I think Claude Code in the terminal is an incredible product. It's 

47
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,700
been able to build that application, 

48
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:37,250
that you were seeing, and it was all done using a context engineering framework called 

49
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:42,920
the BMAD Method. But when you look at the code base, it's all, all the code, whether 

50
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,580
it be the convex server, the web server, or the worker server, 

51
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:52,10
the whole set of applications were built just using prompts. And all of those prompts 

52
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:56,990
are all documented in the docs file. So within this docs file, we've got concept 

53
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:02,330
like custom agents that I've built, analysis, we've got the API, the architecture. 

54
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:07,130
Some of this came out of the BMAD method. It's been enhanced over time. We've got 

55
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,480
design systems, 

56
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,40
and then we've got this massive bulk of information, which is all the knowledge that's 

57
00:04:13,40 --> 00:04:15,380
been generated during the process. 

58
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:20,90
So as the application was being built, there were many epics, there were many stories, 

59
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,820
and everything was context engineered. 

60
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:27,830
So that's an overview of all the code. I'm wondering personally how I can use 

61
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:32,420
the web version. When you look at something like this screen where you've got three 

62
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:32,870
different 

63
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:37,490
web servers, you've got three different unit test systems, how can we work with it 

64
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:38,960
from a web interface?

65
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:45,280
So what I thought we'd do is go into Claude Webb and point it at the repository, 

66
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,400
also pointed at the particular docs folders and see if we can just get it to clean 

67
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,240
everything up, analyze it, make it more readable than it is at the moment. Because 

68
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,870
at the moment, after 3 or 4 months of coding an enterprise application, some of the 

69
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:04,360
documentation is a little bit scattered and duplicated.

70
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:11,320
So I've come over to Claude Code AI code, and one of the things I've done is selected 

71
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,280
the repository I want to work in, and I've just got a starting prompt. The user is 

72
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:21,120
seeking a comprehensive audit of all documentation files in the system. We're looking 

73
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,480
at the BMAD method. We want to see the early documentation created by BMAD like the 

74
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:31,360
PRD and the architecture. We want to understand the epics and stories. This is the 

75
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:36,960
working documentation that's being created. There's about 11 epics and many stories 

76
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:44,160
in the system. And then I use a system called KDD Knowledge Driven Development, and 

77
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,840
that's the area that I really want to get cleaned up as well. So what I think we'll 

78
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:52,40
do is just kick it off and see what happens.

79
00:05:52,40 --> 00:05:57,470
So it started writing a file for us. It's in the dots area. It's called an analysis 

80
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:02,620
sub folder and documentation audit by type. And it's stating here, 

81
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:06,250
it's completed the audit of all the documentation. 

82
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:11,440
And this is how I felt it would be. We've got the BMAD method and the agents over 

83
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,910
62 files. We've got all the technical guides, which are kind of the rules and 

84
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:21,320
instructions that I've built along the way. We've got all the stories coming through. 

85
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:26,990
We've got the patterns and practices. So I'm looking for architecture, coding patterns. 

86
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:32,150
And there's a lot of stuff around error handling strategies and testing patterns. 

87
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:36,860
The lessons learned, this is where we've got the antipatterns coming through. 

88
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,330
platform constraints, 

89
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:43,10
because the main system is around the incident analysis. There's a lot of documentation 

90
00:06:43,10 --> 00:06:43,820
going on there. 

91
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:49,280
And also whenever I do a story, I have it create a story acceptance test, which is 

92
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,560
just what either human need to go through 

93
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,430
and test. 

94
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:58,280
And these were actually written in a way that tools like Open AI's Atlas could actually 

95
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,390
do the work for me. 

96
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:04,520
So we can see a bit of a characteristics of the different documents going on and 

97
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,480
what's it doing now. 

98
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,510
So it looks like we've only got this one file. It's, 

99
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:13,970
done a git add. We've got a commit message coming through here. And if we go and 

100
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:19,340
have a look at my repositories and organizations, we'll go down to Support Signal 

101
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:24,110
where we've got multiple repositories. The one we're interested in is the app support 

102
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,960
signal. And look at that. It's created a pull request for us. 

103
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:33,110
Now with this here, I could come up and press the create pull request within GitHub, 

104
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:39,140
but I am aware that there's also a button directly in Claude code or Claude code 

105
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:42,560
on the web. And let's try pressing that and see what happens.

106
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,320
So the click create PR, it looks like it's just doing the same thing,

107
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:52,680
just with a slightly different title to when I did it manually. So I don't think 

108
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,520
it matters which way we go. We'll just go create pull request

109
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,760
and it's currently running through the CI pipeline down below. And if we click over 

110
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,360
here, we can see the one file that's been changed.

111
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,840
If we go towards the bottom of that particular file, I think it might even have a 

112
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,80
little bit of a plan of action or recommendations that we can move forward with.

113
00:08:12,80 --> 00:08:17,440
So let's come back to Claude Code we could move forward. I noticed that we've got 

114
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:23,800
a view PR I'm assuming it's going to take us to the same location it is. Looks like 

115
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,440
CI has run. Let's just run the actions and see how

116
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,400
the continuous integration pipeline is working. We've got audit and categorized E 

117
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:38,440
to E test, linting and testing and deploying the convex back end. That's the database 

118
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:44,640
building the application. Also deploying the Next.js application to Cloudflare pages 

119
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,80
seems to have all been working.

120
00:08:47,80 --> 00:08:50,800
So we can just come back to Claude Code and execute our next prompt.

121
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,330
So I've let it run a little prompt. If the goal of the pool request is to clean up 

122
00:08:55,330 --> 00:09:01,90
five months worth of documentation and all we've got is the audit that we've built, 

123
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,280
what would it prioritize? What order would it do things in? So it's talking about 

124
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:11,200
removing the duplicates, which is an easy win. This is, I think, the first thing 

125
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,160
that should happen next. We need to be able to find documents quickly, so getting 

126
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:19,750
all the indexes up to date is really important. After that, it should be able to 

127
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:25,330
archive or remove stale content. I don't know how it's going to go about that. I 

128
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:29,110
know I have that folder. I don't think this is the right area for it, but we can 

129
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:34,690
work on that when we get to it. I'm sure maybe the date timestamp of files will be 

130
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:38,20
important. And then we can go into a consolidated, 

131
00:09:38,20 --> 00:09:43,960
documentation view. Now, one of the things I noticed is that unlike other chats systems, 

132
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:49,180
if you did this a little bit incorrectly, you can't edit it and keep moving. And 

133
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:53,530
this is the same in Claude code as well. Once you put information in, it's in the 

134
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:56,50
context window and you can't fork it.

135
00:09:56,50 --> 00:10:01,170
Now, the simple little prompt I'm running here is break it into four detailed tasks. 

136
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:04,530
We're only going to work on one at a time, but

137
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:10,610
so like Claude Code, it just goes into its own internal TO-DO system. We're going 

138
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:11,650
to update there.

139
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:17,170
If this was normal Claude Code in the terminal we'd have a command T which shows 

140
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:19,130
or hides this sort of stuff. 

141
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:23,90
we can't expect it to be working the same way as Claude Code right now. One of the 

142
00:10:23,90 --> 00:10:26,930
other things to notice if we look up in the top left hand corner, I'm not sure if 

143
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:33,810
it's showing in the video, but I started off at $997 worth of credits. Currently 

144
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:39,490
we're at $995 worth of credits, so it's a lot of work done, 

145
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:42,410
but it could add up over time with a dollar here. $2 there.

146
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:47,770
Now, normally I would go deep and read this, but because it's just part of the video, 

147
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:52,610
we're just going to work through them quickly. So we've got task one, remove duplicates, 

148
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:57,730
we've got update the indexes. It's identified a lot of information here. Remove the 

149
00:10:57,730 --> 00:10:59,530
stale content. 

150
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:04,890
in fact I should get it to remove anything from Gemini. I don't use Gemini CLI within 

151
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:09,450
this application anymore. Consolidate related documentation. 

152
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:16,290
say get going and see how long this actually takes. It's currently 9 a.m. in the 

153
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:17,690
morning on a Sunday.

154
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:22,580
Now, funnily enough, we're only about a minute into this and it got to the GI commit, 

155
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:28,970
but I was just looking at it on the phone and refreshed, and it talked about having, 

156
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:33,170
enable notifications. So I'm going to turn that on. 

157
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:38,780
press allow. I'm on an Android phone at the moment, and we can see hopefully on that. 

158
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:44,660
You can see that task one is complete, but what we'll do is we'll bring it over to 

159
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:47,90
the web interface and 

160
00:11:47,90 --> 00:11:50,390
it's working through things. We've got a bunch of code 

161
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:53,600
removed. Let's click on this View PR button. 

162
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,850
So it's come up to the audit and categorize or documentation files. We've now got 

163
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:05,240
two commits, so let's click on this and see that something happened a minute ago. 

164
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:10,580
So remove duplicate bmad command files. So we come in here. 

165
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:15,590
Now, the interesting thing about this is that this could actually be a big mistake. 

166
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:20,840
code base. I'm going to use Claude code from the terminal to check this. But essentially 

167
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:26,690
what it's done is it's notice that BMAD is in two locations, which makes sense. It's 

168
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:32,690
where it gets installed. BM a core, but it's also been embedded into the commands 

169
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:38,270
directory. Now the thing is, this was done four or five months ago, so the version 

170
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:38,630
of 

171
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:42,980
BMAD that I'm using is not the same as it is today, and I know 

172
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:47,300
whether it's been done in this area. So this is actually an area I'm going to do 

173
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,240
some manual review on before I allow it through.

174
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:56,30
Now so far it's actually finished three of the tasks that it needed to do. I asked, 

175
00:12:56,90 --> 00:12:59,690
are there any more to do? There's a fourth one remaining. This is where the bulk 

176
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:04,910
of the work is, and when I actually do this, I'm going to have to pay a lot of attention 

177
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:08,990
to it. But the good thing is I should be able to run it all from my mobile phone 

178
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,90
and check files that are being created. Now, there was one issue and I did ask it 

179
00:13:14,90 --> 00:13:15,590
to go and check into it. 

180
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:20,570
and so if we go and have a look at my conversation with Claude code in the terminal, 

181
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:26,180
I asked it whether there was an issue with deleting the particular agents that we 

182
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:30,620
did because there's kind of clones of them. There's the original and there's one 

183
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:34,880
in include code, and it said yes. This is a big problem. So what we're going to do 

184
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,250
is copy all this information right here, 

185
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:41,150
come back to our conversation and we're going to paste it in. Now, one of the things 

186
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:46,550
I noticed this particular file that we also need, you can't drag files into the web 

187
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:47,660
interface just yet. 

188
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:53,240
So instead, I'm grabbing the file off Visual Studio and I'm just going to paste it 

189
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:58,940
in directly and I'll let it go work through and come up with a plan of action to 

190
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:02,840
reverse that, commit or reset the files, whatever it needs to do. 

191
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:08,390
So it'll be working through the files that it lost. We've got a little bit of a corrected 

192
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,830
architecture pattern here, 

193
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:14,300
and it's making the changes. If we go and look at our pull requests, we've now got 

194
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:19,160
seven commits and we're back to only eight files changed on the system. 

195
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:23,690
So at the end of this session, what we've got is we've got a little bit of an update 

196
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:29,00
around the clawed files. We've got our audit by type, which is documented. We can 

197
00:14:29,00 --> 00:14:33,920
use it in the future. We also know where we're at with the cleanup process. 

198
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,960
It's backed up the old historical file. We've got new navigation updates and various 

199
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,430
indexes in place. 

200
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:43,790
we've also got a little bit of architecture updates.

201
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:49,190
So that brings us to the end of the session on Claude Code web. So far, I think it 

202
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:54,110
has a lot of potential. I really loved hearing how other people at the AI meetup 

203
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:59,470
group that I go to use it for just sitting in coffee shops or meetings like they 

204
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:04,590
were on the day and just asking for new pull requests to be created. So what I think 

205
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:09,150
I'll do now is go off and have a coffee and keep working on the documentation in 

206
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:12,310
the background. I'm AppyDave I'll see you in the next video.
