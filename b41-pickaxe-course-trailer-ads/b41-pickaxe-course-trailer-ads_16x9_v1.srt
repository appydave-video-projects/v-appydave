00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,233
Have you seen video advertisements that are just incredible? They sell, they convert, 

2
00:00:05,233 --> 00:00:10,166
they hook you in and you wish. How do I write a transcript like that so I can generate 

3
00:00:10,166 --> 00:00:11,866
my own video advertisement. 

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:16,500
In this video, we're going to reverse engineer one such video and turn it into an 

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,566
AI agent that you can use yourself. I'm AppyDave, let's get into it.

6
00:00:20,566 --> 00:00:25,466
So here's the underlying scenario that I'm trying to address. I have this YouTube 

7
00:00:25,466 --> 00:00:30,033
channel called AI-TLDR. It has 148 videos. It's 

8
00:00:30,033 --> 00:00:34,700
over the 800 subscribers, and it's growing fairly quickly. And when you look through 

9
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:40,333
this particular channel, you'll notice that every video in here is created fairly 

10
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:46,600
quickly. It's all AI generated using tools like Cap Cut and Canva, 11 Labs and a 

11
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:54,433
variety of video and image generation tools like DZine, Leonardo AI, and SORA. And 

12
00:00:54,433 --> 00:00:59,433
what I've been able to put together is an outline for a lesson plan that people could 

13
00:00:59,433 --> 00:01:05,300
follow if they wanted to build AI generated video channels very much like this one. 

14
00:01:05,533 --> 00:01:10,533
But the problem I've got before I even create the course is how am I going to sell 

15
00:01:10,533 --> 00:01:15,400
it? And that's what led me to the path of going, let's generate a bunch of video 

16
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:20,200
advertisements, which means we need high impact transcripts, and that's what we're 

17
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,333
going to solve today.

18
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:26,100
So in this video we're going to take an advertisement, this particular one that I've 

19
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:31,033
seen online that markets a product very similar to the course that I'm trying to 

20
00:01:31,033 --> 00:01:36,033
build. And then what we're going to do is take the transcript that they've produced 

21
00:01:36,033 --> 00:01:42,200
and reverse engineer it so that we can build our own AI bot to generate new transcripts 

22
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,633
in a style more appropriate to my target audience.

23
00:01:45,633 --> 00:01:51,466
So let me introduce you to Pickaxe. What Pickaxe is, is a tool that allows you to 

24
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:57,666
build and deploy your own bespoke AI agents. And the really good thing about these 

25
00:01:57,666 --> 00:02:02,933
agents is that you can host them in a beautiful website, and you can make them available 

26
00:02:02,933 --> 00:02:07,600
to people, either for free or for a cost. So you can monetize with this. And the 

27
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,600
great thing is, in the project that we're doing today, there's a zero cost. We won't 

28
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:17,166
be using too many credits, so we'll be able to work with the free plan to get this 

29
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:21,666
up and running. Now, I do have an affiliate link down below if you want a discount 

30
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:25,566
on any of the plans here, but if you wait till a bit later in the video, I'll talk 

31
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,733
about a special deal that's going on with the gold plan.

32
00:02:28,733 --> 00:02:33,433
But let's start building the agent. And what we do is we come over to the area where 

33
00:02:33,433 --> 00:02:38,200
you can create a new Pickaxe. And the sort that we're going with today is a simple 

34
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:43,200
form. So when we click on that, we end up with this page where we can configure the 

35
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,133
role, the prompts, any of the fields that we want the user to interact with. And 

36
00:02:48,133 --> 00:02:52,533
we'll be able to see the actual test example over here on the right.

37
00:02:52,533 --> 00:02:58,066
So to get started, I'm going to take one of the video advertisements that I've seen. 

38
00:02:58,266 --> 00:03:04,033
Grab the transcript and we're going to go and manipulate that within ChatGPT, and 

39
00:03:04,033 --> 00:03:05,400
reverse engineer it.

40
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,933
So what I've done here is taken the transcript. You can see it all listed in this 

41
00:03:09,933 --> 00:03:14,933
section. And I've just given it a little bit of a pre prompt. And I'm just trying 

42
00:03:14,933 --> 00:03:20,600
to analyze what sort of concepts are going on inside of this advertisement. I'm not 

43
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:28,566
actually reading the advertisement. I just want to understand the concepts. 
and we've got a high level categorization framework where we're talking about pattern 

44
00:03:28,566 --> 00:03:33,366
interrupts, relatable pain points. We've got the villain and who to blame. One of 

45
00:03:33,366 --> 00:03:34,966
the things that are going on here is 

46
00:03:34,966 --> 00:03:40,700
this around. And there's also the CTAs. Many of these items will be dropdowns. I'm 

47
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:44,066
envisaging in an AI bot that we put together.

48
00:03:44,066 --> 00:03:49,133
Now, after the breakdown of this particular advertisement, there's also a bunch of 

49
00:03:49,133 --> 00:03:53,933
ideas like the tone the audience fit. And to me, these are variables that we might 

50
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:58,733
want to have in an AI agent. So the next thing I want to do is write a couple of 

51
00:03:58,733 --> 00:04:04,500
prompts against this information, so that we can come up with a good way of writing 

52
00:04:04,533 --> 00:04:09,766
advertisement transcripts in general, and identifying what sort of variables and 

53
00:04:09,766 --> 00:04:14,400
the values they have so that we can make it a configurable AI agent.

54
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,366
So what I want to do now is get general rules for advertisements. Now I want to base 

55
00:04:19,366 --> 00:04:24,266
it on the transcript above because I do like it. I also want to take broader examples. 

56
00:04:24,266 --> 00:04:28,533
So we're going to search the internet. So what we're looking at here is just getting 

57
00:04:28,533 --> 00:04:32,566
the generalized idea of high converting video adds 

58
00:04:32,566 --> 00:04:38,100
and making it available that we might use as a second brain with inside the agent 

59
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,133
that we're building.

60
00:04:39,133 --> 00:04:43,633
So looking through this, this is perfect. We've got structural rules. We've got six 

61
00:04:43,633 --> 00:04:48,366
different types coming through. Here we go a bit further down. We've got psychology 

62
00:04:48,366 --> 00:04:54,433
rules and we've got hook formulas. What I'd like to do with this now is maybe identify 

63
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:59,500
variables that we could use. So this can be the second brain for sure. In the AI 

64
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:04,800
agent. We're probably also want to load it up with a bunch of successful adverts 

65
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,600
that we create over time, but we can't do that until we build them. But for now, 

66
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:13,766
let's just see if we can write a little prompt here that identifies variables that 

67
00:05:13,766 --> 00:05:18,166
might be useful for an end user using this particular tool.

68
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:23,433
Now this information is going to be perfect for building the forms for the AI agent, 

69
00:05:23,433 --> 00:05:29,200
but to simplify it, I think I just need a tabular grid that shows the variable name. 

70
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:34,666
Maybe the type of data. Is it a drop down list or a text box? Maybe some examples. 

71
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:40,233
So we'll just put in a prompt here and we'll just see how this goes at generating 

72
00:05:40,233 --> 00:05:46,100
that information. So it's talking about the idea of variables being in lowercase 

73
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:51,900
snakecase. So you can see that down the left we've got a label a type of input and 

74
00:05:51,900 --> 00:06:00,766
some example values. So when I go over to the AI agent builder 
the tool I'm going to use is Pickaxe, then I'm going to have all the variables and 

75
00:06:00,766 --> 00:06:03,033
values that we can just fill in.

76
00:06:03,033 --> 00:06:07,566
Now, one of the problems with the list of variables that are being created is that 

77
00:06:07,566 --> 00:06:12,200
they're too fine grained. It would make the tool too hard to use, and it would be 

78
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:16,800
too constrained, because you've got to put in a little bit of information about every 

79
00:06:16,866 --> 00:06:22,133
sort of variable. So what I've done is just written one more prompt to just reduce 

80
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:27,533
it down to five different variables, just the highest level ones going on, plus a 

81
00:06:27,566 --> 00:06:32,500
custom instruction for if something else is needed. Apart from that, we now need 

82
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:37,400
to develop a prompt and a role. So we'll just paste in this little prompt here. This 

83
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:42,100
is about developing the role for the AI agent. And let's see what we get.

84
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:48,300
This is perfect. And I add agent that generates high converting scroll stopping video 

85
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:51,366
ad scripts. 
Next we'll do a description.

86
00:06:51,366 --> 00:06:56,533
The last piece in the puzzle is we're going to need a prompt. So I've just put in 

87
00:06:56,533 --> 00:07:03,533
this meta prompt. It'll generate a prompt that is for high converting video ad generator. 

88
00:07:03,533 --> 00:07:08,533
We've got a bunch of information. We've got the input variables coming through. So 

89
00:07:08,533 --> 00:07:14,800
we should be able to use this pretty much as it is inside our AI agent. 

90
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,633
Now we'll head over to Pickaxe and we'll start filling in this agent, and we'll use 

91
00:07:19,633 --> 00:07:25,133
a lot of the information that we just developed. So the first area I want is a name 

92
00:07:25,133 --> 00:07:30,466
for the agent. And I've asked for a name that is keyword rich rather than branding 

93
00:07:30,466 --> 00:07:36,200
rich, because I want people to be able to find this in a marketplace. So the one 

94
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:42,100
I think I'll go with is the hook based video script tool. And we can just go up here 

95
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:47,300
and paste it in. The next area we should look for is the role that we talked about 

96
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:53,400
earlier. 
So we developed a role right here. And we can just take that particular information 

97
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,566
and head over to the role and paste it in.

98
00:07:56,566 --> 00:08:01,500
The next area we want to work on is this prompt, and we've already got a partial 

99
00:08:01,533 --> 00:08:07,200
set up for it. We have the main instructions. We understand what the input variables 

100
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:12,100
are. Now I'm going to rename this to Input Variable guidelines. And then after that 

101
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:17,333
I want to supply the actual user input variables. And then finally I want to have 

102
00:08:17,366 --> 00:08:23,200
output instructions. So I've just reframed that information into a code block right 

103
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:27,933
here. One of the things that you can notice is that the user supplied inputs are 

104
00:08:27,933 --> 00:08:32,766
all ready to go. So we'll just click on copy code here and we'll paste that right 

105
00:08:32,766 --> 00:08:38,400
in here. Now with that in place what we can do is work on changing the actual input 

106
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,233
variables.

107
00:08:39,233 --> 00:08:44,666
Now, with the prompt in place, what we can do is add user input anywhere we like. 

108
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,466
So I'm just going to double click on this value and say add user input and we'll 

109
00:08:49,466 --> 00:08:54,300
see a new field. Now for the actual title, this is where we'll just come back up 

110
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:58,066
here and select the information and paste it in. 

111
00:08:58,066 --> 00:09:01,900
this will be the instruction field that people will see on the form. And then we 

112
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,866
can just go through and repeat it for each variable.

113
00:09:04,866 --> 00:09:09,900
So now on the left we have our complete prompt. We've got all our user inputs. When 

114
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:14,233
you click on them that'll take you to the field over on the right. Now if there's 

115
00:09:14,233 --> 00:09:18,666
anything you want to change around the structure, and I think custom instructions 

116
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:24,133
is the main one we'll change is that we'll go from short answer to long answer. We 

117
00:09:24,133 --> 00:09:29,133
should be able to put in 1000 characters right there. Now this is not required, but 

118
00:09:29,133 --> 00:09:34,066
we might make all the others required because without them you're losing a bit of 

119
00:09:34,066 --> 00:09:37,333
the energy. So we'll just make them all required.

120
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:43,433
Now this is a free text box so you can put any value in there. But it might be useful 

121
00:09:43,433 --> 00:09:47,700
also to have a sample. Now we could put the information

122
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,666
directly into the field like this. I'll just paste that in. And you can see that 

123
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:56,600
there's multiple values and they'll be overridable. But for this example there is 

124
00:09:56,666 --> 00:10:01,133
very short. I might just put them in as part of the heading.

125
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:06,766
Now here we have our configuration updated. The custom instruction is long. Each 

126
00:10:06,766 --> 00:10:12,400
of the different fields that we want to fill in are also supplied with some examples 

127
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:17,433
in the heading. And the way this looks now is that we've got the custom instruction 

128
00:10:17,466 --> 00:10:23,900
hook type. You can type in shock or for the pain target we could put bad technique 

129
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:27,400
or something like that. And the good thing about this is that if you want to use 

130
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,166
a different value, you can.

131
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:34,533
Now, what I would like to do is test out this Pickaxe. And what we can do is click 

132
00:10:34,566 --> 00:10:39,566
save and it will take us back to the main screen where we can click on the preview 

133
00:10:39,566 --> 00:10:45,000
button. So if we come up here, you can see how you can open it up in a new window.

134
00:10:45,033 --> 00:10:50,700
And our configured hook based video script is here. We can fill in all the values 

135
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:53,533
and press submit. So let's test it out.

136
00:10:53,533 --> 00:10:59,000
So let's fill in a few example fields. So we've got the hook type humor shock or 

137
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,566
curiosity. I'm going to go with shock. After that is what do we think we want to 

138
00:11:04,566 --> 00:11:09,433
get the audience member to feel in this case just emotional failure. They've tried 

139
00:11:09,433 --> 00:11:13,366
to do something, but they've failed at it in the past. Maybe this is something we 

140
00:11:13,366 --> 00:11:18,366
can tap into. Then who is the villain in the story? Could be themselves. It could 

141
00:11:18,366 --> 00:11:22,366
be some sort of guru that they've learned from. I'm going to go with themselves. 

142
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:27,866
And then what do we want to show them is going to come through if they follow through 

143
00:11:27,866 --> 00:11:33,000
on the offer? So maybe it's a mini framework. Maybe it's the contrast of before and 

144
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,866
after 
So then the call to action. Do you want to send them to an offer. Maybe a community 

145
00:11:37,866 --> 00:11:40,166
with this will go with a direct offer.

146
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:44,066
Now, in this case, I don't want it to randomly come up with a story. I want to have 

147
00:11:44,066 --> 00:11:48,800
some sort of character that we're working towards. So we'll just dictate for a second 

148
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,600
and we'll go.

149
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:55,166
You are a freelance video editor. You're pretty good at creating videos, but for 

150
00:11:55,166 --> 00:12:01,166
some reason the content never seems to engage, and you suspect that the issue is 

151
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:05,766
with your script writing. And you're wondering, is there a tool out there that can 

152
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,833
produce beautiful scripts for YouTube every time?

153
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:14,933
Now let's say there's something custom, maybe a custom avatar or some other sorts 

154
00:12:14,933 --> 00:12:18,933
of style that you want to introduce. Then you can use the custom instruction. And 

155
00:12:18,933 --> 00:12:24,100
what I've done is I've gone over to ChatGPT, and I've asked questions about 18 to 

156
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:29,500
30 year old men, and it's come up with a good set of information that I can just 

157
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:35,766
take and paste directly into the custom instruction to frame and shape the script 

158
00:12:35,766 --> 00:12:37,300
to meet this criteria.

159
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:42,533
So with everything filled in, we can just come down and click the submit button. 

160
00:12:42,533 --> 00:12:47,066
And what I'll do is that agent will start processing using a large language 

161
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,800
We're using ChatGPT, for a mini.

162
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,866
So it's quickly written a script for us. It starts off with a line. Ever felt like 

163
00:12:53,866 --> 00:12:58,066
your videos are just meh? Now, to test this out properly, what I'll do is I'll just 

164
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:03,333
add it to 11 labs and do some basic graphics just to get a feel for what this script 

165
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:04,266
could look like.

166
00:13:04,266 --> 00:13:09,533
Ever feel like your videos are just man, you're editing your heart out, but it's 

167
00:13:09,533 --> 00:13:16,033
like no one even notices. What gives? Real talk. It's not your fault you're stuck 

168
00:13:16,033 --> 00:13:21,633
in the loop of outdated advice. The problem? Your scripts are missing that spark. 

169
00:13:21,766 --> 00:13:25,766
But what if I told you there's a mini framework that changes everything?

170
00:13:25,766 --> 00:13:31,800
Picture this. Killer scripts that hook viewers in seconds. Yeah, it's totally doable.

173
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:46,933

174
00:13:46,933 --> 00:13:51,266
you would have noticed in that video was that it was put together really quickly. 

175
00:13:51,266 --> 00:13:57,266
There is actually a call to action there to the AI. TLDR YouTube channel, where you 

176

177
00:14:01,033 --> 00:14:06,833
