00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:05,250
Have you seen video advertisements that are just incredible? They sell, they convert, 

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:10,170
they hook you in and you wish. How do I write a transcript like that so I can generate 

3
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:11,890
my own video advertisement. 

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:16,500
In this video, we're going to reverse engineer one such video and turn it into an 

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,580
AI agent that you can use yourself. I'm AppyDave, let's get into it.

6
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:25,470
So here's the underlying scenario that I'm trying to address. I have this YouTube 

7
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:30,60
channel called AI-TLDR. It has 148 videos. It's 

8
00:00:30,60 --> 00:00:34,710
over the 800 subscribers, and it's growing fairly quickly. And when you look through 

9
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:40,350
this particular channel, you'll notice that every video in here is created fairly 

10
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:46,620
quickly. It's all AI generated using tools like Cap Cut and Canva, 11 Labs and a 

11
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:54,450
variety of video and image generation tools like DZine, Leonardo AI, and SORA. And 

12
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:59,460
what I've been able to put together is an outline for a lesson plan that people could 

13
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:05,310
follow if they wanted to build AI generated video channels very much like this one. 

14
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:10,560
But the problem I've got before I even create the course is how am I going to sell 

15
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,420
it? And that's what led me to the path of going, let's generate a bunch of video 

16
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,220
advertisements, which means we need high impact transcripts, and that's what we're 

17
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,360
going to solve today.

18
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,130
So in this video we're going to take an advertisement, this particular one that I've 

19
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:31,50
seen online that markets a product very similar to the course that I'm trying to 

20
00:01:31,50 --> 00:01:36,50
build. And then what we're going to do is take the transcript that they've produced 

21
00:01:36,50 --> 00:01:42,210
and reverse engineer it so that we can build our own AI bot to generate new transcripts 

22
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:45,650
in a style more appropriate to my target audience.

23
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:51,470
So let me introduce you to Pickaxe. What Pickaxe is, is a tool that allows you to 

24
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:57,670
build and deploy your own bespoke AI agents. And the really good thing about these 

25
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:02,950
agents is that you can host them in a beautiful website, and you can make them available 

26
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:07,630
to people, either for free or for a cost. So you can monetize with this. And the 

27
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:12,630
great thing is, in the project that we're doing today, there's a zero cost. We won't 

28
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:17,190
be using too many credits, so we'll be able to work with the free plan to get this 

29
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:21,670
up and running. Now, I do have an affiliate link down below if you want a discount 

30
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:25,590
on any of the plans here, but if you wait till a bit later in the video, I'll talk 

31
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:28,750
about a special deal that's going on with the gold plan.

32
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:33,440
But let's start building the agent. And what we do is we come over to the area where 

33
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,200
you can create a new Pickaxe. And the sort that we're going with today is a simple 

34
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:43,200
form. So when we click on that, we end up with this page where we can configure the 

35
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,160
role, the prompts, any of the fields that we want the user to interact with. And 

36
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,560
we'll be able to see the actual test example over here on the right.

37
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,90
So to get started, I'm going to take one of the video advertisements that I've seen. 

38
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:04,50
Grab the transcript and we're going to go and manipulate that within ChatGPT, and 

39
00:03:04,50 --> 00:03:05,410
reverse engineer it.

40
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:09,950
So what I've done here is taken the transcript. You can see it all listed in this 

41
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:14,950
section. And I've just given it a little bit of a pre prompt. And I'm just trying 

42
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:20,630
to analyze what sort of concepts are going on inside of this advertisement. I'm not 

43
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:24,350
actually reading the advertisement. I just want to understand the concepts. 

44
00:03:24,30 --> 00:03:28,590
and we've got a high level categorization framework where we're talking about pattern 

45
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:33,390
interrupts, relatable pain points. We've got the villain and who to blame. One of 

46
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:34,990
the things that are going on here is 

47
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:40,720
this around. And there's also the CTAs. Many of these items will be dropdowns. I'm 

48
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,80
envisaging in an AI bot that we put together.

49
00:03:44,90 --> 00:03:49,150
Now, after the breakdown of this particular advertisement, there's also a bunch of 

50
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:53,950
ideas like the tone the audience fit. And to me, these are variables that we might 

51
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:58,750
want to have in an AI agent. So the next thing I want to do is write a couple of 

52
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:04,510
prompts against this information, so that we can come up with a good way of writing 

53
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:09,790
advertisement transcripts in general, and identifying what sort of variables and 

54
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:14,430
the values they have so that we can make it a configurable AI agent.

55
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:19,390
So what I want to do now is get general rules for advertisements. Now I want to base 

56
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:24,270
it on the transcript above because I do like it. I also want to take broader examples. 

57
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:28,550
So we're going to search the internet. So what we're looking at here is just getting 

58
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:32,590
the generalized idea of high converting video adds 

59
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:38,120
and making it available that we might use as a second brain with inside the agent 

60
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,160
that we're building.

61
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,650
So looking through this, this is perfect. We've got structural rules. We've got six 

62
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:48,370
different types coming through. Here we go a bit further down. We've got psychology 

63
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:54,450
rules and we've got hook formulas. What I'd like to do with this now is maybe identify 

64
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:59,530
variables that we could use. So this can be the second brain for sure. In the AI 

65
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:04,810
agent. We're probably also want to load it up with a bunch of successful adverts 

66
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:08,610
that we create over time, but we can't do that until we build them. But for now, 

67
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:13,770
let's just see if we can write a little prompt here that identifies variables that 

68
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:18,170
might be useful for an end user using this particular tool.

69
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:23,440
Now this information is going to be perfect for building the forms for the AI agent, 

70
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:29,200
but to simplify it, I think I just need a tabular grid that shows the variable name. 

71
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:34,680
Maybe the type of data. Is it a drop down list or a text box? Maybe some examples. 

72
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:40,240
So we'll just put in a prompt here and we'll just see how this goes at generating 

73
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:46,120
that information. So it's talking about the idea of variables being in lowercase 

74
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:51,920
snakecase. So you can see that down the left we've got a label a type of input and 

75
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:56,760
some example values. So when I go over to the AI agent builder 

76
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,770
the tool I'm going to use is Pickaxe, then I'm going to have all the variables and 

77
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:03,50
values that we can just fill in.

78
00:06:03,60 --> 00:06:07,590
Now, one of the problems with the list of variables that are being created is that 

79
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:12,230
they're too fine grained. It would make the tool too hard to use, and it would be 

80
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:16,830
too constrained, because you've got to put in a little bit of information about every 

81
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:22,150
sort of variable. So what I've done is just written one more prompt to just reduce 

82
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:27,550
it down to five different variables, just the highest level ones going on, plus a 

83
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:32,510
custom instruction for if something else is needed. Apart from that, we now need 

84
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:37,430
to develop a prompt and a role. So we'll just paste in this little prompt here. This 

85
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:42,110
is about developing the role for the AI agent. And let's see what we get.

86
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:48,330
This is perfect. And I add agent that generates high converting scroll stopping video 

87
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:49,290
ad scripts. 

88
00:06:49,30 --> 00:06:51,390
Next we'll do a description.

89
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:56,540
The last piece in the puzzle is we're going to need a prompt. So I've just put in 

90
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:03,540
this meta prompt. It'll generate a prompt that is for high converting video ad generator. 

91
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:08,540
We've got a bunch of information. We've got the input variables coming through. So 

92
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:14,100
we should be able to use this pretty much as it is inside our AI agent. 

93
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:18,940
Now we'll head over to Pickaxe and we'll start filling in this agent, and we'll use 

94
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:24,460
a lot of the information that we just developed. So the first area I want is a name 

95
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:29,780
for the agent. And I've asked for a name that is keyword rich rather than branding 

96
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:35,500
rich, because I want people to be able to find this in a marketplace. So the one 

97
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:41,420
I think I'll go with is the hook based video script tool. And we can just go up here 

98
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:46,620
and paste it in. The next area we should look for is the role that we talked about 

99
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,100
earlier. 

100
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:52,730
So we developed a role right here. And we can just take that particular information 

101
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:55,890
and head over to the role and paste it in.

102
00:07:55,890 --> 00:08:00,800
The next area we want to work on is this prompt, and we've already got a partial 

103
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:06,520
set up for it. We have the main instructions. We understand what the input variables 

104
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:11,400
are. Now I'm going to rename this to Input Variable guidelines. And then after that 

105
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:16,640
I want to supply the actual user input variables. And then finally I want to have 

106
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:22,520
output instructions. So I've just reframed that information into a code block right 

107
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:27,240
here. One of the things that you can notice is that the user supplied inputs are 

108
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:32,80
all ready to go. So we'll just click on copy code here and we'll paste that right 

109
00:08:32,80 --> 00:08:37,720
in here. Now with that in place what we can do is work on changing the actual input 

110
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,560
variables.

111
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,970
Now, with the prompt in place, what we can do is add user input anywhere we like. 

112
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:48,770
So I'm just going to double click on this value and say add user input and we'll 

113
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:53,610
see a new field. Now for the actual title, this is where we'll just come back up 

114
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:57,370
here and select the information and paste it in. 

115
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:01,210
this will be the instruction field that people will see on the form. And then we 

116
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:04,170
can just go through and repeat it for each variable.

117
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:09,220
So now on the left we have our complete prompt. We've got all our user inputs. When 

118
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:13,540
you click on them that'll take you to the field over on the right. Now if there's 

119
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:17,980
anything you want to change around the structure, and I think custom instructions 

120
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:23,460
is the main one we'll change is that we'll go from short answer to long answer. We 

121
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:28,460
should be able to put in 1000 characters right there. Now this is not required, but 

122
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:33,380
we might make all the others required because without them you're losing a bit of 

123
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:36,660
the energy. So we'll just make them all required.

124
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:42,740
Now this is a free text box so you can put any value in there. But it might be useful 

125
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:47,20
also to have a sample. Now we could put the information

126
00:09:47,30 --> 00:09:50,970
directly into the field like this. I'll just paste that in. And you can see that 

127
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:55,930
there's multiple values and they'll be overridable. But for this example there is 

128
00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:00,450
very short. I might just put them in as part of the heading.

129
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:06,70
Now here we have our configuration updated. The custom instruction is long. Each 

130
00:10:06,70 --> 00:10:11,710
of the different fields that we want to fill in are also supplied with some examples 

131
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:16,750
in the heading. And the way this looks now is that we've got the custom instruction 

132
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:23,230
hook type. You can type in shock or for the pain target we could put bad technique 

133
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:26,710
or something like that. And the good thing about this is that if you want to use 

134
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,470
a different value, you can.

135
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:33,850
Now, what I would like to do is test out this Pickaxe. And what we can do is click 

136
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:38,890
save and it will take us back to the main screen where we can click on the preview 

137
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:44,330
button. So if we come up here, you can see how you can open it up in a new window.

138
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:50,10
And our configured hook based video script is here. We can fill in all the values 

139
00:10:50,50 --> 00:10:52,850
and press submit. So let's test it out.

140
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:58,310
So let's fill in a few example fields. So we've got the hook type humor shock or 

141
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:03,870
curiosity. I'm going to go with shock. After that is what do we think we want to 

142
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:08,750
get the audience member to feel in this case just emotional failure. They've tried 

143
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:12,670
to do something, but they've failed at it in the past. Maybe this is something we 

144
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:17,670
can tap into. Then who is the villain in the story? Could be themselves. It could 

145
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:21,670
be some sort of guru that they've learned from. I'm going to go with themselves. 

146
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:27,190
And then what do we want to show them is going to come through if they follow through 

147
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:32,310
on the offer? So maybe it's a mini framework. Maybe it's the contrast of before and 

148
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:32,310
after 

149
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:37,190
So then the call to action. Do you want to send them to an offer. Maybe a community 

150
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:39,310
with this will go with a direct offer.

151
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:43,700
Now, in this case, I don't want it to randomly come up with a story. I want to have 

152
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:48,460
some sort of character that we're working towards. So we'll just dictate for a second 

153
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,260
and we'll go.

154
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:54,810
You are a freelance video editor. You're pretty good at creating videos, but for 

155
00:11:54,810 --> 00:12:00,810
some reason the content never seems to engage, and you suspect that the issue is 

156
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:05,410
with your script writing. And you're wondering, is there a tool out there that can 

157
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:09,490
produce beautiful scripts for YouTube every time?

158
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:14,590
Now let's say there's something custom, maybe a custom avatar or some other sorts 

159
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:18,590
of style that you want to introduce. Then you can use the custom instruction. And 

160
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:23,740
what I've done is I've gone over to ChatGPT, and I've asked questions about 18 to 

161
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:29,150
30 year old men, and it's come up with a good set of information that I can just 

162
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:35,430
take and paste directly into the custom instruction to frame and shape the script 

163
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:36,950
to meet this criteria.

164
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:42,190
So with everything filled in, we can just come down and click the submit button. 

165
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:46,710
And what I'll do is that agent will start processing using a large language 

166
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,450
We're using ChatGPT, for a mini.

167
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:53,500
So it's quickly written a script for us. It starts off with a line. Ever felt like 

168
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:57,700
your videos are just meh? Now, to test this out properly, what I'll do is I'll just 

169
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:02,980
add it to 11 labs and do some basic graphics just to get a feel for what this script 

170
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:03,900
could look like.

171
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:09,170
Ever feel like your videos are just man, you're editing your heart out, but it's 

172
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:15,690
like no one even notices. What gives? Real talk. It's not your fault you're stuck 

173
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:21,290
in the loop of outdated advice. The problem? Your scripts are missing that spark. 

174
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:25,410
But what if I told you there's a mini framework that changes everything?

175
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:31,450
Picture this. Killer scripts that hook viewers in seconds. Yeah, it's totally doable.

178
00:13:42,80 --> 00:13:46,120
next video, we're going to take it to the next level. But one of the things that 

179
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:50,440
you would have noticed in that video was that it was put together really quickly. 

180
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:56,440
There is actually a call to action there to the AI. TLDR YouTube channel, where you 

181
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:00,160
can actually learn how to do this yourself. There is a course that we're putting 

182
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:06,00
