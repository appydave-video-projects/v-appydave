00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:05,360
In this quick video, I'll show you how to host N8N on DigitalOcean. I'll also show 

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:10,310
you how you can get two months of credits so that you can use it through the testing 

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:15,470
phase. Look at a couple of challenges I had when getting it set up, and just finally, 

4
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:21,00
how I've hooked it up to a little micro application to do AI agent workflows. At 

5
00:00:21,00 --> 00:00:23,120
the end, I'm AppyDave. Let's get into it.

6
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:29,280
So let's get started setting up N8N on DigitalOcean. Now, the first thing to realize 

7
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:35,280
is that the starting price of a droplet is about 4 USD a month. The one we'll work 

8
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,430
with is around $6 a month. But at the moment, if you click on the link down below, 

9
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:46,150
you'll get $200 worth of credits that you can use over the next 60 days. So no matter 

10
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,670
what workload you're under, you're probably going to have it for free for the next 

11
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:51,480
two months.

12
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,400
Now when you use that link, it should take you directly to DigitalOcean and you should 

13
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,280
get a $200 credit.

14
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,400
So we'll click on Get Started 

15
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,190
From there I'm going to sign up with an email 

16
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:08,910
We've press create. It's given us the $200 credit. We just need to verify our email 

17
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:09,190
address.

18
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:12,790
Fill in a little bit of marketing information here if you want to.

19
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:17,590
Now, because this is a new onboarding, we come up with these options. We could pick 

20
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:22,150
deploy a virtual machine. But in this case we're just going to go to explore the 

21
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,110
control panel.

22
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:27,150
Now we already have our first project. We do want to create a new one, but before 

23
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:31,910
we can do that, we need to deal with this action needed. So we'll click on the billing 

24
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:32,550
right here.

25
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:36,350
We won't have any prepayment because of the credits that we've added, but we are 

26
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:42,470
going to need to add a payment method. So we've successfully added a payment mechanism.

27
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:46,870
And now we've got 59 days and $200 remaining credit.

28
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:52,30
So let's head up to the projects menu and we can create a new project.

29
00:01:52,30 --> 00:01:57,510
And I've just called it N8N server. It's hosting Nadine Workflows and my use case 

30
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:02,990
is for APIs and service oriented architecture. So we'll just create the server.

31
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:07,510
Now I don't currently have an app or a droplet, so I'm just going to click Skip for 

32
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:07,750
now.

33
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:12,790
So at this point, what we need to do is install a droplet. We also have to configure 

34
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:17,590
N8N. And we're going to use a really simple technique. So what we do is we come back 

35
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:22,750
to our server and we spin up a droplet. And we need to decide where we're going to 

36
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:27,510
run it. Now this is for an Australian client. So I'm going to pick Sydney. And as 

37
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:31,830
we scroll down you have these computers that you can select. But we don't want to 

38
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:36,710
do it that way. We want to go with the marketplace instead. Now when you go to marketplace 

39
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:40,870
you'll have all these preloaded Docker images that you can work with. One of them 

40
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:46,550
is called N8N. Now if you can't see it there, you can at least type in N8N like this. 

41
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:50,990
Click on the button here. It'll become available. Now when you move down, you'll 

42
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:53,70
be able to set a size of the.

43
00:02:53,70 --> 00:02:57,790
Based on this image, we'll go to regular and we'll go to $6 a month.

44
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:02,870
Now, as we scroll down, what we'll notice is that there are other settings we can 

45
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:07,150
go with. There's a password which we will fill in in a moment. And then down the 

46
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:11,710
bottom there's the create droplet. One of the things that we do need to change is 

47
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:16,790
the host name. So I'm going to call it N8N droplet. And then we're going to come 

48
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:22,70
up to the password. And I've put in a pretty strong password. We can now create the 

49
00:03:22,70 --> 00:03:27,390
droplet. Now it'll start spinning it up right here. And when this is finished the 

50
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:28,950
IP address will show.

51
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:35,310
Now we can see it's Sydney, one gigabyte, 25GB of disk space. This is the IP address. 

52
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,430
We're just going to click copy on that.

53
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:42,670
And the reason we did that is we now need to configure an A record. Now I'm using 

54
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:48,30
Cloudflare. So I'll head over to Cloudflare and I'll scroll down and press add a 

55
00:03:48,30 --> 00:03:54,510
new record. From here I'll select type A, I'm going to put it in as N8N, and I'll 

56
00:03:54,510 --> 00:04:00,590
put in the IP address right here and press save. Now with my subdomain in place we 

57
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:05,670
can come back and click on these three little dots here. This is going to give us 

58
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:10,790
access to the console. So the first thing you'll do is you will click on the launch 

59
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,150
console right here.

60
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:18,350
And if the A record is propagated, this should work. So we'll put in n a to n, we'll 

61
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:21,910
put in a domain name and everything will work.

62
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:27,110
And if we get a error message like this, then we just need to wait for the a record 

63
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:27,870
to propagate.

64
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:33,470
So a particular issue you might also want to check is this proxy value. You do want 

65
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:34,230
it turned on but 

66
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:36,470
to turn it off here. Hit save on that.

67
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:41,830
Now, once that's registered, if you come and you see a page like this one and in 

68
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:46,270
my case, I have a brand new domain name. So there's a little bit of a history issue 

69
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:51,270
with Google. What we can do is go and click on the. Let us know that this page is 

70
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:56,270
safe. We can say this page is safe as the report type. We've got the domain name. 

71
00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:02,150
We can say it is a new domain, something like that. We'll hit submit. Now there is 

72
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:05,590
another way that you can do it. There's a little button here and that'll take you 

73
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:11,270
over to the transparency report. And from there we can paste in the URL right here. 

74
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:17,790
And so now when we put in our domain name and we run it, we should get N8N running. 

75
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,830
And you can now create a new account.

76
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:22,470
I've just filled in the marketing material here. 

77
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:26,560
And then just put in your email address to get a license key.

78
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:32,270
The activation key will come in an email. Go over to settings. And then you can click 

79
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,710
here to enter the activation key.

80
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:38,950
I'm now activated. We can go back and from here we can create workflows.

81
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:45,270
Now, I've been doing the N8N workflows so that I can build in backend AI functionality, 

82
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:50,110
and the idea is that I should be able to put information into this little application 

83
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:55,950
that I'm building, and then when I press next, it's now talking to N8N directly to 

84
00:05:56,00 --> 00:06:01,310
get a bunch of related questions to an incident that just happened. And then people 

85
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:06,270
can go and fill in extra information. So that's how I'm using N8N workflows.

86
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:12,550
So that's how you host N8N on DigitalOcean. And all of this came about because recently 

87
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:18,230
I did a video on Vibe coding landing pages for websites such as the one that you're 

88
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:23,190
seeing right here. And from there I went into a more detailed context engineering 

89
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:29,150
example on building an application. So if you want to see how I'm building this application, 

90
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:34,310
how as I load it in with different information, and I'm using the live button here 

91
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:40,670
to talk directly to the N8N workflows that we just created. We can see this information 

92
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:46,30
hitting that server and coming up with dynamic questions based on the information 

93
00:06:46,30 --> 00:06:50,510
earlier in this form. Anyway, I'm AppyDave. Please like and subscribe and I'll see 

94
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,590
you in the next video.
