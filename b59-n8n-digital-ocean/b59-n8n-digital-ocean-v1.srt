1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,333
In this quick video, I'll show you how to host N8N on DigitalOcean. I'll also show 

2
00:00:05,333 --> 00:00:10,300
you how you can get two months of credits so that you can use it through the testing 

3
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:15,466
phase. Look at a couple of challenges I had when getting it set up, and just finally, 

4
00:00:15,466 --> 00:00:21,000
how I've hooked it up to a little micro application to do AI agent workflows. At 

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,100
the end, I'm AppyDave. Let's get into it.

6
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:29,266
So let's get started setting up N8N on DigitalOcean. Now, the first thing to realize 

7
00:00:29,266 --> 00:00:35,266
is that the starting price of a droplet is about 4 USD a month. The one we'll work 

8
00:00:35,266 --> 00:00:40,400
with is around $6 a month. But at the moment, if you click on the link down below, 

9
00:00:40,466 --> 00:00:46,133
you'll get $200 worth of credits that you can use over the next 60 days. So no matter 

10
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,666
what workload you're under, you're probably going to have it for free for the next 

11
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:51,466
two months.

12
00:00:51,466 --> 00:00:56,400
Now when you use that link, it should take you directly to DigitalOcean and you should 

13
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,266
get a $200 credit.

14
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:03,166
So we'll click on Get Started 
From there I'm going to sign up with an email 

15
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:08,900
We've press create. It's given us the $200 credit. We just need to verify our email 

16
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:09,166
address.

17
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:12,766
Fill in a little bit of marketing information here if you want to.

18
00:01:12,766 --> 00:01:17,566
Now, because this is a new onboarding, we come up with these options. We could pick 

19
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,133
deploy a virtual machine. But in this case we're just going to go to explore the 

20
00:01:22,133 --> 00:01:23,100
control panel.

21
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,133
Now we already have our first project. We do want to create a new one, but before 

22
00:01:27,133 --> 00:01:31,900
we can do that, we need to deal with this action needed. So we'll click on the billing 

23
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:32,533
right here.

24
00:01:32,533 --> 00:01:36,333
We won't have any prepayment because of the credits that we've added, but we are 

25
00:01:36,366 --> 00:01:42,466
going to need to add a payment method. So we've successfully added a payment mechanism.

26
00:01:42,466 --> 00:01:46,866
And now we've got 59 days and $200 remaining credit.

27
00:01:46,866 --> 00:01:52,000
So let's head up to the projects menu and we can create a new project.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,500
And I've just called it N8N server. It's hosting Nadine Workflows and my use case 

29
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:02,966
is for APIs and service oriented architecture. So we'll just create the server.

30
00:02:02,966 --> 00:02:07,500
Now I don't currently have an app or a droplet, so I'm just going to click Skip for 

31
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:07,733
now.

32
00:02:07,733 --> 00:02:12,766
So at this point, what we need to do is install a droplet. We also have to configure 

33
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,566
N8N. And we're going to use a really simple technique. So what we do is we come back 

34
00:02:17,566 --> 00:02:22,733
to our server and we spin up a droplet. And we need to decide where we're going to 

35
00:02:22,733 --> 00:02:27,500
run it. Now this is for an Australian client. So I'm going to pick Sydney. And as 

36
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,800
we scroll down you have these computers that you can select. But we don't want to 

37
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,700
do it that way. We want to go with the marketplace instead. Now when you go to marketplace 

38
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:40,866
you'll have all these preloaded Docker images that you can work with. One of them 

39
00:02:40,866 --> 00:02:46,533
is called N8N. Now if you can't see it there, you can at least type in N8N like this. 

40
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:50,966
Click on the button here. It'll become available. Now when you move down, you'll 

41
00:02:50,966 --> 00:02:53,066
be able to set a size of the.

42
00:02:53,066 --> 00:02:57,766
Based on this image, we'll go to regular and we'll go to $6 a month.

43
00:02:57,766 --> 00:03:02,866
Now, as we scroll down, what we'll notice is that there are other settings we can 

44
00:03:02,866 --> 00:03:07,133
go with. There's a password which we will fill in in a moment. And then down the 

45
00:03:07,133 --> 00:03:11,700
bottom there's the create droplet. One of the things that we do need to change is 

46
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:16,766
the host name. So I'm going to call it N8N droplet. And then we're going to come 

47
00:03:16,766 --> 00:03:22,066
up to the password. And I've put in a pretty strong password. We can now create the 

48
00:03:22,066 --> 00:03:27,366
droplet. Now it'll start spinning it up right here. And when this is finished the 

49
00:03:27,366 --> 00:03:28,933
IP address will show.

50
00:03:28,933 --> 00:03:35,300
Now we can see it's Sydney, one gigabyte, 25GB of disk space. This is the IP address. 

51
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,400
We're just going to click copy on that.

52
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:42,666
And the reason we did that is we now need to configure an A record. Now I'm using 

53
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:48,000
Cloudflare. So I'll head over to Cloudflare and I'll scroll down and press add a 

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,500
new record. From here I'll select type A, I'm going to put it in as N8N, and I'll 

55
00:03:54,500 --> 00:04:00,566
put in the IP address right here and press save. Now with my subdomain in place we 

56
00:04:00,566 --> 00:04:05,666
can come back and click on these three little dots here. This is going to give us 

57
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:10,766
access to the console. So the first thing you'll do is you will click on the launch 

58
00:04:10,766 --> 00:04:12,133
console right here.

59
00:04:12,133 --> 00:04:18,333
And if the A record is propagated, this should work. So we'll put in n a to n, we'll 

60
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:21,900
put in a domain name and everything will work.

61
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:27,100
And if we get a error message like this, then we just need to wait for the a record 

62
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:27,866
to propagate.

63
00:04:27,866 --> 00:04:33,466
So a particular issue you might also want to check is this proxy value. You do want 

64
00:04:33,466 --> 00:04:34,200
it turned on but 

65
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,466
to turn it off here. Hit save on that.

66
00:04:36,466 --> 00:04:41,800
Now, once that's registered, if you come and you see a page like this one and in 

67
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,266
my case, I have a brand new domain name. So there's a little bit of a history issue 

68
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:51,266
with Google. What we can do is go and click on the. Let us know that this page is 

69
00:04:51,266 --> 00:04:56,266
safe. We can say this page is safe as the report type. We've got the domain name. 

70
00:04:56,266 --> 00:05:02,133
We can say it is a new domain, something like that. We'll hit submit. Now there is 

71
00:05:02,133 --> 00:05:05,566
another way that you can do it. There's a little button here and that'll take you 

72
00:05:05,566 --> 00:05:11,266
over to the transparency report. And from there we can paste in the URL right here. 

73
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:17,766
And so now when we put in our domain name and we run it, we should get N8N running. 

74
00:05:17,766 --> 00:05:19,800
And you can now create a new account.

75
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,466
I've just filled in the marketing material here. 

76
00:05:22,466 --> 00:05:32,266
And then just put in your email address to get a license key.
The activation key will come in an email. Go over to settings. And then you can click 

77
00:05:32,266 --> 00:05:34,700
here to enter the activation key.

78
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:38,933
I'm now activated. We can go back and from here we can create workflows.

79
00:05:38,933 --> 00:05:45,266
Now, I've been doing the N8N workflows so that I can build in backend AI functionality, 

80
00:05:45,266 --> 00:05:50,100
and the idea is that I should be able to put information into this little application 

81
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:55,933
that I'm building, and then when I press next, it's now talking to N8N directly to 

82
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,300
get a bunch of related questions to an incident that just happened. And then people 

83
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:06,266
can go and fill in extra information. So that's how I'm using N8N workflows.

84
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:12,533
So that's how you host N8N on DigitalOcean. And all of this came about because recently 

85
00:06:12,533 --> 00:06:18,200
I did a video on Vibe coding landing pages for websites such as the one that you're 

86
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:23,166
seeing right here. And from there I went into a more detailed context engineering 

87
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:29,133
example on building an application. So if you want to see how I'm building this application, 

88
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:34,300
how as I load it in with different information, and I'm using the live button here 

89
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:40,666
to talk directly to the N8N workflows that we just created. We can see this information 

90
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:46,000
hitting that server and coming up with dynamic questions based on the information 

91
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,500
earlier in this form. Anyway, I'm AppyDave. Please like and subscribe and I'll see 

92
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,566
you in the next video.
