00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:04,830
Many people are wondering whether OpenAI, Codex or Claude Code is the way to go. 

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:09,950
In this video, I'm going to explore how you could be using them both together and 

3
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:15,30
how I'm also doing that to manage some of the costs I'm AppyDave let's get into it.

4
00:00:15,30 --> 00:00:19,870
Yesterday, I found myself doing a fair bit of coding on some internal tools that 

5
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:24,960
I use and doing a lot of refactoring, and I realized I wanted to make sure that the 

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:31,320
tools were updated on Ruby Gems, which is like node packages or Python packages. 

7
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:37,560
And with that, I also wanted to do an extensive refactor where I used Claude Code 

8
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:44,320
as the main creator and OpenAI Codex to just check on the quality of the code being 

9
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,70
created.

10
00:00:45,70 --> 00:00:51,70
Now I have a second goal for using Codex with Claude Code, and that's all about managing 

11
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:57,510
token usage. So if we go over to Claude Code and we look at the usage down here, 

12
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:03,890
we can see all the current models. I've used 33% of my usage. I've got about 3 or 

13
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:09,840
4 days to go before it runs out. Now I should be fine, but on a daily basis I'm working 

14
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:16,00
on 2 or 3 projects at the same time. I keep shifting between tabs. To do that, and 

15
00:01:16,00 --> 00:01:21,310
I'll be coding for 6 to 12 hours. And when you're doing that all the time, you can 

16
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:26,430
really run through your tokens. So I thought, could I start another session? And 

17
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:33,560
this is the one we're seeing down here, specifically using Codex to not do my coding, 

18
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,430
but to check that my coding is actually any good.

19
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:40,900
So while I was coding with Claude Code, I had this little conversation going on. 

20
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:46,60
Essentially, it was just watching the repo. From time to time. I'd constantly be 

21
00:01:46,90 --> 00:01:50,990
tweaking the conversation. It had read individual files, understand the structure 

22
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:54,850
as it was going on. It was creating its own documentation 

23
00:01:54,850 --> 00:02:00,230
called Codex Documentation. After a while, I would ask it to look at new commits 

24
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:05,710
that were coming through. I'd ask it to keep focusing on the idea that it was about 

25
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:10,870
patterns and best, best practices, and that it would have to delegate or hand off 

26
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:16,120
the document to Claude Code. So it would be important that it included the line numbers 

27
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,940
as well as the descriptions of what was going on. 

28
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:22,960
So with simple tweaks along the way, it would just keep itself up to date. 

29
00:02:23,20 --> 00:02:28,750
And so at the end of it, I had a well reasoned document of recommendations. They 

30
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:34,330
had a priority map, it had line numbers, it had descriptions. So I thought, let's 

31
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:37,570
aim this at Claude Code and see what it thinks.

32
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:43,130
So if we go back to our terminals, we've got our Codex here. We've got the actual 

33
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:48,810
help file from some of the tools that are being used here. And if I pop up to a different 

34
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:55,270
terminal, I've got the start of the analysis of the Codex recommendations by Claude 

35
00:02:55,270 --> 00:03:00,690
Code. And because this particular conversation has a lot of historical context 

36
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:06,250
about the work it's been executing, but also its own lessons and learnings. 

37
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:12,130
it has a really good perspective on if someone else tells it, what is the right way 

38
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:17,740
to go of saying yes, that is. Or no, it's not because I've actually solved this problem 

39
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,650
a different way.

40
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:24,850
Claude Code is reading the comprehensive analysis, and it's making its own assessment, 

41
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:29,90
and it's doing it in the conversation where it's already got a lot of knowledge. 

42
00:03:29,90 --> 00:03:34,780
And the first thing it realises is that the information about linting or cops in 

43
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:39,460
this particular case is out of date, because it's already done a whole lot of work 

44
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:45,650
there. The next thing is it's looking at the configuration adapters at Codex is putting 

45
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:50,780
in place. So this is a level of abstraction meant to improve the system. But we've 

46
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:57,10
already got really good usage of the singleton pattern for the configuration. We've 

47
00:03:57,10 --> 00:04:03,570
also got dependency injection for individual tools, configuration and test data, 

48
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:09,300
which is useful during the unit test phase. So a lot of the stuff that's here is 

49
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,60
good to know about, but not something we need to implement.

50
00:04:12,50 --> 00:04:17,810
Scenario number three was really interesting. Codex wants us to get rid of a lot 

51
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:22,410
of the logging, and what Claude Code has pointed out is that this is not a library. 

52
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:29,330
This is a CLI tool where the logging is actually useful as you user feedback. And 

53
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:33,810
it's come up with a counter proposal, which is interesting, but I don't plan to use 

54
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:38,170
this as a library. So I'm going to say no to this particular recommendation.

55
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:43,60
And so now we're at the fifth proposal and it's talking about the method missing 

56
00:04:43,60 --> 00:04:48,820
and wanting to harden this code. Make it more explicit. But this is actually a flexible 

57
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,430
configuration system that can dynamically, 

58
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:54,70
change to suit new circumstances. 

59
00:04:54,70 --> 00:04:58,630
So this is not a correct pattern for us to implement. So this one I'm going to decline. 

60
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:03,160
So you can see here in Claude code, it's asked what do we wanna do? It's come up 

61
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,120
with the same idea that Proposal-3 is the only thing we should work with. It has 

62
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,60
other options, but I've just ridden my own ideas here and said that Proposal-0 or 

63
00:05:12,60 --> 00:05:17,170
Proposal-1, we won't do Proposal-2 is a good idea, but it doesn't make sense because 

64
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:18,70
we're in a purely 

65
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,460
UX environment. It's all interactive. 

66
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:26,620
Proposal-4 is going to be declined. But Proposal-3 is what we do want to implement. 

67
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:31,480
I've also said that it needs to clean up this document. It needs to make sure when 

68
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:35,920
it cleans it up, that it does it in a way that Codex knows what's happened. It's 

69
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,450
also going to give its reasons, it's rationales. So with that, we can just press 

70
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:46,120
enter and let Claude code do the changes we want, which is make some new coding improvements 

71
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:52,60
and update this document so that Codex is informed of summaries and verdicts.

72
00:05:52,60 --> 00:05:56,650
Now Claude Code has claimed that it's finished the work it needed to do. It's successful, 

73
00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:00,250
it's given the recommendations back to, 

74
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,00
Codex. 

75
00:06:01,00 --> 00:06:06,760
one of the things that's said is that it's a little bit dogmatic, so it's given new 

76
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:11,920
information pretty much the same as what it did just rewritten. And as it says, Codex 

77
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:16,750
will understand what's implemented, what was rejected, and why the decisions were 

78
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:21,940
made. Now, if we go and look at the code changes from a unit testing point of view, 

79
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:26,500
we can see that everything is working, but there are some problems. So it might be 

80
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:31,390
useful to go and solve them as we go. So we'll just come back to Claude code, 

81
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:35,950
and I've just put in this little statement, can you resolve the linting issues so 

82
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:41,710
as it changes code, the information on the right here should start to refresh and 

83
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,310
update. 

84
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:45,700
One of the great things about this is that you'll see the errors coming through, 

85
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,790
and then you'll see it all get resolved pretty quickly. 

86
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:51,970
so we've got our tests being updated automatically, 

87
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:57,280
so we can see in the left hand side that the linting issues have been resolved. And 

88
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,30
in the right hand side we've got proof or evidence that it's happened.

89
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:08,910
So that's one of the ways I'm using Claude Code and Codex from OpenAI together, just 

90
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:15,150
to use the strengths that they've got. It's also an example of how to be more cost 

91
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:21,870
effective. So I can use OpenAI Codex at times when I might want to use Claude opus 

92
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:27,790
model, and it can just run in the background. It's running off my $25 team plan, 

93
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:31,470
whereas Claude Code is running off my $100 max plan.

94
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:36,590
So this is allowing me to use different models for different reasons, but also keep 

95
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:41,550
my costs under control. Now I have a community, so if you're interested in learning 

96
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:46,430
more about how I do the prompt engineering, especially using context engineering 

97
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:51,270
frameworks like BMAD method, then click on the link in the description. Otherwise, 

98
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:54,310
I'll see you in the next video. I'm AppyDave. See you soon!
