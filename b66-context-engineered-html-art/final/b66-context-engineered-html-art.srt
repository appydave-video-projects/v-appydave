00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:06,900
Are you interested in creating art with AI but you don't want to use VEO-3 orSORA-2? 

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,830
You're not really interested in the generative AI. You want to go back to old school 

3
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:16,510
techniques like using programming, maybe games development. In this video, we're 

4
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:21,390
going to use context engineering to do a little bit of artwork and then potentially 

5
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:26,350
show some business use cases where we might project it directly onto a building. 

6
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:28,280
I'm AppyDave let's get into it.

7
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:33,530
I've learned a thing or two about AI art generation. I even have a faceless YouTube 

8
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:39,280
channel where I explore concepts like avatars and face swaps. And we've got all sorts 

9
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,320
of tutorials that have been written, 

10
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:47,240
on how to do animations and video creation. In fact, I've even got from about a year 

11
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:52,490
ago, a fancy video that I put together for 90 seconds. I'll just let that play. Legends 

12
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:58,280
are forged in the fires of the YouTube battlefield. Only the strongest, the most 

13
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,920
persistent, the most clickbait driven warriors will survive 

14
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:10,210
that's a little video that I did about a year ago for a presentation, and I've loved 

15
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:16,150
what we've been able to do with AI Art and video movie creation. But in this video, 

16
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:21,970
I wanna focus more on a different style of art that can be really useful for generating 

17
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:27,10
graphics for your videos. It can be used as something that you can project onto a 

18
00:01:27,10 --> 00:01:29,00
building, do advertising. 

19
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:32,110
and the way we're going to do it is just write 

20
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:36,940
a couple of little programs quickly using context engineering. And we are going to 

21
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:38,860
do it simply using Claude Code.

22
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:44,220
So what I've done is set up a simple environment for us to start our project. I've 

23
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:49,140
got Visual Studio and I've just got a terminal and in it I'm going to just start 

24
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:54,310
writing Claude Code. And this is using Claude Code from the command line. Now, the 

25
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:59,260
good thing about Claude Code, it's relatively easy to use once you get through a 

26
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:04,660
few basic hurdles, and once you've got it going, you can run it within Visual Studio 

27
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:09,430
yourself. Or I like to run it from the command line like this. And I think we'll 

28
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:12,870
just start off with a basic context prompt to get us going.

29
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:17,600
So with a little starter prompt, I've just said, this conversation will be about 

30
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,560
generating AI art, 

31
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,810
things like word clouds, polygons, all the sort of computer graphics that you might 

32
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:27,780
see in a game. For example. What we'll do is 

33
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,400
we'll just tell it up front that we're going to do a little bit of prompt engineering. 

34
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,150
We're gonna have to do a little bit of research on styles, and then ultimately it's 

35
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:41,640
about building micro requirements documents and little applications that can just 

36
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:48,300
run in the browser, some sort of HTML, JavaScript, et cetera. Now with this, I'm 

37
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:53,00
just giving it a little bit of pre-contact and then I'm probably just going to write 

38
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,620
in it. And this is just going 

39
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:01,620
to build a Claude MD file, which is basically like a system prompt for this particular 

40
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,180
project. 

41
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:07,710
So the good thing here is we've got a bunch of tech stack options we could work with. 

42
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:13,800
We've also got some popular techniques and it's just reading the folder structure. 

43
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,240
And remember there wasn't much going on at the beginning. We've got a very empty 

44
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,450
setup, but in a moment we will have a Claude md. 

45
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:27,140
So the CLAUD.MD file has been created. We'll just click on that. We can read it this 

46
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:32,960
way, or we can put it into a markdown preview. Just makes it a little bit easier 

47
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:38,480
to understand what it thinks it needs as a starting point. So this concept, do the 

48
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,680
NPM run Dev probably isn't going to be needed. I don't know that we're going to run 

49
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,980
applications from NPM just yet. 

50
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:50,840
we'll we'll see as we go, but we've got a starting document to get going with our 

51
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,560
process.

52
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,970
So one of the interesting things when we are doing prompt engineering or context 

53
00:03:55,970 --> 00:04:02,00
engineering is that when you give a starting statement and then you end up with ideas 

54
00:04:02,00 --> 00:04:08,180
on how it's going to run, it's got ideas on the technology stack. It's becoming a 

55
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,590
little bit prescriptive. 

56
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:15,80
it's said, this is what we'll use, but I want a little be a little bit more artistic 

57
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:19,760
and free flowing. So what we'll do is we'll just put in an additional prompt that 

58
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,320
says, this is great. 

59
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,870
but one of the problems I have with the Claude file at the moment 

60
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:30,930
it's already decided on NPM and tech stacks. And what I want it to do is just be 

61
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:36,380
a little bit more free flowing in its thinking. And this is really just going to 

62
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:39,180
modify the system prompt slightly 

63
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:44,220
because while all this information like the tech stack is great, we don't really 

64
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,340
want to set that in stone right now. 

65
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:51,780
So now things have changed in a really positive fashion. We've got common techniques, 

66
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:52,350
generative, 

67
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:56,700
animation techniques and visual effects. We got a little bit of a coding structure 

68
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,240
going on.

69
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,520
So we can see it's modified a lot of the document. Basically it's removed the prescriptive 

70
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:08,80
text stack. We've got no architectures. We've removed code examples. And we're just 

71
00:05:08,80 --> 00:05:10,200
emphasizing that this is 

72
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,870
an experimental and discovery session. 

73
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:17,950
so when we go back and have a look at our CLAUDE file, it's a much simpler document. 

74
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,830
And this will be the system prompt as we move forward.

75
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:26,750
So let's move into this experimentation and research phase. And I've just started 

76
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:31,510
a little prompt here that says, I want to create artwork that's animated. It has 

77
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:37,00
bold contrasting colors, and I wanna make sure it's designed for use with a projector. 

78
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:42,460
Now this could either be for wall art in a city, it could be for shop art, it could 

79
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:47,650
be for advertising in a shop. So we'll let it just start running and do a little 

80
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:48,760
bit of research 

81
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:52,390
on different techniques that would work. And you'd notice that the first thing it 

82
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:56,80
starts doing is searching the internet for ideas. 

83
00:05:56,80 --> 00:06:00,970
Now, just point out that when you're using a terminal, it's a little bit different 

84
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:08,380
to using chat GPT or Claude in the websites in that it doesn't look quite as nice, 

85
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,880
but it's still fairly easy once you get the idea of it. But it has this benefit that 

86
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:18,220
it can read and write from files directly on your system. So any sort of context 

87
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:24,130
or what I would call a document island is really easy to create, really easy to reference.

88
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:29,180
So it's written up a research document for us. I've just put in a prompt to ask it 

89
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:33,940
to write that research into the dots folder for us. But let's have a quick look. 

90
00:06:34,00 --> 00:06:36,70
We've basically got five 

91
00:06:36,70 --> 00:06:41,560
graphic systems, I guess. So we've got the neo brutalist geo metric morphing. I've 

92
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:46,210
no idea what that is. We've got kinetic topography. This could be really good for 

93
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:53,360
advertising. We've got liquid fluid gradient animation, so we, and maybe stuff using 

94
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,880
various gradients could be good. And then we've got a particle system. They're always 

95
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:03,400
interesting and we've got anamorphic 3D illusion, so I'd be interested to see whether 

96
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:08,500
that's around silhouettes or stuff like that. Silhouettes are a style of art that 

97
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,650
I like using in business animations, 

98
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:16,490
and if that isn't what that is, we can always add it in later. So at the moment, 

99
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:21,370
it's writing out a document for us. Let's see what's happened in Visual Studio. We've 

100
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:26,320
got a dots folder. We can go and have a look at what it's written and we've got all 

101
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:31,60
our information ready to go. So the great thing is with this document here, we can 

102
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,670
pull it in as we need it. We can modify it anytime we like.

103
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:41,720
Now, if you want access to any of the prompts or the instructions and documents that 

104
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:46,200
I'm creating, they're all available in my community, and I'm going to be making that 

105
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:51,80
link available soon on the YouTube channel. So check it out there if you want the 

106
00:07:51,80 --> 00:07:53,960
actual prompts. That said, let's keep going.

107
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:58,320
So we've got a great little document. I'm just going to kick off a new prompt. And 

108
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:03,400
what the document says is that we've got detailed descriptions for each of the styles. 

109
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:08,880
We've got why they would work for the target that we've got advertising, maybe a 

110
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:15,280
bit of artwork, we've got colour palettes. My question is what sort of technology 

111
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,320
do we want to use?

112
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:21,370
So I want to use something consistent across all five, but I am open to it. Having 

113
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:26,640
specific ideas around potential styles, it might just make sense to use a particular 

114
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,250
library.

115
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,880
I'm not sure if we want pure JavaScript, whether 

116
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,760
we want something like D3 for JavaScript, or whether 

117
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,730
we want something like tailwind for CSS, so it's just coming up with ideas at the 

118
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:39,280
moment.

119
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:44,830
Let's bring up the document as well. So we've got the tech stack analysis going on, 

120
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,570
and we'll visualize it 

121
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:52,420
in the markdown document here. But the basic things, it's said that each demo can 

122
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:59,230
be a self-contained HTML file. We'll use the HTML canvas, minimal, raw CSS and vanilla 

123
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,600
JavaScript. So this is great. We could run 

124
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,980
this in Gemini, we could run it 

125
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:07,390
in Codex, we could run it in Claude, which we're going to do today, or the Claude 

126
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:13,250
Artifact system up in the cloud. And each of these individual requirements documents 

127
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:13,960
should just 

128
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:18,160
come up with something unique. By the way, one of the reasons I like to run these 

129
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:23,140
across different environments is because you can use the same input requirements 

130
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,500
and get different styles 

131
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:26,980
based on the large language model you use. 

132
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:32,230
And I think one of the really great things about what it said is that these awesome 

133
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:36,640
libraries are overkill for what we're trying to do. And this was one of the reasons 

134
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:42,790
why I wanted the Claude MD not to describe any architectures up front. I wanted to 

135
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:47,290
see what this system would come up with. And this is part of the contest engineering 

136
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:47,980
approach.

137
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:53,50
Now with our tech stack analysis done, I want to go and figure out what the next 

138
00:09:53,50 --> 00:09:58,360
step is. Now, I'm not sure if we want to build requirements documents for the five 

139
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:03,520
different styles or whether we need an intermediate document. So I'm letting it have 

140
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,570
a think about it. 

141
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:10,240
And the main reason for this is I want to build an AI agent, I guess. So I've got 

142
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,680
this little section in here 

143
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:18,40
and giving it extra context about the fact that we need an agent that can do AB testing. 

144
00:10:18,80 --> 00:10:23,210
In other words, create more than one version of each animation style from the same 

145
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:28,490
requirements document. Now it's come up with a document strategy, so let's read that 

146
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:30,10
and see what it's thinking. 

147
00:10:30,10 --> 00:10:34,450
And this is perfect. We've got, firstly, the human sort of document. The document 

148
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:39,10
strategy is the style guide, and this is where we can consider all the different 

149
00:10:39,10 --> 00:10:44,770
aspects of each individual style and let it go a little bit deep into it. The second 

150
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:50,890
one is the requirements document. This is what the agent will use to build the website 

151
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,00
or the animation. 

152
00:10:52,00 --> 00:10:55,100
So it's given us a proposed structure, five different 

153
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:59,930
style guides. We'll have a number of requirements documents. It's given a template 

154
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:00,320
for how the 

155
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,360
style guide would work and a template for the requirements documents. But it's come 

156
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,800
up with two options. I usually go with the recommendation, but let's just have a 

157
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,400
quick read 

158
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:15,500
and I'm glad I did read it. So for this video, we will go with option A, because 

159
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:21,440
I just want to test out the ideas, but if I was doing it for an actual project, I 

160
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:27,200
would use option B. I want to go deep into anyone's style. So we can just say option 

161
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,670
A, or I'll say Go with the recommendation 

162
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:36,80
like that, and it will start building out the documents that we want. We are going 

163
00:11:36,80 --> 00:11:42,680
to see them come through on our Visual studio area, and we'll just pop up the explorer 

164
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,290
and see new concept coming in here. 

165
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:47,260
So you can see it's done a make 

166
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:52,40
dash piece. So whether it exists or doesn't exist, it'll create the Style Guides 

167
00:11:52,40 --> 00:11:58,190
folder. It's there. We've got our first file being created. It's the template, and 

168
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:03,500
what else? We can see all the different steps that it wants to do right here. One 

169
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:08,510
of the things that you can do is press Control T to hide that, but I like to see 

170
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:09,410
what's going on. 

171
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:13,910
So our first document has been created. One of the things is that it created the 

172
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:19,490
template first so that it could use that as a guideline for future documents. So 

173
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:23,390
if we click in here and go for the geometric morphing, 

174
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:28,610
we've got the visual identity of what that's all about. We've got visual characteristics, 

175
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:32,780
we've got some color palettes, and we've got some motion language. Now, 

176
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:37,910
when we get to the end of this, I'm probably going to get it to review all the documents 

177
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:43,410
to make sure that they're created in such a way that they're good for projections. 

178
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,670
Now, I'm not sure whether it needs to be done in the styling documents or whether 

179
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:51,300
we could just do it in the requirements documents, but we'll write the prompt and 

180
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,260
see what happens.

181
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:57,60
Okay. We've now got five different style guides that we can work with. What I think 

182
00:12:57,60 --> 00:13:02,860
I'll do next is create an agent, something with a role. And the role will specifically 

183
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:09,220
be around software architecture or business analyst. And what I want it to do is 

184
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,820
create the first agent

185
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,140
who understands how to work with the tech stack, 

186
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:17,810
understands how to work with any of the style guides, and can produce a requirements 

187
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:24,170
document. It's also got a little bit of a special capability, and that's at any graphics 

188
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:29,290
that we generate should be designed for projectors. So when you're projecting on 

189
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:34,570
a wall, if you have an edge to the graphic, like say, a box, it really stands out 

190
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:39,650
on the wall. Whereas if you have a black background, then it kind of blends in and 

191
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:44,570
you don't notice that it's a graphic on top of a wall, it can make it look a little 

192
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,770
bit more realistic.

193
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:52,860
So we have our first agent name is Maya, requirements Architect Agent. Let's go and 

194
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:59,780
have a look what she looks like. We'll click in here and there we have Maya. So the 

195
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:03,770
main things is understands the tech stack, the requirements, 

196
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:08,900
style guides, how to write a requirements document, and it's got this critical feature 

197
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:16,160
that it understands how to draw edge management. So make it look nice against a background 

198
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,600
like a wall or of a shop, 

199
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:22,470
and we can see what's included here. So as we scroll through, we should see the role 

200
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:25,560
definition, project design principles going on, 

201
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:32,580
knowledge about the tech stack and the agent workflow. So the input process and output 

202
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:36,960
sort of concept. Let's look at this. We've got a little bit of technical implementation 

203
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:42,600
details that it's already pre-trained with. It's not the developer agent, but it's 

204
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:48,380
got basic ideas that it can pass on to the developer agent. Looks like we've also 

205
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:51,360
got a requirements document template for us. 

206
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,790
Now, I will point out that I'm a big proponent of the bmad method. For most of my 

207
00:14:55,790 --> 00:15:00,890
coding. I use a proper context engineering framework. But as you can see, you can 

208
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:05,490
build your own frameworks pretty quickly with just some simple context engineering 

209
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:06,200
prompts.

210
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:12,20
So the next step, I wanna start building requirements documents. I also want to find 

211
00:15:12,20 --> 00:15:16,80
out exactly what structure it thinks we should come up with for the requirements 

212
00:15:16,80 --> 00:15:21,690
documents. And then at the very end, I wanted to suggest the sort of software developer 

213
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:27,650
we need to implement these requirements. And that's so I don't need to actually tell 

214
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:31,910
it what to do. It'll come up with a good idea of what the software developer should 

215
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:36,810
look like. And then after that we can simply say, create this as an agent. But let's 

216
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:37,880
see what it's come up with 

217
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:42,810
So this is a great structure. There is one problem I can see already, but we've got 

218
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:46,130
our style guides, we've got our requirements documents that we are 

219
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:52,230
going to be creating. We've got our mayor requirements agent, and our new agent is 

220
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:58,70
going to go in here. The problem I have is with the demos, this all looks good, but 

221
00:15:58,70 --> 00:16:02,900
I want to do AB testing, which means that for any one style or requirements that 

222
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:08,510
we're going to work with, let's create 3, 4, 5 different versions of it just so that 

223
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,410
we've got variety. 

224
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:14,90
So I've just confirmed most of the statements that's come up with, I've said to go 

225
00:16:14,90 --> 00:16:20,60
with Kai, let it build an agent. I've made sure that we've got this variation number, 

226
00:16:20,60 --> 00:16:26,240
basically a number of variations starting hopefully from one, I didn't specifically 

227
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:30,260
give the number, but it should be able to work that out. And then I said, go ahead 

228
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:34,340
and create all five requirements and the agent, so when we look at 

229
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:34,850
the to-dos, 

230
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,00
the control t, to see that, we can 

231
00:16:38,00 --> 00:16:41,930
see that it's going to create five different requirements and then 

232
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:44,900
it's going to create the Kai developer agent.

233
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:50,210
Now here we are with an updated project structure and we've got our new agent and 

234
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:55,160
everything's looking a lot cleaner. So we still have our style guides and requirements 

235
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:01,640
as before. The demos folder has just become a read me document with a naming convention 

236
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,90
guideline. 

237
00:17:02,90 --> 00:17:06,920
Now, when we look at the agents, we've still got our existing agent Mayor with the 

238
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:12,620
key feature being Albert to work with projection style setups for graphics generation. 

239
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:20,390
And we've got Kai, who is a developer, very specialized in what sort of work this 

240
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,150
agent does 60 frame per second, 

241
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:29,510
performance optimization, single HTML, contained pages. And we're using the Canvas, 

242
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:29,990
API 

243
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:35,540
and essentially just reading, reading and writing simple documents. So as we go through 

244
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:40,640
this, we can also see that the demo output structures have been reformatted a little 

245
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:47,390
bit, so that we have the AB testing area in here. So we might be able to do three 

246
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:52,280
different animations and we can see them all through the A, the B, and the C. 

247
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:57,50
And if we just go down to Visual Studio, we can see the new documents or the, we've 

248
00:17:57,50 --> 00:18:01,730
got the demos, we have all the instructions on how this is meant to work. It's also 

249
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:08,570
given now a couple of examples of how you could run these pages directly from JavaScript 

250
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:08,870
or 

251
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:14,390
from Python. And we've got the Kai developer going on in here. Let's visualize it 

252
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:14,840
properly. 

253
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:20,810
we've got the full role and identity core responsibilities being listed, the code, 

254
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:23,990
formats and standards that the developer works to. 

255
00:18:25,40 --> 00:18:29,540
And of course, if you need any of the prompts or the structures here, it's all available 

256
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:32,390
in my community. There's a link down in the description.

257
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:38,240
Now we're nearly at the point where we can start testing the system to see how the 

258
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:43,360
animations work. But before we do that, let's have a little bit of an audit of the 

259
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:48,520
system just to see how the prompts and the structures are holding up. So what I've 

260
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:52,240
done is just started off with a little prompt asking for 

261
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,880
a holistic review of the system. We want to look at the agents. We want to look at 

262
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,960
the style guides. We want to look at the requirements documents. And all of this 

263
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,760
is to make sure that everything is structurally sound. And then from there, hopefully 

264
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:12,160
we can move on to just generating our HTML animations or if there's any feedback, 

265
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,80
we can operate on that as well.

266
00:19:14,80 --> 00:19:18,440
Now, just as we're going. I saw this little tip here. I'd. I've been able to add 

267
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:23,360
images into Claude Code all along by referencing them by file, but I just found out 

268
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,280
that one of the things that you can do

269
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:30,560
is if you've got a picture in your clipboard, like I do right now, I can press

270
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:37,40
control V. Now I'm on a mac and the normal paste operation is command V, so this 

271
00:19:37,40 --> 00:19:40,520
has never worked before until I just saw this tip right now. 

272
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,520
Anyway this is finished the comprehensive system audit. Let's go check it out.

273
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:50,930
So the great thing about an audit is that if there's any slight discrepancies, and 

274
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:56,420
we can see one in the naming conventions here, it can be fixed pretty quickly. 

275
00:19:56,420 --> 00:20:01,70
there's going to be some questions that need to be answered. So what I'm gonna do 

276
00:20:01,70 --> 00:20:06,80
is go down to the bottom where it's got a number of questions. It's asking me, I 

277
00:20:06,80 --> 00:20:10,490
just want to apply the fixes and I want to do a little bit of a review. So let's 

278
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:15,110
just see what it comes up with. And so far, Claude is doing pretty good. I'm gonna 

279
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:18,50
press three. This is just a bit of a feedback mechanism. 

280
00:20:18,50 --> 00:20:22,190
So we've had a little bit of improvement in the naming convention. It knows about 

281
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:27,260
the AB testing here in the particular agent. It was already in the documentation, 

282
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,280
just not in the agent. 

283
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:34,700
So we've got misunderstanding and confusion resolved in both of our agents. And we've 

284
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:39,740
got a little bit of a automatic automated decision making framework going on here. 

285
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:44,990
So when open questions come up, it can autonomously deal with it using documented 

286
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:50,720
decisions. So what that means for me is that as I have different ideas that I want 

287
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,400
to become solid and true, I can document them and they can be used automatically 

288
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:01,280
by the agent. So with that said, let's move on and create our first animation.

289
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:07,280
So we have our first generation complete, it's called a geometric morphine. We can 

290
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,840
see one of the things it can work with is a bunch of parameters if you want to change 

291
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,880
the way the morphine happens, 

292
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,350
and it gives various, 

293
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:19,760
versions with different parameters that we can play with right here. Let's go have 

294
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,500
a look at what it could look like. So this is the default version, and I'll just 

295
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:29,60
show one of the others that are available. It's just going a little bit slower at 

296
00:21:29,60 --> 00:21:29,540
the moment. 

297
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:34,940
And so with our first animation created, let's just go over and see if it can do 

298
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:39,920
two other variations. And this is a great thing about working with either Codex, 

299
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:45,530
Claude Code, or Gemini. In the CLI like we're doing, this is all Claude code, which 

300
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:49,310
is my favorite. We can just start running a new agent, 

301
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:54,260
And this time we're going to generate two different animations in two separate files.

302
00:21:54,260 --> 00:22:00,580
So variation B and C are being created. It gives us a bit of information about how 

303
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:05,700
it works. And then if we move down the bottom, we can see how to open each of these 

304
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:11,900
demonstrations and also potential parameters. If we just head over to the web view, 

305
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:18,420
this is variation B going on at the moment. And if we move on to the next one we've 

306
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,380
got variation C here.

307
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:24,20
Now the one of the things that we can notice about everything that we're doing is 

308
00:22:24,20 --> 00:22:28,980
that there is no edge at the side of the screen. And this was one of the important 

309
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:34,60
rules of this particular developer. And of the styles that we were producing, is 

310
00:22:34,60 --> 00:22:39,580
that it should look good on a projector, on a wall without having any images to the 

311
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:44,740
edge. And this is something I've just noticed using projectors on walls is that if 

312
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:49,180
you've got this edge, it just looks a little bit odd in the animations.

313
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:53,940
So now we can just finish off with a bulk running of the system. So I'm just going 

314
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:58,340
to kick off the prompt and talk a little bit about what's going to happen next. So 

315
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:03,300
we have four other styles that we haven't looked at at the moment. And we can see 

316
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:09,860
them coming up here. We've got kinetic type fluid gradients particle system and anamorphic 

317
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:16,420
3D. And what I've also asked for it to do is generate the three variations per type. 

318
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:21,420
Now we could add other custom instructions. We could make statements like we want 

319
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:25,900
it to have a Christmas or a Halloween theme or whatever we want, but for now, we're 

320
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:30,220
just keeping it simple. This will take a little bit of time to run, but at the end 

321
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:36,300
of it we should have 12 new HTML animations that we can test. Hopefully we've got 

322
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:36,980
reports. 

323
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:39,940
and we'll have a look at everything once this is complete.

324
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:44,740
Now here we are at the end of the generation. I dunno how long it took. It was going 

325
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:48,250
for about five minutes. I went out for a coffee. And that's the good thing about 

326
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:53,470
using Claude Code. You can pretty reliably believe that it'll end up with a good 

327
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:58,870
solution. So long as your requirements documents, you processes are well written. 

328
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:04,840
So what I did was I let it run through and I also kicked off a prompt before I left 

329
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:10,720
for the coffee and I just asked it to create a little bit of an index HTML file, 

330
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:13,990
because I wanted to be able to see all the different, 

331
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:19,870
types of generations, but also the variations. So as it went through, it started 

332
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:24,280
building out documentation. We've got a demo's reference, we've got a quick reference 

333
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:30,10
and we've got the primary file that I'd like to open. So what we'll do is we will 

334
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:36,730
open that file right now, and here we have it. It's got the AI, programmatic art 

335
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:40,30
gallery. We've got 15 projection ready demonstrations. 

336
00:24:40,30 --> 00:24:42,640
let's see what this text along the top does. 

337
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,920
it's just taking us down to the different areas. Okay, that's interesting. So 

338
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:53,290
What I'll do is option, click on each of these and just make sure that I'm opening 

339
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:58,690
up variations just to see how they all work and let's go check it out.

340
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:03,730
Okay, and here we go. We've got our first one that we were working with earlier and 

341
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:09,790
a variation from it. As I was going through and just checking these out, I noticed 

342
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:13,810
that not all of them worked nicely and this is the reason why it's really good to 

343
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:19,390
have variations. The variations are the same requirements document, but it's a different 

344
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:25,660
interpretation each time. So let's keep going. This is where the kinetic text kick 

345
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:28,510
in and this just looks wonderful. This sort of, 

346
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:32,800
text. You could use it on your YouTube channel. I would use it on my YouTube channel, 

347
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:38,350
to change different concepts. So here we've got kinetic topography. I wonder if we 

348
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:41,170
can change any of the words. 

349
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:47,740
And I was able to change the words programmatically. There's a actual variables up 

350
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:52,630
the top of this URL, but they're not working. But I've got AppyDave, I've got AR 

351
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:57,970
A-I-T-L-D-R, which are two of the channels that I have. And if you're after any of 

352
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:01,570
the prompts that we're using here, you can join the community. There's a link in 

353
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:06,760
the description, but let's move through. We've got these gradient fluid effects coming 

354
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:11,530
through a few different types. I noticed that a lot of them were quite similar here. 

355
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:18,430
And then we move into the particle effects, which are pretty cool actually. So 

356
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:26,170
other particle systems going on, just variations here. And then we've got these anamorphic 

357
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:28,420
3D objects coming through. 

358
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:34,00
So the same thing done with text. So this is excellent. This is sort of stuff that 

359
00:26:34,00 --> 00:26:39,820
we can now go out and put on the walls of buildings using the projector. Let's try 

360
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:40,510
that next.

361
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:46,360
Before we finish up, I decided to create some documentation and a new agent. So the 

362
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:52,750
new agent that we've created is Iris. And Iris will be able to create new design 

363
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:58,120
documents for us. We've got Maya, who will turn it into the technical architecture 

364
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:04,180
guidelines or the requirements documents. And then we've also got Kai. And Kai is 

365
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:08,800
the one that will do all the development. Now what this means is that if you wanted 

366
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:15,40
to create dozens of different styles, you can use Iris to do that, and then Maya 

367
00:27:15,40 --> 00:27:21,370
and Kai will turn it into the HTML version, the canvas, the animations, this sort 

368
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:21,880
of stuff. 

369
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:27,520
Now as you're watching this, you might also start seeing the projector versions of 

370
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:32,710
these animations. So this is something I'm doing later tonight. I don't know how 

371
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:34,120
they're going to look, but you are seeing, 

372
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,770
for the first time right here. 

373
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:39,550
and consider this a simple and easy way to create 

374
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:45,490
animations that you could put onto a shop front. You could do it for an arts installation, 

375
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:50,320
anything like that. Now, I've also updated the documentation. It's in the middle 

376
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:55,660
of doing that right now, so that it has a startup guide, and this is available to 

377
00:27:55,660 --> 00:28:01,30
anyone who's a member of the community. So please click the link in the description. 

378
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:03,370
I'm AppyDave. I'll see you in the next video.
