and this philosophy that I'm following I embedded into my YouTube work I do it
into the movie work and we do it in our other YouTube channel and what that

channels in the last three years have produced more than 400 videos and the
team with AITLDR are working on 250 uploads recently and all of that was an
incredibly hard slog and so now we're getting all the automations in place so
that we can ramp up and test different ideas in education and storytelling
