So everything's been uploaded I did notice there were a couple of files that
need to be downloaded so we're running 64 at the moment and what it'll do is
only do the files in the folder it needs to so in this particular case there were
a bunch of version edits going on so many of the files I already have. So it's
finished checking the 16 files there was only one file that I still had to have
downloaded and there's a second one now it would be nicer if I had tools that
did multiple projects it now would be nicer if I had multiple projects at once
but this is just something I'll vibe code into the tool a bit later on anyway
so let's run a new damn list it's still on AD and we are using the S3 flag and
now all that's left is that everything is synced or I haven't yet created a
video ready to upload or there's one file that I forgot to do
