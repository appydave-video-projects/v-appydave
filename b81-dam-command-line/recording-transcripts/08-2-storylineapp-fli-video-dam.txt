So I'll quickly go through this and state that Storyline is about generating movies.
It's about taking a transcript, extracting the beats, turning it into image prompts and animation prompts,
and also extracting the sound profiles for emotion and that sort of areas.
Then we move on to Flyhub, which is where I do all my recording from,
and this is the stuff doing transcripts, generating images directly from transcripts.
