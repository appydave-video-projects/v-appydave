Now, while I'm primarily a YouTuber, I do manage other brands.
So the two YouTube channels I run is Abby Dave and AITLDR, which is a faceless YouTube
channel on movie making and video creation using AI.
But there are three, but there are three, but there are also two brick and mortar businesses,
Beauty and Joy, which is a nail salon, Kiros, which is early education.
And then you've got Support Signal, which is an AI-based SaaS application for disability
services in Australia.
And then lastly, the movie studio, which is Voz Creative.
