Number one is story creation. So the storyline application is about turning
transcripts into images, videos and audio files. Then there's Flyhub which I've
paired with Ecamm Live and this is allowing me to do the recordings and
make sure I'm generating transcripts and turning them into images along the way.
And once I've done my own video editing I will then start managing the lifestyle
and then once I've done my own video editing it will then go through a
life cycle of going to further. And once I've done a basic edit on this video it
will head over to someone on the team to do further editing enhancement and be
returned so that it can go through a YouTube launch optimization.
