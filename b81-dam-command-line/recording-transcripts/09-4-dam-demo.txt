So what that's doing is showing us a combination of files that are locally on
the computer, local storage and the ones that are Git tracked and the reason this
is important to understand is that I've got all my images and text files in Git
repos. It keeps it free to use and I can also process them in the cloud using AI
and so I have DAM files designed to deal with the Git repos. This one's doing a
check on all the different brands to see if there are any files that I need to
push up on my brand or the other brands that I'm managing and as you can see it's
just standard Git repos so you can use ordinary Git commands so if we run the
Git repo status all again we should get better information because I've gone and
done a push on all the changes and while that's a gap in the tool today what will
happen is later in the week I will look at that problem and just use some vibe
coding and make it a first-class citizen of the command structure within digital
asset management.
