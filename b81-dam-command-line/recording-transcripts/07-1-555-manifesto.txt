Now, I have been talking about a few different tools, but it might be wise to look at the
philosophy behind why I got to where I am with the tools I have.
And that's because a few years ago when I was playing around with ChatGPT, I started
having conversations with it around my video journey, and I'd come up with this idea called
the 555 Manifesto.
And that Hollywood trailer video that you saw earlier was very much about that.
It was Appydave and the Mountain of Mastery.
And this is that circle as you go around the mountain and you see different views of the
world and you're looking at it from the video content creator's point of view.
And what I wanted to do was test the idea of could I run five different channels and
produce 555 videos in 55 weeks.
Now, it's not a goal, it's more an aspiration, it's something I'm trying to do.
And the only way you can do that is by automating your systems.
