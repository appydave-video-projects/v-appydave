So to understand a stack that can keep your seats and your storage costs down, we've got
to come back and look at how I'm putting together my digital asset management.
So the first one is when I'm recording a video, there's local storage.
So I've already paid for the hard drive.
When I'm dealing with anything that's lightweight and that's anything that's an image or a text
file or a bit of audio, I'm using GitHub repos and they're free.
So they're all being stored up in GitHub repos and synchronized with the team using special
tooling.
As soon as we've got anything that's heavy, and that's for me is a video, we're using
S3 staging, we're using Amazon S3 buckets to store the information, but we're only doing
it for anywhere up to 90 days because it's only on the currently produced content.
After that, we're storing everything offline in a big NAS, and after that, we're storing
everything offline in a network addressable storage.
And this gives us medium term but quick access to anything we want.
Then the longer term storage solution is to look at Amazon Glacier.
And this is incredibly cheap on a per terabyte basis per month that it really doesn't affect
the cost over time.
