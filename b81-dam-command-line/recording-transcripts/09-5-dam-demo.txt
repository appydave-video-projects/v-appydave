So if we come and look at the lifecycle management for DAM, we've done the local storage and
the git trapped, what we're going to do now is deal with the files that need to be edited.
So we come back to our terminal and before we used the DAM list AD for AppyDave, we'll
just use a little flag in this case and it's the S3, it's going to get all the local files
but it's also going to have a look at what the state of them are, do they need to be
uploaded, downloaded or are they in sync with everything on your computer. So from this
we can see files that have been edited and I need to get the latest copy of them. We
can see files in which I've got the same version as the S3 version and we can see a bunch of
projects that I've done editing on locally but they've not yet been committed, but they're
not yet been uploaded to S3 so they're still to be edited.
