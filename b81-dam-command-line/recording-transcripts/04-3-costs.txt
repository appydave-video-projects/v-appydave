So one of the problems then that you've got to deal with if you grow is that as storage
increases the cost goes up, as seats increase the cost goes up.
And so you start seeing some sort of structure like this where your prices start to snowball.
And what I wanted was more of a flat cost structure where once I've paid a little bit
of money for the storage I've got and I'm going for the right storage for the right
solution my prices really change even if I add more people or a lot more storage.
