Now, the prices I'm showing here are samples, they're only for demonstration.
They're close, but I haven't fully researched them.
But the thing to be aware of is that when you're dealing with the cost of storage with
these tools, you're paying for about three things.
One would be the cost of the storage itself.
One would be the seats, the number of people that can access it.
Sometimes it's for editing reasons, sometimes it's just for read only, especially with clients.
And the other area that you've got to deal with is do they have any automations built
in that automate the workflows you're using?
