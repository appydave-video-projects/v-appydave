On any day of the week, I could be working as a YouTuber,
I could be doing movies and creative sort of work,
or I could be doing a set of social media assets and videos,
and I'm working with multiple people.
So what ends up happening is I have these collaboration flows that I have to work through.
I might record a video, upload it to Amazon S3,
then one of my editors, Jan, would take it and see what he can do to improve it.
Then I want to have it downloaded back onto my computer,
ultimately I want to publish it.
Now the other thing that's often going on with me is that,
and the other thing that I'm often trying to manage,
is how do I keep my costs down from using tools like Dropbox or Google Drive,
and I do that using a multi-tiered storage system.
So some of my files are on S3, some of them are on a network addressable storage,
and others are on, and others, and others are,
and longer term storage is with Amazon Glacier.
