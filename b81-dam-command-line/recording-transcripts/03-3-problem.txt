The other big issue is dealing with multi-tenants and how do we manage costs at different life
cycles of the videos.
So are we using free storage using GitHub repos, are we using quick synchronizations
for the videos that are currently in edit using your Amazon S3, are we using medium
term storage where anyone can access anything through the network addressable storage, or
have we got really long term archival, or have we got affordable and long term archival
using Amazon Glacier.
