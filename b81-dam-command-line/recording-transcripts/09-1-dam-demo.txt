Now finally after a few rabbit holes we're at the demonstration of DAM so
we'll head down to our terminal and the way we use this tool is by typing in
DAM and we can put in help and this will give us a list of capabilities within
the tool. So we've got tools for dealing with both brand and project level assets
within the repositories. Then we've got the tools that are designed for editing
the videos, sending them up to S3, bringing them down to S3. We can also
discover what's already on S3 or share it as a shareable link. Got access to the
commands that allow us to backup information either to local SSD drives
or to the NAS and in the future the Glacier system. And lastly we've got the
basic listing and query sort of tools.
