So that segment I just recorded right then has just appeared on my computer, it's gone
into an Ecamm live directory at the moment and it's actually ready to be moved into a
new location.
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to press rename and this is currently chapter
six in this video, segment one, I'm talking about the Flyhub and so when I do a rename
what's going to happen is it's going to go over to my recordings folder and the recordings
folder is everything I've been recording, it's all sitting here and at the moment it
should be in the middle of transcribing so it is transcribing at the moment and what
that means is that once that's finished we can come back to the recordings we've got
and we can go and have a look at any of the transcripts during the time of the video
and all this information can be dealt with with large language models and that could
be and there's any number of things I can do with that, I could have it improve the
way I'm doing my recordings by analysing everything I say, I can put it through my storyline application
which is about taking any of the transcripts and turning them into images and from there
turning them into animations so that we can turn them into movies.
