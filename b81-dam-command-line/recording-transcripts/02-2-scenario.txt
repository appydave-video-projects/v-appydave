Now, I'm primarily a YouTuber working on the AppyDave channel, and I also have the
AITLDR channel, which is a faceless AI YouTube channel, and on that channel we're actually
talking about how to create movies, doing image editing, videos, sound files, all that
sort of stuff.
But apart from that, we're also working with movie creation, we've got SaaS applications,
and a couple of standard brick and mortar businesses that just need some social media
content.
