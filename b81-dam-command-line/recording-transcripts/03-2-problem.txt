So one of the big problems I'm dealing with is digital asset management or really it's
distributed digital asset management because there's multiple people in multiple regions
because what happens on a daily basis is I might be recording a video that's going to
have different segments and chapters, it's going to be combined together, then it's going
to be uploaded so that a video editor can download it, work on it, make the changes,
and then lastly I download it so then it can be published to YouTube.
