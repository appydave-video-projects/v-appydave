Now, I do have videos in the pipeline on talking about DAM in relation to the Flyhub video
and also in relation to ClaudeSkills, but when we look at Fly Video, we've briefly
looked at that tonight as well, we've briefly looked at Fly Video today and we can see that
I'm in the middle of finishing off the recording, so I've just done a recap, I'm in the middle
of a second recap right now, and we can see all the videos that have been recorded during
this session with the second recap about to come through, and I have about five videos
on this tool that I've been building looking at the way I'm dealing with assets and thumbnails
and various projects that I'm building from almost every day at the moment, and in the
next couple of weeks, I plan to produce a bunch of new videos on a new version of the
Storyline app.
