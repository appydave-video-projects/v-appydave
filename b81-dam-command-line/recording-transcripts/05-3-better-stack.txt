So my approach has been to come up with my own ways of doing this and automating it and
picking the right technology along the way.
So I'm using a lot of Amazon S3 for videos that might be one, two or three months old.
I've got NAS Archives going on which is giving us our 6 to 12 month timeline on modelable
brands.
Then we're looking into Amazon Glacier as our long term keep everything for a couple
of years sort of point of view.
The other thing that we're looking to do is deal with the costs involved with AI.
So rather than using any of the Zapier or NA10, most of what I'm doing, I'm doing locally
in automations from my own tooling.
So not only am I getting cost reductions through the different techniques that I'm using here,
I'm also getting instantaneous results which really improves.
