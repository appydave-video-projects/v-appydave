Now, a quick recap, we've got the multi-brand DAM, so we've been looking at it mostly from
EpiDave, but it is designed to work around various brands.
It's got the collaboration workflow of how I work with the team, also with clients, there's
other workflows for that as well.
It's the idea that it has multiple layers of storage, so we can see those layers from
the local through to the Git repos, onto the Amazon S3.
After that, we've got the network.
After that, we've got the network addressable storage, which is about to be implemented.
We've also got the Amazon Glacier for the future.
