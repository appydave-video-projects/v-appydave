So the behind the scenes of what I've been doing has been solving different
problems. The 555 Manifesto helped me understand the video journey. Then I
needed to deal with all the cost infrastructure issues, dealing with
multiple brands, dealing with multiple YouTube channels, automation, that sort
of stuff. And so I developed a bunch of tools and these are all generally free.
They're either open source or they're without warranty. They're just tools I
use internally and if you want access to the code for some of them they're either
available through repos or over time they'll be available through my
community. But they basically boil down to three areas of the video generation
process.
