So, I've put that information in down here and then what we'll just do is create a script
and use 11labs and other sort of video animation techniques to build the 30 second video.
And we'll just use 11labs Higgs field and other animation tools to create this 30 second
video.
So, we'll just use 11labs Higgs field and we'll just use 11labs Higgs field and we'll
just use 11labs Higgs field and we'll just use 11labs Higgs field and we'll just use 11labs
Higgs field and we'll just use 11labs Higgs field and we'll just use 11labs Higgs field
and we'll just use 11labs Higgs field and we'll just use 11labs Higgs field and we'll just
use 11labs Higgs field and we'll just use 11labs Higgs field and we'll just use 11labs Higgs
field and we'll just use 11labs Higgs field and we'll just use 11labs Higgs field and we'll
just use 11labs Higgs field and we'll just use 11labs Higgs field and we'll just use 11labs Higgs
