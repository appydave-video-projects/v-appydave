So the interesting thing is, I'm right at the end of recording this session.
I started at 7.30 this morning, it's now 8.37, so about an hour.
And what I think might be useful is, I'm just going to go and grab all the transcripts,
we'll put that together, this is now one document, I should be able to copy this button, it's
in the clipboard right now.
We might head over to our context engineering window again and put in a little prompt that

So I thought I'd just do a couple more videos so what we'll do is we'll do a
10 to 15 deck slide deck and we'll just base it off the video transcript that
I'm doing right now.
