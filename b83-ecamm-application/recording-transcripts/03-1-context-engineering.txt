Now what I actually do is teach context engineering so I'm just taking the
information there and I'm just going to ask what is that and that's everything
that was on this particular page and we just try to learn some context. Now
because it's raw data all we're going to do is ask it to be turned into a machine
readable format that's JSON. So there's our machine readable format and so now
we have machine readable data what we'll do is we'll come over and pick a bunch
of images I've already grabbed four of them we've got two avatars a beautiful
slide deck and this map and I'm just letting the AI describe the images right
now so that's coming through at the moment.
