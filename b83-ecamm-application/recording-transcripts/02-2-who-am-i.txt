So we just recorded part of the who am I section but let's get into who am I so
two years ago I created the 555 manifesto this was the idea of could I
create five channels and over 55 weeks create 555 videos and that ended up
becoming a Hollywood trailer are forged in the fires of the YouTube
battlefield only the strongest the most persistent the most clickbait driven
warriors will survive. Now coming back to what we're talking about did
I get there no I didn't but what I have done over the last few years is played
around with about seven or eight channels two of them have got two and a
half thousand subs one to 1,500 subs and that's two of them are here it's the
Appy Dave and the AIT LDR but what I also do is apply all my YouTube systems
and tools to my girlfriend couple of my friends and Vos and we're here we're
doing a movie creation studio
