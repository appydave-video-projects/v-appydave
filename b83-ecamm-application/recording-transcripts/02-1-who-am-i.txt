So a little bit about me I am Appy Dave and for the last four months I have not
done much work because I've lived in Philippines, Australia, traveled to
America and come back to where I currently live which is Thailand and
I've not been able to get any videos out until last week when I got a two hour
80 hours to record video monstrosity out. Now on the side I'm also running a
faceless YouTube channel which someone else is managing for me using prompt
engineering, context engineering and various graphic and audio generation
tools and I do get to make the odd AI appearance.
