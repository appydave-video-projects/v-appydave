the final unlisted video that I do for the application will be basically made
up of six different individual pages plus a 14 slide deck so we can see the

Curding with this was ensure that it looked like the same style that they had

graphics and I've also used it for the image generation and I've got more than
enough talking points to do in a slideshow but I've also got the actual
but I've also got the actual slide deck which I can go through and I'll
definitely add a bit of video elements to this before I publish it. So now we
can truly say I'm happy Dave please like and subscribe I'll see you in the next
video
