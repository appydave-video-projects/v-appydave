So the video editing with Gling is finished.
This is how you cut different information out
and then I've got the video sitting right here
at six minutes and 18 seconds long.
And one of the things I realized from that
is that it's actually too long for the application.
So this has really now become the behind the scenes
of doing the application.
And what I will have is just a slide date
that I've put together.
But essentially what I've done here
is I've vibe coded this whole slide date.
You can see that it's 13 different scenes going on here.
All done in one prompt.
And then I had one secondary prompt
just to say that I needed a little bit of data change.
