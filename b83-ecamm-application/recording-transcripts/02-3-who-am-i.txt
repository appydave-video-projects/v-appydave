Let's save that and keep going.
So the 555 manifesto is basically a bunch of principles
that I'm working to.
But the only way for me to make it happen
is to build a bunch of tools.
So I have this application called
the Storyline Application.
And let's just see if this video pops into place.
So I use the Storyline Application
to create a five minute video.
And in this video, we're seeing character consistency,
scene consistency, and, well, a whole lot of AI
and hard work going into the process.
But the other tool that you've been watching me use
is FlyVideo.
And FlyVideo is where I'm automatically routing
eCAM live videos onto my computer,
transcribing them, using large language models
to generate B-roll images.
We'll probably see B-roll images in this video in a moment.
But then the next step I need to go
is go into digital asset management.
And the digital asset management is more software
that I've created that runs from the command line
that allows me to package this up
and automatically transfer it to my video editor.
He just puts on a little bit of information on top of it
because I've done part of the editing in Gling.
Bring it back, and then we take it through
the Agent Workflow Builder,
which I personally taught about at the beginning of 2024.
