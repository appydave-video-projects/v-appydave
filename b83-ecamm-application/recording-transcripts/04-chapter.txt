Now we're getting into the asset generation and since we've met Jill and
Caleb we might as well start coming up with some images that are going to suit
and we'll head over to the asset management system where we've got a
bunch of images and for now we're just going to assign them all to the intro so
we're just assigning the map and we've got named files for Jill Caleb and a
bunch of Davids

Now, I've just coded up a bit of information about the Content Compass system.
This is all based off the transcripts from the YouTube video, as well as anything that
we can see on the home page, including Jill and Caleb.
We'll throw in some animated avatars over the top of that.
I think it'd be great if we had some animated avatars over the top of that, and let's go
and edit this as well.
So I'm just kicking off a prompt that's going to bring me into the group of two people.
We've got two leaders and one content creator.

So that information has just come through let's refresh the page and there
we have it we have Abby Dave in the mix now.
