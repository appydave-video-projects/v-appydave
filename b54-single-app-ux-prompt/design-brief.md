📍 Design Brief: Desktop Single-App Framework Shell

🎯 Purpose

To design a desktop-first UX shell tailored for a single application, housed in a cohesive, intuitive interface. The system emphasizes flexibility, persistent state, and clear navigation patterns. It draws inspiration from desktop tools like VS Code and Slack, and borrows selective mobile patterns (e.g. Command-K), while prioritizing spacious, responsive desktop layout.

This system is built using **native HTML and JavaScript**, styled with **Tailwind CSS**.

🛡️ Core Layout Structure

1. **Sidebar Menu (Far Left)**

* Fixed in place on the left side of the screen.

Flat structure with four menu items:

* **Dashboard** – Loads a simple placeholder dashboard view.
* **Wizard** – Loads a one-step wizard-style interface.
* **Form** – Loads a structured data input form.
* **Analytics** – Placeholder panel for simple visual or summary output.

Each item updates the central content panel accordingly.

At the bottom, a **Settings icon** opens a pop-up for system-wide appearance preferences (light/dark mode, etc.).

2. **Main Display Panel (Center)**

* Primary canvas for the application.
* Reacts to the selected menu item from the sidebar.

Interaction styles supported:

* Simple dashboards
* Wizard-like interfaces (single step for now)
* Structured forms
* Analytics or visualization panels

The layout is flexible — no fixed tab or scroll behaviors assumed. Common layout behaviors can be implemented using registered components.

---

3. **Command-K Interface**

* Accessible via Cmd/Ctrl + K.
* Supports searching within the current app:

  * App sections (e.g., menu items)
  * Internal data (e.g., form labels, field names, dashboard items)

Visual search preview interaction TBD. Initial launch can use mock data and placeholder interface.

---

🛡️ Shell Components

* **Top Bar (Optional)**

  * May show current section title
  * Optional global actions (e.g., theme switcher, user info)

---

⚙️ Shared Component System

* The shell provides a central registry of shared UI components:

  * Form inputs
  * Wizard progress
  * Toasts and errors
  * Navigation aids (breadcrumbs optional)

This ensures visual consistency and speeds development. Custom components should only be added if functionally distinct.

---

🗃️ App State & Data Context

* State is preserved when navigating between views (e.g., sidebar sections).
* Each browser tab maintains isolated visual context.

---

🎨 Theming & Appearance

* Light and dark mode supported
* Configurable in the system-level Settings pop-up
* Applied consistently across the app

---

This specification describes the base UX shell for an application, allowing modular content and clear internal navigation within a consistent interface.
