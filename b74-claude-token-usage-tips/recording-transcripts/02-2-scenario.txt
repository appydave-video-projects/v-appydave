Now two weeks ago I was hitting my limits pretty consistently and the reason for that
was that when you look at my development setup I've got all these terminals that I open and
they're all different projects that I'm working on.
So it does make sense that I can hit the limits of the Max 100 account pretty easily on that
alone.
