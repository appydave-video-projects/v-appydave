Now let's pick out another optimization and this time we're going to go with the
be more directive and we'll do that through example as well I think so we'll
head over to a terminal it's a new Claude window and what I'm doing is just
saying can it list and gather up some HTML files and the files that we're
looking at are the ones that generated these little presentations that you're
seeing so everything that you're seeing here is all generated in a particular
folder so if we so everything you see here is generated in a particular folder
so if we go back to this location we can see the files now we also are aware that
we have a PO and we have a dev agent so what we might say is so I've just
started a prompt that says can we read from the HTML files what we're looking
to do is gather the style and then what I wanted to do is read from a couple of
our agents so I'll put in the at symbol and I'll put in PO and we should find it
in our list of commands and we'll also do the dev agent so if we do dev should
pop up and he happens to be the second one and what's going to happen is it's
going to read whatever's going on in these two agents and turn it hopefully
into some sort of beautiful flip card system
