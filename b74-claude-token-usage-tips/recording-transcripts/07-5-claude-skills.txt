And so this is now opening up a world of opportunity, like if we look at the application I've been
building this week, which is the Recording Namer, it's taking these recordings and putting
them into different projects, we can see a bunch of projects that I've got going at the
moment.
Now, if we just go back to the terminal here and we'll put in, and we'll just use a voice
agent this time and we'll say, can you tell me what projects are going on at the moment
for Appy Dave?
And we'll let that come through and we'll just press enter.
And hopefully what it's going to do is use the skill again and it's essentially probably
going to use something like that command.
And we can see that it is and look at that, it's just returned some information.
So it's got a bunch of projects come through and we know it's live data because the project
we're working on right now is actually listed there.
And because behind the scenes it is a command line tool, we can do much more interesting
stuff.
So this is project code B74.
So we'll ask a question, what can you tell me about project B74?
We'll let that go through.
We'll just press enter on this and hopefully it's going to use maybe the discover command.
There's a couple of commands it could use.
Looks like it's going to use the status command for Appy Dave project B74.
