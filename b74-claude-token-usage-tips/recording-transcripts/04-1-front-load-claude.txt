So, let's pick another idea from the optimizations.
This time we're going to go with front loading Claude.
Now what does that mean and where would you use it quite commonly?
For me, it happens to be when I'm doing research.
So if we go down to any sort of second brain that you might have on your computer.
Now if this was BMAD, this could be the internal documentation is in BMAD or the code base
or what I'm going to show you now is when I'm using a second brain
or what I'm going to show you now is when I use a second brain
or what you might have is external data that you've grouped together in what you would call
