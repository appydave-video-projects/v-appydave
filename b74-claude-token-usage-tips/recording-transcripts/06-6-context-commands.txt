So that conversation just finished let's see what we've got we've got this new
context command it's called progress and we can see here quick orientation check
if we hover over it we've got some instructions so it'll read the backlog
change log and the brainstorming notes and then it and then it has this
formatted output that it does and then at the end it just tells you when you
can use it which is essentially any time but usually at the beginning of a
conversation and the good thing about this was when we included it in the HTML
it just put it naturally into the right place so we've still got our agents in
place and we've got this little commands here
