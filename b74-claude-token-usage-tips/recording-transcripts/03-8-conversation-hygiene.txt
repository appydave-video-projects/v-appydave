And so you'll see from time to time that different numbers were changing and that's because I'm doing different
Recordings and then I might pause for two or three minutes before the recording starts again
But what did happen is that this code finally finished so we have code and I've been checking it
I know it works
So what I now need to do is tell the product owner who's over here that the code has been updated
Can you change the backlog? Can you?
Can you change the backlog the changelog maybe update a story if you need to
So I go over to the developer and I say can you create a handoff for the product owner?
And that'll write a little document now at the moment. It's been really nice to have those two conversational windows
They only have context about what they're interested in. This one's interested in requirements
this one's interested in writing software and
Since that finished we'll just take that over and give it some more context the context being a handoff from the developer
So that it can update the documentation it needs but after a while we're going to start seeing a little simple down here
So 10% until auto compact and it's that particular
Capability that we want to stop and we do that by pressing the slash compact command on a regular basis
So if I go and copy that and we'll head over to our
Conversation streams again what I can do since the developer has finished the work they're working on
I can just say compact and kick it off now at the same time the product owner is still
Updating any documentation it needs to and so that's complete. So we'll just run a compact on this window as well
