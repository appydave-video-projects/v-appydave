So let's try this one more time we've got the same question but we're just
going to put a little bit extra on the end we're just going to say using DAM and
we'll let that kick off and see what it does and you can see based on the
context that it's got some brand structure but it's also started to kick
in something called a skill and skill involved here is DAM which is for digital
asset management system and what it's doing is running a tool that's written
in the Ruby programming language in this case and returning actual data from the
hard drive in a formatted fashion along with information from S3 drives.
