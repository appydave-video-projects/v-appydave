Now I had a basic idea of why it was happening and it's because I've moved
the way I do the terminal communication to a multi-agent workflow. So over here
I've got a product owner and this is just dealing with requirements and
communication handoff to the developer. I've then got a main development window
that I would be working on for a bigger feature but while that's happening I'll
come down and kick off another developer here, more to work on little bug fixes that I notice and while the main developer is doing a big feature I'll be going backwards and forwards between these two windows or I might even pop down to this bottom window where I might have a little bit of an information or brainstorming session.
