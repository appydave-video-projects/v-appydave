And what's happened in this particular conversation is we've got this area called developer handoff.
I've already taken a copy of it and I've come over to the developer and I can just press
enter and the developer will now start implementing whatever was suggested in the document, whatever
was suggested in the requirements handoff.
And so at the moment we can see it's starting to do five different tasks, it's writing some
code in that content.
Now as it's doing that let's see what code this is going to do.
So we've got this little design here and the idea of it is that when I stop the recording
we're going to see a value come here and then we're going to see this transcription happen.
So I'll stop the recording right now.
