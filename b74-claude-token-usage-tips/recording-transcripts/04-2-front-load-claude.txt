To explore documentation libraries what we could do is head over to a terminal
session and I've put us into one of the second brain areas I have on my computer
and we'll type in tree and we can see some of the information coming through
here. So we've got Anthropic and Claude, we've got stuff related to the SDK,
Claude code and skills, we've got a whole lot of information related to BMAD
method version 4 and version 6.
