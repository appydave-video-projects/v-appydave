So let's move on to a new optimization out there and that's using Claude skills
and this is not only good for context but this is an incredibly powerful tool
as well.

So what we'll do is we'll head over to a clean Claude code and we'll just ask a simple question
can you tell me anything about the brands that I've got.
Now what I'd probably do is go off to my file systems because of various Claude MD files,
look through our ontologies and come up with some sort of answer.

So it's come up with six brands that's actually correct and if we were to run
it the same command again in another Claude code window what we should get is
similar information it might not be formatted the same way and as you can see
it's actually a little bit slow because it's got to go and read files all over
the system and figure things out and that's actually costing a lot of context
and so the second question exactly the same in a different window does return
the correct information but as you can see it's totally different formats

So let's try this one more time we've got the same question but we're just
going to put a little bit extra on the end we're just going to say using DAM and
we'll let that kick off and see what it does and you can see based on the
context that it's got some brand structure but it's also started to kick
in something called a skill and skill involved here is DAM which is for digital
asset management system and what it's doing is running a tool that's written
in the Ruby programming language in this case and returning actual data from the
hard drive in a formatted fashion along with information from S3 drives.

And so this is now opening up a world of opportunity, like if we look at the application I've been
building this week, which is the Recording Namer, it's taking these recordings and putting
them into different projects, we can see a bunch of projects that I've got going at the
moment.
Now, if we just go back to the terminal here and we'll put in, and we'll just use a voice
agent this time and we'll say, can you tell me what projects are going on at the moment
for Appy Dave?
And we'll let that come through and we'll just press enter.
And hopefully what it's going to do is use the skill again and it's essentially probably
going to use something like that command.
And we can see that it is and look at that, it's just returned some information.
So it's got a bunch of projects come through and we know it's live data because the project
we're working on right now is actually listed there.
And because behind the scenes it is a command line tool, we can do much more interesting
stuff.
So this is project code B74.
So we'll ask a question, what can you tell me about project B74?
We'll let that go through.
We'll just press enter on this and hopefully it's going to use maybe the discover command.
There's a couple of commands it could use.
Looks like it's going to use the status command for Appy Dave project B74.
