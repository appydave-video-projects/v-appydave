So, that's some of the context-saving tips that I like to use within Cloud Code and other
large language models for that matter.
If you're interested in joining my community and having access to context engineering,
vibe coding, prompts, internal tutorials, then check out the link down below.
I also have a skill community for AIT LDR, which is more about YouTube automation.
Anyway, I'm Appy Dave, please like and subscribe, I'll see you in the next video.
