So it's come up with six brands that's actually correct and if we were to run
it the same command again in another Claude code window what we should get is
similar information it might not be formatted the same way and as you can see
it's actually a little bit slow because it's got to go and read files all over
the system and figure things out and that's actually costing a lot of context
and so the second question exactly the same in a different window does return
the correct information but as you can see it's totally different formats
