So, we've come over to the ClaudeMD for my brains folder and one of the things you'll
see once we look through it is it feels more like a table of contents than it does an instruction
set.
And the reason for that is that we've got the purpose, what's it going to be, where
are the locations.
So, if it needs anything from any of the brains, it can go to this particular location.
It's got a list of what it isn't.
That's also incredibly important because you don't want this to be the source of truth.
This is just the ideas we've been gathering.
And then when we look at the available brains, we've got one for Claude and we've got one
for BMAD, they read very keyword heavy so that when I type in a keyword such as what
would be the best practice for doing something in BMAD version 4, all of the information
matches to keywords in here so that it can then get to the correct documents it needs
to.
This document goes on to talk about some instructions for working with any of the brains.
But also this key line here is that there's an index which is the navigation hub for when
you are in that particular brain.
And this is what I mean by we don't need to put a lot of information into a Claude MD,
we just need to front load it with knowledge of where to find other knowledge.
