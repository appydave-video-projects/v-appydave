1
00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:04,650
Have you ever wanted to write video ad scripts that actually convert? If you've ever 

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:08,650
needed to write a script for YouTube or other sorts of content, you know that a video 

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:10,650
ad is at a whole different level.

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:16,350
In the last video, we built a script writing automation using PickAxe. Here's a snippet 

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,350
from that particular creation.

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:23,50
In this video, we're going to take things up a notch by adding in curated knowledge 

7
00:00:23,50 --> 00:00:28,530
based on exceptional ad scripts, and we're going to drop it into the PickAxe automation 

8
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:32,380
using the knowledge capability. I'm AppyDave. Let's get into it.

9
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:37,760
Okay, so our goal is to take the script writing bot that we used in the last video 

10
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:43,140
and level up its capabilities. And what we're going to do is start from the original 

11
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:48,120
hook based script, and we're going to go into PickAxe. And from here we can edit 

12
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,670
this particular PickAxe 

13
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:54,990
and we can see that it's simply a set of fields that we can fill in and a fairly 

14
00:00:54,990 --> 00:01:00,720
detailed prompt with insertion points for each of those fields. And that's what created 

15
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:05,910
the script that you just saw. What we'd like to do next is start making use of the 

16
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:11,40
knowledge base. And with the knowledge base, what we can do is get a curated list 

17
00:01:11,40 --> 00:01:16,890
of best practices for script writing, for say TikTok ads, or YouTube or Facebook 

18
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,990
ads. Load 'em all up in here. And we may also come back and change a little bit of 

19
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,890
the prompt to support the fact that we have a knowledge base. And let's say if 

20
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,890
we can do a much better video advertising script.

21
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:32,820
So the first thing we're going to do is we'll come to the knowledge base and we're 

22
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,860
going to connect a file. Now we haven't created a file yet. So let's see how we can 

23
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:43,220
do that. Now I've got in here a bunch of scripts from five different videos that 

24
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:49,460
are all quite similar to each other, which I thought were good examples of YouTube 

25
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:54,860
video ads, and I'll just read one of them from the top. You open ChatGPT like it's 

26
00:01:54,860 --> 00:02:00,60
a vending machine for viral content. But what came out? Beige emotionless buzzword 

27
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:05,660
salad. So this was the style of video I wanted to be able to reproduce for myself. 

28
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:10,940
So I've taken all five transcripts and I've just taken them over to ChatGPT where 

29
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:17,140
I've said read. And by doing that, I've put it into the knowledge base of a conversation. 

30
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:22,260
Once it's absorbed, I can then start doing some additional simple, prompt engineering 

31
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,860
to turn this into something really rich.

32
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:29,70
So rather than reading this bit of the prompt here, all it was was four different 

33
00:02:29,70 --> 00:02:33,950
questions that I was trying to gather information around the five scripts that I 

34
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:36,670
provided. So let's have a look at the answers to them.

35
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:41,230
So when it read through all five scripts, it worked out that four of them were actually 

36
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:46,470
all pretty similar in nature. They were this hard, impacting a lot of swear words 

37
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:52,390
aimed at a male Gen Z sort of audience, sort of aggressive humor. So I knew about 

38
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:57,150
that. There was also a fifth one in there that I hadn't been fully aware of the format, 

39
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:01,990
but it was basically the coaching unlock formula where you might have a statement 

40
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:04,790
like, here's how you actually do prompt engineering.

41
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:10,80
Now that led into my second question, which was what sort of advert were we seeing 

42
00:03:10,80 --> 00:03:15,120
here? And the reason this is important is that to reverse engineer and build your 

43
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,520
own high performing adverts, you can't just clone someone else. You have to understand 

44
00:03:21,00 --> 00:03:25,440
the nature of how it's put together and we can see this. What style of advert? So 

45
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,80
the shock and roast marketing is Gary Vee meets South Park sort of thing. 

46
00:03:30,90 --> 00:03:34,840
got pattern interrupt plus tribal rallying. So we've got pushes away the normies, 

47
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:41,00
attracts the rebels. So this particular style of advert is going to be really useful 

48
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:46,320
for a type of customer, a type of avatar if you like. But I did want to have other 

49
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:51,800
types of avatars that I could create video adverts for that would resonate with them 

50
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,760
more so than this particular style.

51
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:59,210
Now, my third question was other types of avatars. How would storytelling in video 

52
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:04,330
adverts relate to them? And it's come up with three tonal pivots to soften the structure. 

53
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:09,90
We've got the empathetic coach, curious teacher, and the story first mentor, 

54
00:04:09,90 --> 00:04:14,430
what I think we can do with the advertising script generation bot is have one seed 

55
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:20,630
story and produce 3 or 4 totally different types of adverts for different audiences.

56
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:25,240
The last question that I wanted clarity from was this separation of story from the 

57
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,200
actual structure of the adverts. So it's come up with the idea that you should be 

58
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:34,280
able to have a very simple and bland story that you work from, and from that it can 

59
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:40,360
identify the psychological triggers, like what's going on that we can hone in on 

60
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:46,00
for any sort of advertising structure. Once that's in place, we can wrap all of that 

61
00:04:46,00 --> 00:04:50,920
into an advertising transcript using the various structures. And we're looking at 

62
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:55,00
one here that has the hook, the punch, the insight and the call to action.

63
00:04:55,00 --> 00:05:00,140
Now we're about to do some research, but I had one more question to ask, and it was 

64
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:04,460
related to this statement that the three tonal pivots that we're seeing right here 

65
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:09,340
would soften the delivery. And the last thing I needed was for the adverts to lose 

66
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:14,620
their energy, to not do what adverts are meant to do, which is to create calls to 

67
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,820
action to have click through rates.

68
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:21,860
So I asked this question about will it affect the actual advertisements, and it's 

69
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:27,220
come up with some useful information stating that these styles can be really effective 

70
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,20
advertising 

71
00:05:28,30 --> 00:05:31,280
But you've got to make sure that things are punchy and that you don't slow down.

72
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:35,430
Now, the inside it's given on the new styles is that you don't need to be rude, which 

73
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:41,390
is what the first advert style was to create anxiety or tension within the adverts, 

74
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:46,680
which helps to create click through rates. And the TLDR the "too long, didn't read" 

75
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:52,230
is that for the empathetic coach, it would require fast emotional resonance. Immediate 

76
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:57,350
problem identification. We've got the curious teacher here high concept hook or a 

77
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:03,30
surprising truth in the next two seconds. And the story first mentor just needs to 

78
00:06:03,70 --> 00:06:06,510
tease the conflict fast and character connection. 

79
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:11,850
now while we're talking about TLDR, I want to take you over to AI. TLDR which is 

80
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:16,770
the whole reason that this video advert script system is being created.

81
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,760
Now AI-TLDR has been one of my experiment channels and in this it's currently got 

82
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:29,720
150 videos, 850 odd subscribers, and most of the videos here are all on various forms 

83
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:36,360
of AI style content creation, whether it be using notebook LLM or using design, which 

84
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:41,40
is an incredible animation tool. We use a lot of Leonardo. We've created a whole 

85
00:06:41,40 --> 00:06:45,920
video trailers with this and avatars. And it occurred to me that as I'm building 

86
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:51,280
out this particular channel, that all the lessons that are learned in this are really 

87
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,560
easy to transfer to people that want to create their own YouTube channels. The problem 

88
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:02,40
I had was that I didn't know how to send people to the actual course. It's not a 

89
00:07:02,40 --> 00:07:06,480
skill that I've got, so I thought the first thing I've got to do is create video 

90
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,440
advert trailers, 

91
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,450
and that's what we're enhancing in this PickAxe today.

92
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:14,240
So if you want to learn the multiple techniques that we're using on this particular 

93
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,520
channel to build AI generated content, then come over to AI. TLDR and there'll be 

94
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,800
a link in the description on how to access the upcoming course.

95
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:29,130
Now we're just about ready to create the document that will be in our knowledge base. 

96
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:34,730
So I've taken a screenshot of PickAxe all this information, including all the input 

97
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:40,210
variables, and I've asked it a question, basically stating that it should build up 

98
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:44,730
a detailed research question. And that's what it's gone and done. It's come up with 

99
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:49,370
information about understanding that there are five different advert styles that 

100
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:54,90
we want to work with, that it's about getting the structure, understanding how story 

101
00:07:54,90 --> 00:08:00,650
integration works. And also really important is can it come up with examples from 

102
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:04,770
the real world that fit these sort of advert structures? 

103
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,840
and then it's just going to structure the report for us. So let's see what it came 

104
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,80
up with.

105
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:14,320
So I ran the research prompt through ChatGPT Deep research. We've got a detailed 

106
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:18,680
activity log here. It asked a couple of questions up front about whether I wanted 

107
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,800
English or non-English. It also asked if I wanted to target a particular sort of 

108
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,960
product like coaching or e-commerce. And I said, no, this is only for digital courses. 

109
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:32,280
So everything that it's come up with, we've got the short form video scripts that 

110
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:37,520
you might see on the major social networks. We've got the different types of scripts 

111
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:42,360
worked out. Plus, how are the variables that we've already identified going to map 

112
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,320
into all of this?

113
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:47,900
So we have a detailed walkthrough of each of the five. We've got the roast to call 

114
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:52,740
out with the emotional effectiveness, the structure that goes on, and the type of 

115
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,300
audience that it would resonate with.

116
00:08:55,300 --> 00:09:00,240
It also talks about turning negative concepts into positive returns for the audience.

117
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:05,140
And we get a detailed analysis for the other four types. So with the Tactical Coach, 

118
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:10,390
what we're doing here is delivering quick wins and actionable value upfront. 

119
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,930
The empathetic coach is about deep emotional resonance and trust building. 

120
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:20,580
The Cur teacher is providing intrigue and intellectual stimulation. And what I think 

121
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:24,30
is interesting about all five types that we're looking at 

122
00:09:24,30 --> 00:09:30,40
is that we should be able to take any story, repurpose it, and put it out as a collection 

123
00:09:30,70 --> 00:09:34,120
of adverts of which some will resonate with people, some won't. 

124
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:40,70
so if you like to receive information in the story first mentor style, which is captivating 

125
00:09:40,70 --> 00:09:45,170
through narrative and authenticity, then you'll resonate with that advert style. 

126
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,60
whereas other people resonate with the story through a shock and awe sort of approach.

127
00:09:50,60 --> 00:09:54,700
Now it's also come up with a good variable mapping concept, and this is useful when 

128
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:59,980
we think of the way people can input into the tool. And they might not necessarily 

129
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:04,540
know what to fill in. Like do I type in shock? What does that actually mean? Do I 

130
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,300
do emotional failure?

131
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:11,80
What does that mean behind the scenes. And this has all been mapped. So when we look 

132
00:10:11,80 --> 00:10:16,720
at the hook type and we say this is what it can look like in a roast callout, but 

133
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,480
we've got one for each of the five different styles going on here.

134
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:25,630
Now it's given me three new variables. If I want to get really detailed in the configuration, 

135
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:30,70
I'm not sure if I'm going to do that with this particular version of the add bot, 

136
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:34,680
the one thing that's really powerful here is the real world examples by each of the 

137
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,880
different styles. So if we look at the roast call out examples.

138
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:43,740
Through to the empathetic coach. We're feeling burnt out. Juggling your business 

139
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:48,860
or family, I get it, I've been there, and it doesn't have to be that way. So all 

140
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:53,140
the way through here, we've got two different examples for each of the different 

141
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:58,820
styles that are based on real world adverts that actually convert and get business.

142
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:04,760
And the final set of instructions is how can we take simple stories and turn them 

143
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:09,760
into each of the different advert types step by step? So there's a real detailed 

144
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:16,200
analysis. With all this in place, the only thing to do is to download it and to upload 

145
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:22,520
it into PickAxe. And the good thing about deep research in ChatGPT is that you can 

146
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:26,920
go and click this button here, and what it does is make it available to you as a 

147
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:31,760
PDF. So we'll just click on that button and next we'll go and upload it into PickAxe.

148
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,500
Now, with our complete knowledge base downloaded, we can come over to PickAxe, click 

149
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:41,580
on the knowledge tab here and we can just connect the file. But you might be thinking 

150
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:46,460
so far that's actually been very detailed. And if you were to do it yourself, could 

151
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:51,780
you do it now? It's relatively easy to follow the the process, but if you want to 

152
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:56,380
work one on one with me, then just come over to AppyDave Comm. You can click on the 

153
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:01,340
Book a Call button, and from there we can either do a discovery session or just a 

154
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:06,940
one hour consult just to see what it is that you're trying to achieve. But for now, 

155
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:12,500
let's just click on the connect files. From there we can go add. With that I'm going 

156
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:17,580
to upload a file in this particular case. And I've put the file into the same place 

157
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,820
as this recording. And we'll just let it load in.

158
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:25,450
Now. Once it's finished uploading, we just click on the documents we want to connect 

159
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:27,330
and just press the connect button.

160
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:31,280
So with our document uploaded, we could turn it off. That's not the point of this. 

161
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:36,80
So we want to leave it on. And you can also have a look at it. Now the document is 

162
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:42,960
actually 34 pages long, with the final set of information just being some citations 

163
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,400
to other resources that it can look at. So a heck of a lot of great information that 

164
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:53,720
will help us generate our scripts effectively. One other thing that I've made a minor 

165
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:58,680
change to is just when should it pick it? Now it should pick it every time, I believe. 

166
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:04,120
But I've just said refer to the high performance, short form ad doc examples, structures 

167
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,240
and emotional hooks across the five different advert types.

168
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:12,600
Now I'm just going to make a small modification to the role. One of the big things 

169
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:18,200
is that the tailored platform trends and digital education products have been added 

170
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:23,800
in. Next thing is to have a look at the instruction set which had these original 

171
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,320
variables. We are going to need some new ones.

172
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:31,720
So I've taken the instruction, the prompt as such. It's got some modifications. One 

173
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:36,360
of the main ones being is that there are new variables being added. We've also got 

174
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:42,80
the add styles. This I'm going to do as a drop down. So let's just migrate it all 

175
00:13:42,80 --> 00:13:42,560
over.

176
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:47,940
Now I've taken the prompt from the original chat bot, and I've just updated it with 

177
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:51,980
anywhere there's a new field. So we've got the four that are going in right here. 

178
00:13:52,20 --> 00:13:58,20
There's also a new ad style which has been reproduced as a radio button list. That 

179
00:13:58,20 --> 00:14:03,260
way we can only select one particular value. I've also put in a little bit more description 

180
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:08,340
with each of the labels. So then when we look at it over from the public facing point 

181
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:13,180
of view, we've still got the same heading, the same description, but now we can select 

182
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:18,500
a particular ad style that we want to do and then go and fill the values. So let's 

183
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,460
give it a test.

184
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:24,120
So we're testing this out for the very first time. And I've started pre filling in 

185
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:29,200
some values. I'm going to go with the curious teacher approach. Now before I go into 

186
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:35,00
details of this I will also point out that I created a fake story. So the story is 

187
00:14:35,00 --> 00:14:39,80
I've been thinking about starting a YouTube channel for a while. I've tried a couple 

188
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,600
of times, recorded a few videos, tested some formats. So talks about different tools 

189
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:50,600
that I might have used 11 labs for voice capture, for video editing, Canva for presentation, 

190
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:56,480
sort of setup. And what I really want is a bunch of tutorials for the different styles 

191
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,920
of AI videos.

192
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:02,590
And the reason I've picked this particular storyline is that's exactly what we've 

193
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:08,140
done over on AI TLDR. We've gone through the process in the past of figuring out 

194
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:12,340
how do you do different sorts of videos, what sort of tools do you use? And this 

195
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:16,780
is actually the course that we want to market as a result of this script building 

196
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:22,570
exercise. So if we come back to the actual setup screen, we've got the curiosity 

197
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:24,460
teacher as the starting point, 

198
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:29,170
and we'll leave the hook tight at curiosity. Similar to the actual ad style we've 

199
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:34,180
got, I failed. This is too hard. This is some of the reasons why you give up on the 

200
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:38,680
different techniques. It's aimed at the person who would actually like to solve the 

201
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,850
problem for themselves. 

202
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:46,240
the value that we wanna reveal is an actual course or a mini framework per type of 

203
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,440
video that you want to do. 

204
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:53,50
and then it's going to direct people to a community and a course. 

205
00:15:53,60 --> 00:15:57,260
Now, I think in keeping with the curious teacher, I'm going to go with the tone as 

206
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:02,870
uplifting, the character archetype as coach and what's the belief that we're trying 

207
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:08,30
to shift? It's you need to hustle to, you just need a simple step-by-step guidance. 

208
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:13,580
So I'll just come back over here, copy. The fake story that we created, it was really 

209
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:18,950
just a generation, and I'm just going to paste it down into the story seed. Let's 

210
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:19,790
see what happens.

211
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,880
So we'll press submit 

212
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:25,300
So here's our first output. We've got the hook. Have you ever thought of starting 

213
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:30,340
a YouTube channel. But it's just impossible. You're not alone I get it. And through 

214
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:35,500
to a call to action, which is join our community today to transform your content 

215
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:41,20
creation journey. What I'll do next is I'm going to test this from a more vulgar, 

216
00:16:41,20 --> 00:16:45,820
rude, shock point of view, and I'm going to do it within the testing capability. 

217
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:48,140
And then we'll produce a little video around it.

218
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,410
Now I've come over here to test a more Hollywood action style. So we're going to 

219
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:57,750
go with the roast call out. Now we're gonna go with shock. Bad technique is the reason. 

220
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:03,60
It's the idea of gurus selling you false hope. We are going to reveal a framework 

221
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:08,700
via a direct offer and we will go with sarcastic and rude. The person talking will 

222
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:13,800
be a drill sergeant and we're going to go with a belief shift. You need to hustle 

223
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:18,750
to, you need to get a life and ultimately you're going to gain something. And we'll 

224
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:24,540
go with the Gary v Alex, her Mozy style, mentioning that it's okay to swear. Now 

225
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:29,310
for a story. I've also changed the story right up a bit and I've said the content 

226
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,60
protocol 

227
00:17:30,60 --> 00:17:34,600
and we got this idea of I woke up in a hotel room with no memory, a half rendered 

228
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:39,880
cap cut timeline playing on a loop, and a whispering in voice in my ear that says 

229
00:17:40,00 --> 00:17:45,10
the algorithm has been compromised. So this has much more of a story appeal. So we'll 

230
00:17:45,10 --> 00:17:51,70
just copy all of that, come back and paste it in and press test prompt and see what 

231
00:17:51,70 --> 00:17:51,880
happens.

232
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:58,30
So it's starting to write out a story and it goes with hey, yeah, you looking, scrolling 

233
00:17:58,30 --> 00:18:02,590
mindlessly, still thinking of those get rich quick videos will save your life.

234
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,660
So rather than me reading this out, what I'll do is I'll turn it into a quick eye 

235
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,620
video and let's see how it sounds.

236
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:13,620
So I wanna give you a conclusion and also just talk about one other aspect of this. 

237
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:20,250
So in conclusion, this creation of a script is not a lot better than the previous 

238
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:26,100
example. It's, it's okay, but the use of rag hasn't worked exactly the way I want. 

239
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,690
But let's have a look into why that could be. So if you go down to this little magnifying 

240
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:31,980
glass here and click on it, 

241
00:18:32,00 --> 00:18:34,670
get to see the full prompt explored, 

242
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:40,530
which would be an improvement if we could, but what we can do is explore what information 

243
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:43,230
came out of the knowledge base. So at 

244
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:48,690
file name and we can see all the information that was returned and made available 

245
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:54,870
to the prompt. Now I increased the size of the information being returned and the 

246
00:18:54,870 --> 00:19:00,240
relevancy score. So all the relevancy scores here on the right are fairly high. 

247
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:05,50
They're all above an initial value of 75. So if we go all the way down to the bottom, 

248
00:19:05,80 --> 00:19:10,900
we don't see anything under 75. I also have a cutoff of a roundabout 

249
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:15,800
and it's that 3000 character limit, which is why this little green line is here. 

250
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:21,860
So what I think I want to do in future examples of using the rag and the knowledge 

251
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:27,320
base is to maybe split the file up into both the structure and the examples 

252
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:31,730
and maybe even a file of just turning stories into scripts 

253
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:37,200
so that I get much better modeling of input values to expected output values.

254
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,570
Anyway, I'm AppyDave. If you want to work one on one with me, then book a call. Otherwise
