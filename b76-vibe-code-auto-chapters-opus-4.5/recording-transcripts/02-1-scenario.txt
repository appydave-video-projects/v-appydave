So where I plan to start is that we've just recorded a video it's 18 seconds
long and as soon as I hit rename it's going to go into my recordings folder as
chapter 1 sequence 1 and it'll be the intro now as that happens we should see
it end up in the recordings here and we should see transcriptions being created
at the same time so if we go over to our folder structure as well so we can see
things getting added automatically we'll hit the rename button and what should
happen is we get a recordings folder just here and there's the recordings
folder and we've got a transcription folder being created but we don't
currently have a transcript right now let's have a look at what's coming here
we've got the recording and we go to the transcript we can see that the
transcript is processing and there's the transcript
