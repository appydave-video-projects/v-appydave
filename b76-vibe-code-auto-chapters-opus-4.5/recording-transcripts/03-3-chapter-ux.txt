Now, while we're talking about UX changes, you might've just noticed a couple have happened
and I'm about to run another one.
So since this is a continuous vibe coding session that I've been doing for a few days,
I'll just show you a little bit about what's going on.
So the change I've just made right now is that I've moved the config up to this level
because it's not really something I need to use very often.
The other thing I've done is made sure that the current project that I'm working on is
just showing up here.
So if we come to another project and we will be switching between these two projects, we
can see it right here.
So we'll come back to the chapters that we're working on, go to the recordings and I'm about
to add in some new capabilities.
Because we know that this is chapter one and that it's 18 seconds, we know that on YouTube,
if this wasn't edited, this would be 00 colon 00 and we know that this one would be about
00 colon 19.
So what I've just done.
