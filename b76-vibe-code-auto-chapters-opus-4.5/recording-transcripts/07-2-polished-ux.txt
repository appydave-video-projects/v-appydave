So to get to this stage, this is what we worked on. So we came in with an MVP that
had all been vibe coded by Claude code and it did about 80% of what I needed it
to do. We then had a number of requirements conversations talking
about how it would work and it gave me user interface improvements and what
that did at a high level was give us basically the information we're seeing
here. It's very clear that things might be wrong, might need looking at. We've
still got a little bit of issues with the detail. I'll work on that in another
session and then after that we also improved the algorithms because the
algorithms that are initially used it coded itself so I said I need you to use
third-party libraries so I know it's best practice. So the next
thing I would need to do to finish this off is come down to the video we're
actually working on and be able to run and be able to run that process but that
requires me to edit this video so you'll see this so you'll see this right at the
end of the video.
