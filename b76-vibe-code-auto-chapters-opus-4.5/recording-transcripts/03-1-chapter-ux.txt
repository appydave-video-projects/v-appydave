Let's now consider the user experience when managing these chapters so at the
moment we've got two chapters intro and scenario the intro is currently an 18
second video while the outro is these four videos and they add up to about a
hundred and sixty seconds or two minutes forty but from a timing point of view if
this was a YouTube description what we would want is that the intro is at zero
zero colon zero zero it goes for 18 seconds which means that the next video
the scenario which means that the next section which means that the next
chapter which is the scenario should start at about zero zero colon 19 and if
we based it purely off those recordings that would be about what the numbers are
but the reality is that the editor might end up editing this particular video so
rather than it being 18 seconds long it could end up being 15 seconds long which
means this one would start at say 16 seconds
