So, what going through that reversed engineered specification told me was that Claude Coat
had done a good job at trying to solve the problem.
It had written a bunch of algorithms, done a little bit of search on the problem and
come up with a solution.
But the problem is that it really didn't use best practices and I started asking it a few
questions.
So, the first one was, were there a bunch of quick wins that we could have done to just
improve the numbers, the confidence?
Was there a way that we could have looked at the algorithms a little bit differently?
And I also had some questions about the user experience because it was a bit painful to
work with.
So, I read through the quick wins and improvements and they just seemed to be improvements on
what it was currently doing and I thought there must have been a smarter way than just
hand crafting.
And I thought there must have been a smarter way than just hand crafting this stuff.
It did suggest that I could use a large language model.
And there's this one phrase here that's interesting because this is something the algorithms wouldn't
do a good job of just understanding the sentence.
But I'm not convinced that's the direct answer just yet.
It's really the way I want to close off this feature.
And I also asked it to look at the UI problem and we can see what it's come up with.
And there's some really good examples.
I really liked the one that was showing up here.
