So let's look at a little update that I'm planning to do and it's this new
user experience just going on here. I had a little conversation just into the
microphone of what I was observing and the first thing I recognized was I
needed some sort of smart timing or smart labeling of times and so I've got
it to think through the idea of a shared function that I can use in different
scenarios so that I can show things as 18, 18 seconds, I can show it as 0018, I
can show it as 0.3 minute and we've got these different variations because I
know that when I start seeing time on the web interface I might want smart
formatting in these particular areas because one of the things I've asked for
is that can I get the total time now I don't know whether it should be seconds
or minutes but with this new formatting about to happen we should be able to
get something that works well. Next thing I've asked it to do is look at the
chapter duration totals so when we've got four different videos what are the
totals and this is what it currently shows and this is the proposed solution
now it's also come up with this so it's so it's also come up with this
cumulative value and this is going to be useful because what we're seeing here
with these numbers on the right is close to what the YouTube chapter timings will
be obviously it'll be different once the videos are edited and so I'm just going
to say can you turn this into a requirement for the developer and we'll
let that come through and it's just going to write up something for me and
at the same time the developer which is operating in this window has has just
written up a bunch of handover documents for what the product owner
needs to know about. Now to be honest I haven't been verifying this too much but
I will take the information and I will paste it back into the product owner that
way the product owner knows what the developer has been working on and we'll
kick that off so that it can go and update any documents it needs to but
then what we can do is go back to this developer handover document and take
everything up to the section that we just pasted in go to the developer and
say can you start implementing this capability so what should happen at the
end of this is that this page here should start getting new values shown on
it hopefully we're going to see things around smarter time formatting we should
be able to see cumulative values so I should have a gut feel so I should have
an idea of where the chapter timings are meant to be and if we go down to the
developer we can see it started writing the code for the formatting of durations
next it's going to add the chapter duration total next it's going to add
the chapter duration totals and headings and then while that's happening my screen
has crashed so it's in the middle of breaking the code base at the moment and
then it comes back alive again because this is all using hot module reloading
so any code that changes behind the scenes we see it visually and we're
starting to see the smart formatting coming through so we got 18 seconds and
we're also seeing the total so this is 18 seconds for this video this is 2
minutes and 41 for those four videos and it looks like we can see where the
chapter timings would be as well so this would start at zero this would start at
18 seconds this one would start this one would start at 2 minutes and 59 seconds
so we'll just come back to the developer we can see we can see that we've got a
handover document so I can just come over to the product owner and just paste
that in just letting the product owner know that they can update any
requirements they need to and keep track of the backlog and the change log
