Now we've just got to the end of the coding session and we have a much
improved user interface. So when things are just working perfectly we should see
a green here, a green here and a grey number. It's quite okay to see a pink
line it just means that it's found the correct location to put the chapter but
it was recorded in a different video out of sequence from the normal video
recording workflow. The yellow just says that it's got low confidence that it got
it right and we'll look at how we'll fix that in the future and we can see
various user interface components here that aren't really that user friendly
right now so I'll deal with that in another session. And so so far I'm really
confident that this is getting me about 90-95% of the way through to a clean and
simple chapter creation process.
