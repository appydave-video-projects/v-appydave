And so to see where this is all going to be I've decided it's going to be in the
projects directory. Now we're currently working on this chapters video at the
moment and we can see already that we have three chapters because I just
started a third one. We're up to six recordings but we've only got 83% of the
transcriptions in place and that's because one of them is in the middle of
transcribing right now. Now I've also got this little info button and what this is
designed to do is tell us a lot of metadata about the video we're on. We can
see that it was edited a minute ago, we've got the recordings, we've got the
chapters, we can just see that that just increased to 100% so that's done but
what we don't see is a list of the broken down chapters and the reality is
we can't do it right now with this video because we don't have an SRT file of the
final video.
