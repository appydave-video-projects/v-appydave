Now, an example of another timestamp might be what I just showed, which is the scenario.
So what I might do here is create a new chapter, and this is going to be for the two files
that we've recorded, and it's Chapter 2, Sequence 1, and we'll put in scenario, and we'll make
sure that the first file has gone over.
We will not delete the other one because we want that one to go over as well.
So now what's happening is we've got two more recordings, and we've got two transitions,
and we've got two transcriptions getting ready to be transcribed.
And when they're all finished, what will end up happening is we'll be able to see the individual
transcriptions here, and soon we'll also have a combine button for these two once they're
transcribed, and we'll be able to see the full chapter transcription.
