So here we have our scenario it's made up of three videos there are three
individual transcripts we could look at them one at a time just like this and
what we can then do is click the combine this brings them all together into one
text file so they're all in one bit and this is all the context we really need
to help us come up with a good chapter name for scenario. Scenario might be okay
but we might want something contextually the same as whatever's being written here
