So what should have happened right then is a whole set of chapter recordings
have come in. They're all queued at the moment. We can head over to the
transcriptions. Everything's progressing. I notice there's a little bug when we go
to the recordings. Well maybe it's a bug but the idea of the combine is only
showing up where we've got a transcription. I personally don't want to
see it unless I've got all the transcriptions.
