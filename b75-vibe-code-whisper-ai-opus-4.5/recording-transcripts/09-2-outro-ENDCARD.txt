So I think for the next video we'll continue the Opus 4.5 and what we'll do
is we'll come over to the system where the different recordings get combined
into one video and at that point we use a digital asset management system that
we've built and we'll integrate it into this. And what that's planning to do is
take these files that are basically local to my computer at the moment and
make them available in S3 drives, also Glacier and also NAS, a network
addressable storage system in another country. So that's the progress we want
to start on in the next video. I'm Happy Dave. I'm Happy Dave. Please like and
subscribe. I'll see you in the next video.
