In video number one in this series, we essentially built this recording namer application.
We did it all with VibeCoding and it had the ability to watch for videos from an Ecamm live stream
and put them directly into a project directory.
By the end of that video, any incoming recordings, and at the moment we've got the one I'm doing right now,
would be ready to be either discarded or put into the recordings folder.
And this is how it would work. I would do a rename on the one that I like and I would discard the rest
and what would be left with is a recording stored somewhere on the computer.
