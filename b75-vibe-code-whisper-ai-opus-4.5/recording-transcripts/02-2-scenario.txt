Now the other capability I want from the transcription system is that when a
chapter is finished and currently this is the intro I would like to bundle up
all the text and be able to figure out things like what should the chapter link
from an SEO perspective be. So if we go back to the incoming where I've just
finished a video and I'm calling it the scenario and we rename it what should
happen at this point because we are on a new chapter is that all of these
transcriptions should be bundled up together so that I can do chapter level
transcript so that I can do chapter level assessment with large language
models.
