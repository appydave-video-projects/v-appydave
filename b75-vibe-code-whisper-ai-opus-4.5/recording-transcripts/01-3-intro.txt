In the second video on the Opus 4.5, I demonstrated that new capabilities were added.
We had projects, we had thumbnails that we could preview and add to the video that we were recording.
We'd have assets that we could then go and manage and assign next to different videos.
And we developed a few more capabilities around the tagging and the statuses of videos.
So as I'd add in a second video here, we could see it available over in the recording.
And by this point, this application was already doubling the productivity that I was doing with YouTube videos.
