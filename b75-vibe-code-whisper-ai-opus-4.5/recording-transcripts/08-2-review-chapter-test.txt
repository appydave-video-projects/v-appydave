So what I've done is I've combined it I did that by mistake we'll go and do
another one in a moment but let's click on view and see what we've got and this
is okay it probably won't be good in the future I don't think I want to see the
actual video names in here but for testing this is perfect so we can see
that I said so here's my chapter test the quick brown fox jumped over the
lazy dog and went straight to a link in the description where he could go to
Appy Dave school on context engineering this is really cool because everything
has worked except this is really cool because everything has worked correctly
except you may want that to say SK double O L so spelled it correctly but
there may be the ability to have context understanding built into the
transcription which I might want in the future let's see what this button does
I'm assuming it's going to copy it to the clipboard and this is going to open
it in the folder system is it it has and we can see the file down here so one
last test we're just going to go to this big one we'll do a combine and then we
will do view and then we will do clipboard and then we will do paste and
there's all the chapter and there's all the sequences from one chapter are all
listed and there's all the sequences from one chapter all listed
