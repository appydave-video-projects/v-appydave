So I'm coming over to our product owner and I just want to check what functional requirements
we have that are pending.
There are a lot that are being done.
And so he's reading from the backlog at the moment.
And some of this may need to be cleaned up.
I'm not sure whether they're being done or not.
I've just been keeping them in the backlog.
But the one we're interested in today is FR-30.
And the first thing that we're going to do is ask it, can you create a handover document
for the developer for FR-30, which is the video transcription requirements?
And what we're doing is we're just letting that go into the conversation stream.
And because this document and because this conversation should only be about reading,
writing, and validating the requirements, when information needs to go to the developer,
we give handover notes.
You can see that one of the main documents that the PO was reading was this video transcription
spec.
This was a short conversation I had just before starting this video.
Now we will go and read the video transcription spec in a moment.
But this is essentially the handover document.
And what we can do is just go up to the developer and say, can you implement something like
that?
And we'll just paste in that particular information.
Now what should happen is the developer should start writing the code for us following the
specification.
