and we'll start again and what happens is we've got the quick brown fox video
it's only 13 seconds long we'll hit rename on that head back to our
transcripts we now have two that are in the queue so another one that's just
finished we've got the next one in the queue this is the one I want to go and
test the text on while I'm doing that it also did another thing that I wasn't
sure about and we can see when we're looking at the recordings which ones
have transcripts which ones transcribing which ones queued and I
guess I'm going to have to add some buttons here so that I can transcribe
the ones that don't have transcriptions I think while we're waiting we should
just kick off a development environment for that we're going to need an updated
requirements document
