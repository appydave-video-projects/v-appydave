So let's just get straight into coding or at the very least understanding the
agents we're going to work with. So I'm just in the flyvideonamer project at the
moment and I'm going to run Claude in dangerous skip permissions which means
that it won't ask me if it needs to change any files or run any sort of
command. I will also just kick off this little starter prompt just to find out
what information is in our Claude MD. Now for the last couple of days the whole
conversation for writing requirements has been down here in the bottom right
hand corner but it's very unstructured but it's very unstructured and the reason
for that is that I didn't want to use any context engineering I just wanted to
find out what the Opus 4.5 model could do and it is exceptional but now that
the application is getting a little bit bigger but now that the application is
getting a bit more complex I would like to have a bit of structure and maybe a
couple of agents.
