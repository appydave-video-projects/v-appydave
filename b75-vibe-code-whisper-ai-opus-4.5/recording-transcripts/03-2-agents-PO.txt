So I've just brought an old development conversation down here. I don't think I
need it but I want to keep it for context and I'm just going to say for
this one is what is your role what are the basic responsibilities of the
product owner and we can see the basic ideas the responsibility is to gather
requirements from me we've got general documents that we want to work with a
backlog of ideas anytime we change something we need to keep a change log
and we've got some implementation notes and user stories basically and user
stories or specifications now this is not the be mad method which is usually
what I do for complex applications but I have instructed it to have at least
some form of context engineering going on so that we don't make so as the
application gets a little bit more complex it's just not making silly
mistakes because it doesn't have enough context available
